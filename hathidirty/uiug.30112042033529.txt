as Nourjahad the ſon of Namarand.
This young man was about the age

No'urjahad as the riſing ﬅar 'of the
Perſian court, whom his maﬅer's par.-

his faults; but they appeared to him'-
only ſuch as are almoﬅ-inſeparable from
youth and inexperience; and he made
no doubt' but that Nourjahad, [when
time had a little more ſubdued his
youthſul' paſiions, and matured his:
judgment, would be able to ﬁll the place-
of his ﬁrﬅ miniﬅer, with abilities equal
to any of his predeceſſors.- He would
. not, however, even in his own private
thoughts, refolve on ſo important a ﬅſiep,
without ﬁrſt conſulting with ſome old
lords of his court, who had been the
conﬅant friends add counſdllors of the
late ſultan= his father. Accordingly hav-

Nourjahad, ſaid the ſultan, ﬁnding that
they all continUed ſilent, looking-at each

the counſellors. 'That objection, an-
ſwered Schemzeddin, will grow lighter'
every day. His avarice, cried the ſe-
cond; Thou art not juﬅ, ſaid the' ſul- ſi
ran, in charging him With'that; he has
no ſupport but from my bounty, nor
did he ever yet take advantage of that
intereﬅ which he knows he has in me,

charged him with, is in his nature not-i
withﬅanding, replied the old lord;

Schemzeddin, is as groundleſs, an accu-

from his childhood, and think ſew men
of his years are ſo temperate. Yet:
Would he indulge to exceſs, iſ it were

ſultan now addreſſed the fourth :- What:

8- THE HISTORY
' Though Schemzeddin ſeemed diſ--
pleaſed with the remonﬅranCCs of the
Old men, they nevertheleſs had ſome
weight with him. It is the intereﬅ of
Nouxjahad, ſaid he, to conceal his faults
from me; the age and errperience of
theſe men doubtleſs has furniſhed them
with more ſagacity than my youth can
boaﬅ of; and he may. be in reality what
they '_ have repreſented him. This
' thought diſquieted the ſultan, for he
loved Nourjahad as his brother. Yet
who knows, cried he, but it may be
envy in theſe old men? they may be
provoked at having a youth raiſed to
that honour to which each of them per-
haps in his own heart aſpires. ' iVVe can
ſometimes form a better judgment of a
man's real diſpoſition, from an unguard

ed ſally of his own lips, than from a
cloſe obſervation of years, where the
perſon, ConſeioUs of being obſerved, is'-
watchful and' cautious of every look and'
expreſſion that falls from him.- I will--
ſound Nourjahad when he leaﬅ-ſuſpects
that'I have any ſuch deſign, and from?
his OWn- mouth will I judge him.
It was not' long before the ſdltan had'-
an'opportunity of executing his purpoſe. -
Having þaﬅ the evening with his ſa-
vourite at a banquet, where they had
i ' both indulged pretty freely, he invited-
Nouxjahad to'a walk by moon-light in- -
the gardens of the ſeraglio. Schemzedd
din leaned on his ſhoulder as they ram--
bled from one deliciousſcene to another 5;
ſcenes rendered ﬁill more enchanting byv

the ſilence of the night, the mild luﬅre
of the moon now at full, and the exhau
lations which aroſe fiom a thouſand
odoriferous ſhrubs. _ The ſpirits of'
Nourjahad were exhilarated by the
'mirth and feﬅivity in which he had
paſſed the day. The ſultan's favour
intoxicated him; his thoughts were
diſiipated by a variety of agreeable ſen
fations, his whole foul as it were
rapt in a kind of pleaſing delirium.
Such was the frame of Nowjahad's
mind, when the ſultan, with an aſſumed'
-leVity, throwing himſelf down on a
bank of Violets, and familiarly drawing
his favourite to ſit by him, ſaid, Tell me,
Nourialmd, and tell me truh, what would

favourite, are ſo boundleſs, that it is
impoſſible for me to tell you directly 51

ceedingiy mortiﬁed that his unguandcd
declaration had ſo, much leſſened him
in his maﬅer's eﬅeem, retired to his-
own houſe, which immediately joined?
the ſultan's palace.v '
He paſſed the reﬅ of the night in tra-'r
verſing his chamber, being unable to:
take any reﬅ. He dreaded the thoughts-
of loſing the ſultan's favour, on which.
alone he depended for his future ad-

he remained mute, and motionleſs, for
ſome minutes; but he was rouſed from
- his deep attention, by a loud burﬅ of v
laughter, which broke at once from the
ſultan, the viſier, and the guardian
- genius.
This 'new and extraordinary incident
threw Nourjahad into freſh aﬅoniſh-

to recover himſelf, the angelic youth,

light curls on his ctneck and bluſhing

loved and beautiful Mandana!
Whatever tranſports the ſight of
would at another time have inſpired in
the breaﬅ of Nourjahad, his faculties
were now too much abſorbed in wonder,
to leave room for any other paſſion.
Wherefore, not daring to approach her,
the ſultan,'willing to put an end to his

deception, and a piece of machinery of
my contrivance. You are now con-

no other than this young damſel.
I had a mind to make trial of thy
heart, and for this purpoſe made choice i
of this charming Virgin, for' whom I p
ſown' I. had entertained a paﬂion, but
found I could not gain her aﬀectidns.

She readily aſſented to my propoſal,

and could ſcarce contain my laughter,
when you ſo greedily received that
marvellous eſſence from Mandana;

nothing more than a ſoporiﬁc drug, of
i 'ſo potent a nature, that the fumes of it
alone, were capable of throwing the
perſon who ſmelt them into a proſound ,

extraordinary poliſh and luﬅre, that
they might well paſs for jewels of in-

The ingots of gold were all baſe
metal, which 'I got from the ſame
