 'ELL, suh, dat's a fac dat's what Marse 
 George al'ays said. 'Tis hard to spile 
 Christmas anyways." 
 The speaker was " Unc' Edinburg," the driver from 
 Werrowcoke, where I was going to spend Christmas ; 
 the time was Christmas Eve, and the place the mud 
 diest road in eastern Virginia a measure which, I feel 
 sure, will, to those who have any experience, establish 
 its claim to distinction. 
 
 A half-hour before he had met me at the station, 
 the queerest-looking, raggedest old darkey conceivable, 
 brandishing a cedar-staffed whip of enormous propor 
 tions in one hand, and clutching in the other a calico 
 letter-bag with a twisted string ; and with the excep-

 tion of a brief interval of temporary suspicion on his 
 part, due to the unfortunate fact that my luggage 
 consisted of only a hand-satchel instead of a trunk, we 
 had been steadily progressing in mutual esteem. 
 
 "Dee's a boy standin' by my mules; I got de 
 ker'idge heah for you," had been his first remark on 
 my making myself known to him. " Mistis say as 
 how you might bring a trunk." 
 
 I at once saw my danger, and muttered something 
 about " a short visit," but this only made matters 
 worse. 
 
 " Dee don' nobody nuver pay short visits dyah," he 
 said, decisively, and I fell to other tactics. 
 
 "You couldn' spile Christmas den noways," he 
 repeated, reflectingly, while his little mules trudged 
 knee-deep through the mud. " Twuz Christmas den, 
 sho' 'nough," he added, the fires of memory smoulder 
 ing, and then, as they blazed into sudden flame, he 
 asserted, positively : " Dese heah free-issue niggers 
 don' know what Christmas is. Hawg meat an' pop 
 crackers don' meek Christmas. Hit tecks ole times 
 to meek a sho' - 'nough, tyahin' - down Christmas. 
 Gord ! I's seen 'em ! But de wuss Christmas I ever 
 seen tunned out de best in de een," he added, with 
 sudden warmth, " an' dat wuz de Christmas me an'

 Marse George an' Reveller all got drownded down at 
 Braxton's Creek. You's hearn 'bout dat 1 ? " 
 
 As he was sitting beside me in solid flesh and blood, 
 and looked as little ethereal in his old hat and patched 
 clothes as an old oak stump would have done, and as 
 Colonel Staunton had made a world-wide reputation 
 when he led his regiment through the Chickahom- 
 iny thickets against McClellan's intrenchments, I was 
 forced to confess that I had never been so favored, 
 but would like to hear about it now; and with a hitch 
 of the lap blanket under his outside knee, and a su 
 pererogatory jerk of the reins, he began : 
 
 " Well, you know, Marse George was jes' eighteen 
 when he went to college. I went wid him, 'cause me 
 an' him wuz de same age ; I was born like on a 
 Sat'day in de Christmas, an' he wuz born in de new 
 year on a Chuesday, an' my mammy nussed us bofe at 
 one breast. Dat's de reason maybe huccome we took 
 so to one nurr. He sutney set a heap o' sto' by me ; 
 an' I ain' nuver see nobody yit wuz good to me as 
 Marse George." 
 
 The old fellow, after a short reverie, went on : 
 
 " Well, we growed up togerr, jes as to say two 
 stalks in one hill. We cotch ole hyahs togerr, an' we 
 hunted 'possums togerr, an' 'coons. Lord ! he wuz a

 climber ! I 'member a fight he had one night up in 
 de ve'y top of a big poplar tree wid a coon, whar he 
 done gone up after, an' he flung he hat over he head ; 
 an' do' de varmint leetle mo' tyah him all to pieces, 
 he fotch him down dat tree 'live ; an' me an' him had 
 him at Christmas. 'Coon meat mighty good when 
 dee fat, you know *? " 
 
 As this was a direct request for my judgment, I 
 did not have the moral courage to raise an issue, al 
 though my views on the subject of 'coon meat are well 
 known to my family ; so I grunted something which 
 I doubt not he took for assent, and he proceeded : 
 
 " Dee warn' nuttin he didn' lead de row in ; he 
 wuz de bes' swimmer I ever see, an' he handled a 
 skiff same as a fish handle heself. An' I wuz wid him 
 constant; wharever you see Marse George, dyah 
 Edinburg sho', jes' like he shadow. So twuz, when 
 he went to de university ; 'twarn' nuttin would do but 
 I got to go too. Marster he didn' teck much to de 
 notion, but Marse George wouldn' have it no urr way, 
 an' co'se mistis she teck he side. So I went 'long as 
 he body-servant to teck keer on him an' help meek 
 him a gent'man. An' he wuz, too. From time he 
 got dyah tell he cum 'way he wuz de head man. 
 
 " Dee warn' but one man dyah didn' compliment

 him, an' dat wuz Mr. Darker. But .he warn' nuttin ! 
 not dat he didn' come o' right good fambly 'cep' dee 
 politics ; but he wuz sutney pitted, jes' like sometimes 
 you see a weevly runty pig in a right good litter. 
 Well, Mr. Darker he al'ays 'ginst Marse George ; he 
 hate me and him bofe, an' he sutney act mischeevous 
 todes us ; 'cause he know he warn' as we all. De 
 Stauntons dee wuz de popularitiest folks in Virginia ; 
 an' dee wuz high-larnt besides. So when Marse George 
 run for de medal, an' wuz to meek he gret speech, 
 Mr. Darker he speak 'ginst him. Dat's what Marse 
 George whip him 'bout. 'Ain' nobody nuver told you 
 'bout dat?" 
 
 I again avowed my misfortune; and although it 
 manifestly aroused new doubts, he worked it off on 
 the mules, and once more took up his story : 
 
 " Well, you know, dee had been speakin' 'ginst one 
 nurr ev'y Sat'dy night ; and ev'ybody knowed Marse 
 George wuz de bes' speaker, but dee give him one 
 mo' sho', an' dee was bofe gwine spread deeselves, an' 
 dee wuz two urr gent'mens also gwine speak. An' 
 dat night when Mr. Darker got up he meek sich a 
 fine speech ev'ybody wuz s'prised ; an' some on 'em 
 say Mr. Darker done beat Marse George. But, shuh ! 
 I know better'n dat ; an' Marse George face look so

 curious ; but, suh, when he riz I knowed der wuz 
 somen gwine happen I wuz leanin' in de winder. 
 He jes step out in front an' throwed up he head like 
 a horse wid a rank kyurb on him, and den he begin ; 
 an' twuz jes like de river when hit gits out he bank. 
 He swep' ev'ything. When he fust open he mouf I 
 knowed twuz comin' ; he face wuz pale, an' he wuds 
 tremble like a fiddle-string, but he eyes wuz blazin', 
 an' in a minute he wuz jes reshin'. He voice soun' 
 like a bell ; an' he jes wallered dat turr man, an' 
 wared him out ; an' when he set down dee all yelled 
 an' hollered so you couldn' heah you' ears. Gent'- 
 mans, twuz royal ! 
 
 " Den dee tuck de vote, an' Marse George got it 
 munanimous, an' dee all hollered agin, all 'cep' a few o' 
 Mr. Barker's friends. An' Mr. Darker he wuz de 
 second. An' den dee broke up. An' jes den Marse 
 George walked thoo de crowd straight up to him, 
 an' lookin' him right in de eyes, says to him, ' You 
 stole dat speech you made to-night.' Well, suh, 
 you ought to 'a hearn 'em ; hit soun' like a mill- 
 dam. You couldn' heah nuttin 'cep' roarin', an' you 
 couldn' see nuttin 'cep' shovin'. But, big as he wuz, 
 Marse George beat him ; an' when dee pull him off, 
 do' he face wuz mighty pale, he stan' out befo' 'em all,

 " Unc Edinburg' : 7 
 
 dem whar wuz 'ginst him, an' all, jes as straight as an 
 arrow, an' say : ' Dat speech wuz written an' printed 
 years ago by somebody or nurr in Congress, an' this 
 man stole it ; had he beat me only, I should not have 
 said one word ; but as he has beaten others, I shall 
 show him up ! ' Gord, suh, he voice wuz clear as a 
 game rooster. I sutney wuz proud on him. 
 
 " He did show him up, too, but Mr. Darker ain' 
 wait to see it ; he lef ' dat night. An' Marse George 
 he wuz de popularitiest gent'man at dat university. 
 He could handle dem students dyah same as a man 
 handle a hoe. 
 
 " Well, twuz de next Christmas we meet Miss 
 Charlotte an' Nancy. Mr. Braxton invite we all to 
 go down to spen' Christmas wid him at he home. 
 An' sich a time as we had ! 
 
 " We got dyah Christmas Eve night dis very 
 night jes befo' supper, an' jes natchelly froze to 
 death," he pursued, dealing in his wonted hyperbole, 
 " an' we jes had time to git a apple toddy or two 
 when supper was ready, an' wud come dat dee wuz 
 waitin' in de hall. I had done fix Marse George up 
 gorgeousome, I tell you ; an when he walk down 
 dem stairs in dat swaller-tail coat, an' dem paten'- 
 leather pumps on, dee warn nay one dyah could tetch

 him ; he looked like he own 'em all. I jes rest my 
 mind. I seen him when he shake hands wid 'em all 
 roun', an' I say, ' Um-m-m ! he got 'em.' 
 
 "But he ain' teck noticement o' none much tell 
 Miss Charlotte come. She didn' live dyah, had jes 
 come over de river dat evenin' from her home, 'bout 
 ten miles off, to spen' Christmas like we all, an' she 
 come down de stairs jes as Marse George finish shakin' 
 hands. I seen he eye light on her as she come down 
 de steps smilin', wid her dim blue dress trainin' be 
 hind her, an' her little blue foots peepin' out so pretty, 
 an' holdin' a little hankcher, lookin' like a spider- 
 web, in one hand, an' a gret blue fan in turr, spread 
 out like a peacock tail, an' jes her roun' arms an' 
 th'oat white, an' her gret dark eyes lightin' up her 
 face. I say, ' Dyah 'tis ! ' and when de ole Cun'l stan' 
 aside an' interduce 'em, and Marse George step for'ard 
 an' meek he grand bow, an' she sort o' swing back an' 
 gin her curtchy, wid her dress sort o' dammed up 
 'ginst her, an' her arms so white, an' her face sort o' 
 sunsetty, I say, ' Yes, Lord ! Edinburg, dyah you 
 mistis.' Marse George look like he think she done 
 come down right from de top o' de blue sky an' bring 
 piece on it wid her. He ain' nuver took he eyes 
 from her dat night. Dee glued to her, mun ! an' she

 well, do' she mighty rosy, an' look mighty uncon- 
 sarned, she sutney ain' hender him. Hit look like 
 kyarn nobody else tote dat fan an' pick up dat hank- 
 cher skusin o' him ; an' after supper, when dee all 
 playin' blind-man's-buff in de hall I don' know 
 how twuz but do' she jes as nimble as a filly, an' 
 her ankle jes as clean, an' she kin git up her dress an' 
 dodge out o' de way o' ev'ybody else, somehow or 
 nurr she kyarn help him ketchin' her to save her life ; 
 he al'ays got her corndered ; an' when dee'd git fur 
 apart, dat ain' nuttin, dee jes as sure to come togerr 
 agin as water is whar you done run you hand thoo. 
 An' do' he kiss ev'ybody else under de mistletow, 
 'cause dee be sort o' cousins, he ain' nuver kiss her, 
 nor nobody else ain't nurr, 'cep' de ole Cun'l. I wuz 
 standin' down at de een de hall wid de black folks, 
 an' I notice it 'tic'lar, 'cause I done meek de 'quaint- 
 ance o' Nancy; she wuz Miss Charlotte's maid; a 
 mighty likely young gal she wuz den, an' jes as impi- 
 dent as a fly. She see it too, do' she ain' 'low it. 
 
 " Fust thing I know I seen a mighty likely light- 
 skinned gal standin' dyah by me, wid her hyah mos' 
 straight as white folks, an' a mighty good frock on, 
 an' a clean apron, an' her hand mos' like a lady, only 
 it brown, an' she keep on 'vidin' her eyes twix me an'

 Miss Charlotte ; when I watchin' Miss Charlotte she 
 watchin' me, an' when I steal my eye 'roun' on her 
 she noticin' Miss Charlotte ; an' presney I sort o' sidle 
 'longside her, an' I say, 'Lady, you mighty sprightly 
 to-night.' An' she say she 'bleeged to be sprightly, 
 her mistis look so good ; an' I ax her which one 
 twuz, an' she tell me, ' Dat queen one over dyah,' an' 
 I tell her dee's a king dyah too, she got her eye set 
 for ; an' when I say her mistis tryin' to set her cap for 
 Marse George, she fly up, an' say she an' her mistis 
 don' have to set dee cap tor nobody ; dee got to set 
 dee cap an' all dee clo'es for dem, an* den dee ain' 
 gwine cotch 'em cause dee ain' studyin' 'bout no 
 up-country folks whar dee ain' nobody know nuttin 
 'bout. 
 
 " Well, dat oudaciousness so aggrivate me, I lite 
 into dat nigger right dyah. I tell her she ain' been 
 nowhar 'tall ef she don' know we all ; dat we wuz de 
 bes' of quality, de ve'y top de pot ; an' den I tell her 
 'bout how gret we wuz ; how de ker'idges wuz al'ays 
 hitched up night an' day, an' niggers jes thick as 
 weeds ; an' how Unc' Torm he wared he swaller-tail 
 ev'y day when he wait on de table ; and Marse 
 George he won' wyah a coat mo'n once or twice any 
 ways, to save you life. Oh ! I sutney 'stonish dat

 nigger, 'cause I wuz teckin up for de fambly, an' I 
 meek out like dee use gold up home like urr folks 
 use wood, an' sow silver like urr folks sow wheat ; an' 
 when I got thoo dee wuz all on 'em listening an' she 
 'lowed dat Marse George he were ve'y good, sho 
 'nough, 'ef twarn for he nigger ; but I ain' tarrifyin' 
 myself none 'bout dat, 'cause I know she jes projickin, 
 an' she couldn' help bein' impident ef you wuz to 
 whup de frock off her back. 
 
 " Jes den dee struck up de dance. Dee had wheel 
 de pianer out in de hall, an' somebody say Jack For 
 ester had come cross de river, an' all on 'em say dee 
 mus' git Jack ; an' presney he come in wid he fiddle, 
 grinnin' and scrapin', 'cause he wuz a notable fiddler, 
 do' I don' think he wuz equal to we all's Tubal, an' 
 I know he couldn' tech Marse George, 'cause Marse 
 George wuz a natchel fiddler, jes like 'coons is natchel 
 pacers, an' mules an' womens is natchel kickers. How- 
 somever, he sutney jucked a jig sweet, an' when he 
 shake dat bow you couldn' help you foot switchin' 
 a leetle not ef you wuz a member of de chutch. He 
 wuz a mighty sinful man, Jack wuz, an' dat fiddle 
 had done drawed many souls to torment. 
 
 " Well, in a minute dee wuz all flyin', an' Jack he 
 wuz rockin' like boat rockin' on de water, an' he face

 right shiny, an' he teef look like ear o' corn he got in 
 he mout, an' he big foot set way out keepin' time, an' 
 Marse George he was in de lead row dyah too ; ev'y 
 chance he git he tunned Miss Charlotte 'petchel mo 
 tion, right hand across, an' cauliflower, an' croquette- 
 dee croquette plenty o' urrs, but I notice dee ain' nuver 
 fail to tun one nurr, an' ev'y tun he gin she wrappin' 
 de chain roun' him. Once when dee wuz ' prominadin- 
 all ' down we all's een o' de hall, as he tunned her some 
 body step on her dress an' to' it. I heah de screech o' 
 de silk, an' Nancy say, ' O Lord ! ' den she say, ' Nem 
 mine ! now I'll git it ! ' an' dee stop for a minute for 
 Marse George to pin 't up, while turrers went on, an' 
 Marse George wuz down on he knee, an' she look 
 down on him mighty sweet out her eyes, an' say, 
 ' Hit don' meek no difference,' an' he glance up an' 
 cotch her eye, an', jes 'dout a wud, he tyah a gret 
 piece right out de silk an' slipt it in he bosom, an' 
 when he got up, he say, right low, lookin' in her eyes 
 real deep, ' I gwine wyah dis at my weddin',' an' she 
 jes look sweet as candy; an' ef Nancy ever wyah dat 
 frock I ain' see it. 
 
 " Den presney dee wuz talkin' 'bout stoppin'. De 
 ole Cun'l say hit time to have prars, an' dee wuz beg- 
 gin' him to wait a leetle while ; an' Jack Forester lay
<page 24>

 
 " Utic' Edinburg " 13 
 
 he fiddle down nigh Marse George, an' he picked 't 
 up an' drawed de bow 'cross it jes to try it, an' den 
 jes projickin' he struck dat chune 'bout ' You'll er- 
 member me.' He hadn' mo'n tech de string when 
 you couldn' heah a pin drap. Marse George he warn 
 noticin', an' he jes lay he face on de fiddle, wid he 
 eyes sort o' half shet, an' drawed her out like he'd do 
 some nights at home in dee moonlight on de gret 
 porch, tell on a sudden he looked up an' cotch Miss 
 Charlotte eye leanin' for'ards so earnest, an' all on 'em 
 list'nin', an' he stopt, an' dee all clapt dee hands, an' 
 he sudney drapt into a jig. Jack Forester ain' had to 
 play no mo' dat night. Even de ole Cun'l ketched 
 de fever, an' he stept out in de flo' in he long-tail 
 coat an' high collar, an' knocked 'em off de ' Snow- 
 bud on de Ash-bank,' an' ' Chicken in de Bread-tray,' 
 right natchel. 
 
 " Oh, he could jes plank 'em down ! 
 
 " Oh, dat wuz a Christmas like you been read 
 'bout ! An' twuz hard to tell which gittin cotch most, 
 Marse George or me ; 'cause dat nigger she jes as con- 
 fusin' as Miss Charlotte. An' she sutney wuz sp'ilt 
 dem days ; ev'y nigger on dat place got he eye on 
 her, an' she jes az oudacious an' aggravatin as jes 
 womens kin be.
<page 25>

 
 14 " Unc' Edinburg " 
 
 " Dees monsus 'ceivin critters, womens is, jes as on- 
 reliable as de hind-leg of a mule ; a man got to watch 
 'em all de time ; you kyarn break 'em like you kin 
 horses. 
 
 " Now dat off mule dyah " (indicating, by a lazy but 
 not light lash of his whip the one selected for his il 
 lustration), " dee ain' no countin' on her at all ; she go 
 'long all day, or maybe a week, jes dat easy an' soci 
 able, an' fust thing you know you ain' know nuttin she 
 done knock you brains out; dee ain' no 'pendence to 
 be placed in 'em 'tall, suh ; she jes as sweet as a kiss 
 one minute, an' next time she come out de house she 
 got her head up in de air, an' her ears backed, an' 
 goin' long switchin' herself like I ain' good 'nough for 
 her to walk on. 
 
 " ' Fox-huntin's *? ' oh, yes, suh, ev'y day mos' ; an' 
 when Marse George didn't git de tail, twuz 'cause 
 twuz a bob-tail fox you heah me ! He play de fid 
 dle for he pastime, but he fetched up in de saddle 
 dat he cradle ! 
 
 " De fust day dee went out I heah Nancy quoilin 
 'bout de tail layin' on Miss Charlotte dressin'-table 
 gittin' hyahs over ev'ything. 
 
 " One day de ladies went out too, Miss Charlotte 
 'mongst 'em, on Miss Lucy' gray myah Switchity,
<page 26>

 
 " Unc* Edinburg" 15 
 
 an' Marse George he rid Mr. Braxton's chestnut 
 Willful. 
 
 " Well, suh, he stick so close to dat gray myah, he 
 leetle mo' los' dat fox ; but, Lord ! he know what he 
 'bout he monsus 'ceivin' 'bout dat he know de way 
 de fox gwine jes as well as he know heself ; an' all 
 de time he leadin' Miss Charlotte whar she kin heah 
 de music, but he watchin' him too, jes as narrow as a 
 ole hound. So, when de fox tun de head o' de creek, 
 Marse George had Miss Charlotte on de aidge o' de 
 flat, an' he de fust man see de fox tun down on turr 
 side wid de hounds right rank after him. Dat sort o' 
 set him back, 'cause by rights de fox ought to a' double 
 an' come back dis side : he kyarn git out dat way ; 
 an' two or three gent'mens dee had see it too, an' wuz 
 jes layin de horses to de groun' to git roun' fust, 'cause 
 de creek wuz heap too wide to jump, an' wuz 'way over 
 you head, an hit cold as Christmas, sho 'nough ; well, 
 suh, when dee tunned, Mr. Clarke he wuz in de lead 
 (he wuz ridin' for Miss Charlotte too), an' hit fyah set 
 Marse George on fire ; he ain' said but one wud, 
 'Wait,' an' jes set de chestnut's head straight for de 
 creek, whar de fox comin' wid he hyah up on he back, 
 an' de dogs ravlin mos' on him. 
 
 " De ladies screamed, an' some de gent'mens hoi-
<page 27>

 
 16 " Unc Edinburg" 
 
 lered for him to come back, but he ain' mind ; he 
 went 'cross dat flat like a wild-duck ; an' when he 
 retch de water he horse tried to flinch, but dat hand 
 on de bridle, an' dem rowels in he side, an' he 'bleeged 
 to teck it. 
 
 " Lord ! suh, sich a screech as dee set up ! But he 
 wuz swimmin' for life, an' he wuz up de bank an' in 
 de middle o' de dogs time dee tetched ole Gray Jack 
 et ; an' when Mr. Clarke got dyah Marse George wuz 
 stan'in' wid ice on him, holdin' up de tail for Miss 
 Charlotte to see, turr side de creek, an' de hounds wuz 
 wallerin' all over de body, an' I don' think Mr. Clarke 
 done got up wid 'em yit. 
 
 " He cotch de fox, an' he cotch some'n else besides, 
 is my 'pinion, 'cause when de ladies went upstairs dat 
 night Miss Charlotte had to wait on de steps for a 
 glass o' water, an' couldn' nobody git it but Marse 
 George ; an' den when she tell him good-night over 
 de banisters, he couldn' say it good enough ; he got 
 to kiss her hand ; an' she ain' do nuttin but jes peep 
 upstairs ef anybody dyah lookin'; an' when I come 
 thoo de do' she juck her hand 'way an' run upstairs 
 jes as farst as she could. Marse George look at me 
 sort o' laughin', an' say : ' Confound you ! Nancy 
 couldn' been very good to you.' An' I say, ' She le'

 me squench my thirst a leetle kissin' her hand ; ' an' 
 he sort o' laugh an' tell me to keep my mouf shet. 
 
 " But dat ain' de on'y time I come on 'em. Dee 
 al'ays gittin' corndered ; an' de evenin' befo' we come 
 'way I wuz gwine in thoo de conservity, an' dyah dee 
 wuz sort o' hide 'way. Miss Charlotte she wuz settin' 
 down, an' Marse George he wuz leanin' over her, got 
 her hand to he face, talkin' right low an' lookin' right 
 sweet, an' she ain' say nutttn ; an' presney he drapt on 
 one knee by her, an' slip he arm roun' her, an' try to 
 look in her eyes, an' she so 'shamed to look at him 
 she got to hide her face on he shoulder, an' I slipt out. 
 
 " We come 'way next mornin'. When marster 
 heah 'bout it he didn' teck to de notion at all, 'cause 
 her pa dat is, he warn' her own pa, 'cause he had 
 married her ma when she wuz a widder after Miss 
 Charlotte pa died an' he politics warn' same as ourn. 
 ' Why, you kin never stand him, suh,' he said to 
 Marse George. ' We won't mix any mo'n fire and 
 water ; you ought to have found that out at college ; 
 dat fellow Darker is his son.' 
 
 " Marse George he say he know dat ; but he on'y 
 de step-brurr of de young lady, an' ain' got a drap o' 
 her blood in he veins, an' he didn' know it when he 
 meet her, an' anyhow hit wouldn' meek any diffence ;

 an, when de mistis see how sot Marse George is on it 
 she teck he side, an' dat fix it ; 'cause when ole mis 
 tis warn marster to do a thing, hit jes good as done. 
 I don' keer how much he rar roun' an' say he ain' 
 gwine do it, you jes well go 'long an' put on you hat ; 
 you gwine see him presney doin' it jes peaceable as a 
 lamb. She tun him jes like she got bline-bridle on 
 him, an' he ain' nuver know it. 
 
 " So she got him jes straight as a string. An' when 
 de time come for Marse George to go, marster he mo' 
 consarned 'bout it 'n Marse George ; he ain' say nut- 
 tin 'bout it befo' ; but now he walkin' roun' an' roun' 
 axin mistis mo' questions 'bout he cloes an' he horse 
 an' all ; an' dat mornin' he gi' him he two Sunday 
 razors, an' gi' me a pyah o' boots an' a beaver hat, 
 'cause I wuz gwine wid him to kyar he portmanteau, 
 an' git he shavin' water, sence marster say ef he wuz 
 gwine marry a Locofoco, he at least must go like a 
 gent'man ; an' me an' Marse George had done settle 
 it 'twixt us, cause we al'ays set bofe we traps on de 
 same hyah parf. 
 
 " Well, we got 'em. When I ax dat gal out on 
 de wood-pile dat night, she say bein' as her mistis 
 gwine own me, an' we bofe got to be in de same es

 shet o' me ; an' den I clamp her. Oh, she wuz a 
 beauty ! " 
 
 A gesture and guffaw completed the recital of his 
 conquest. 
 
 " Yes, suh, we got 'em sho ! " he said, presently. 
 " Dee couldn' persist us ; we crowd 'em into de fence 
 an' run 'em off dee foots. 
 
 " Den come de 'gagement; an' ev'ything wuz smooth 
 as silk. Marse George an' me wuz ridin' over dyah 
 constant, on'y we nuver did git over bein' skeered 
 when we wuz ridin' up dat turpentine road facin' all 
 dem winders. Hit 'pears like ev'ybody in de wull 
 'mos' wuz lookin' at us. 
 
 " One evenin' Marse George say, ' Edinburg, d'you 
 ever see as many winders p'intin' one way in you' life *? 
 When I git a house,' he say, ' I gwine have all de 
 winders lookin' turr way.' 
 
 " But dat evenin' when I see Miss Charlotte come 
 walkin' out de gret parlor wid her hyah sort o' rum 
 pled over her face, an' some yaller roses on her bres, an' 
 her gret eyes so soft an' sweet, an' Marse George walk- 
 in' 'long hinst her, so peaceable, like she got chain 
 'roun' him, I say, ' Or or, winders ain' nuttin.' 
 
 " Oh, twuz jes like holiday all de time ! An' den 
 Miss Charlotte come over to see mistis, an' of co'se

 she bring her maid wid her, 'cause she 'bleeged to 
 have her maid, you know, an' dat wuz de bes' of all. 
 
 " Dat evenin', bout sunset, dee come drivin' up in 
 de big ker'idge, wid de gret hyah trunk stropped on 
 de seat behind, an' Nancy she settin' by Billy, an' 
 Marse George settin' inside by he rose-bud, 'cause he 
 had done gone down to bring her up ; an' marster he 
 done been drest in he blue coat an' yallow westket 
 ever sence dinner, an' walkin' roun', watchin' up de 
 road all de time, an' tellin' de mistis he reckon dee 
 ain' comin', an ole mistis she try to pacify him, an' 
 she come out presney drest, an' rustlin' in her stiff 
 black silk an' all ; an' when de ker'idge come in sight, 
 ev'ybody wuz runnin' ; an' when dee draw up to de 
 do', Marse George he help her out an' in'duce her to 
 marster an' ole mistis; an' marster he start to meek 
 her a gret bow, an' she jes put up her mouf like a 
 little gal to be kissed, an' dat got him. An' mistis 
 teck her right in her arms an' kiss her twice, an' de 
 servants dee wuz all peepin' an' grinnin'. 
 
 " Ev'ywhar you tun you see a nigger teef, 'cause 
 dee all warn see de young mistis whar good 'nough 
 for Marse George.

 George. Hi ! dee warn pull de house down an' buil' 
 it over for her ! An' ev'y han' on de place he peepin' 
 to try to git a look at he young mistis whar he gwine 
 b'longst to. One evenin' dee all on 'em come roun' 
 de porch an' send for Marse George, an' when he 
 come out, Charley Brown (he al'ays de speaker, 'cause 
 he got so much mouf, kin' talk pretty as white folks), 
 he say dee warn interduce to de young mistis, an' pay 
 dee bespects to her; an' presney Marse George lead 
 her out on de porch laughin' at her, wid her face jes 
 rosy as a wine-sop apple, an' she meek 'em a beauti 
 ful bow' an' speak to 'em ev'y one, Marse George 
 namin' de names ; an' Charley Brown he meek her a 
 pretty speech, an' tell her we mighty proud to own 
 her ; an' one o' dem impident gals ax her to gin her 
 dat white frock when she git married ; an' when she 
 say, ' Well, what am I goin' wear *? ' Sally say, ' Lord, 
 honey, Marse George gwine dress you in pure gol' ! ' 
 an' she look up at him wid sparks flashin' out her 
 eyes, while he look like dat ain' good 'nough for her. 
 An' so twuz, when she went 'way, Sally Marshall got 
 dat frock, an' proud on it I tell you.

 when she go to ride in evenin' wid him, de ain' no 
 horse-block good 'nough for her ! Marse George got 
 to have her step in he hand ; an' when dee out walkin' 
 he got de umbrellar holdin' 't over her all de time, he 
 so feared de sun'll kiss her; an' dee walk so slow 
 down dem walks in de shade you got to sight 'em by 
 a tree to tell ef dee movin' 'tall. She use' to look like 
 she used to it too, I tell you, 'cause she wuz quality, 
 one de white-skinned ones; an' she'd set in dem big 
 cheers, wid her little foots on de cricket whar Marse 
 George al'ays set for her, he so feared dee'd tech de 
 groun', jes like she on her throne ; an' ole marster he'd 
 watch her 'mos' edmirin as Marse George ; an' when 
 she went 'way hit sutney wuz lonesome. Hit look 
 like daylight gone wid her. I don' know which I 
 miss mos', Miss Charlotte or Nancy. 
 
 " Den Marse George wuz 'lected to de Legislature, 
 an' ole Jedge Darker run for de Senator, an' Marse 
 George vote gin him and beat him. An' dat com 
 mence de fuss; an' den dat man gi' me de whuppin, 
 an' dat breck 'tup and breck he heart. 
 
 " You see, after Marse George wuz 'lected ('Lec

 den, an' dee took dee dram, an' vote out loud, like 
 gent'mens) well, arter Marse George was 'lected, de 
 parties wuz jes as even balanced as stilyuds, an' wen 
 dee ax Marse George who wuz to be de Senator, he 
 vote for de Whig, 'ginst de old jedge, an' dat beat 
 him, of co'se. An' dee ain' got sense to know he 
 'bleeged to vote wid he politics. Dat he sprinciple ; 
 he kyarn vote for Locofoco, I don' keer ef he is Miss 
 Charlotte pa, much less her step-pa. Of co'se de ole 
 jedge ain' speak to him arter dat, nur is Marse George 
 ax him to. But who dat g'wine s'pose women-folks 
 got to put dee mouf in too? Miss Charlotte she write 
 Marse George a letter dat pester him mightily ; he 
 set up all night answerin' dat letter, an' he mighty 
 solemn, I tell you. An' I wuz gettin' right grewjou- 
 some myself, 'cause I studyin' 'bout dat gal down 
 dyah whar I done gi' my wud to, an' when dee ain' 
 no letters come torectly hit hard to tell which one de 
 anxiouser, me or Marse George. Den presney I so 
 'straughted 'long o' it I ax Aunt Haly 'bouten it : 
 (She know all sich things, 'cause she 'mos' a hunderd 
 years ole, an' seed evil speerits, an' got skoripins up 
 her chimley, an' knowed conjure) ; an' she ax me what 
 wuz de signication, an' I tell her I ain' able nuther to

 when I sleep jes as natchel as ef I see her sho' 'nough. 
 An' she say I done conjured ; dat de gal done tricked 
 me. 
 
 " Oh, Gord ! dat skeered me ! 
 
 " You white folks, marster, don' b'lieve nuttin like 
 dat ; y' all got too much sense, 'cause y' all kin read ; 
 but niggers dee ain' know no better, an' I sutney wuz 
 skeered, 'cause Aunt Haly say my coffin done sea 
 soned, de planks up de chimley. 
 
 " Well, I got so bad Marse George ax me 'bout it, 
 an' he sort o' laugh an' sort o' cuss, an' he tell Aunt 
 Haly ef she don' stop dat foolishness skeerin' me he'll 
 sell her an' tyah her ole skoripin house down. Well, 
 co'se he jes talkin', an' he ax me next day how'd I 
 like to go an' see my sweetheart. Gord ! suh, I got 
 well torectly. So I set off next evenin', feelin' jes big 
 as ole marster, wid my pass in my pocket, which I 
 warn' to show nobody 'douten I 'bleeged to, 'cause 
 Marse George didn't warn nobody to know he le' me 
 go. An' den dat rascallion teck de shut off my back. 
 But ef Marse George didn' pay him de wuth o' it ! 
 
 " I done git 'long so good, too.

 hyah all done ontwist, an' breshed out mighty fine, 
 an' a clean ap'on wid fringe on it, meek in' out she 
 so s'prised to see me (whar wuz all a lie, 'cause some 
 on 'em done notify her I dyah), an' she say, ' Hi ! what 
 dis black nigger doin' heah *? ' 
 
 "An' I say, ' Who you callin' nigger, you impident, 
 kercumber-faced thing, you *? ' Den we shake hands, 
 an' I tell her Marse George done set me free dat I 
 done buy myself; dat's de lie I done lay off to tell 
 her. 
 
 "An' when I tole her dat, she bust out laughin', 
 an' say, well, I better go 'long 'way, den, dat she don' 
 warn no free nigger to be comp'ny for her.' Dat sort 
 o' set me back, an' I tell her she kickin' 'fo' she 
 spurred, dat I ain' got her in my mine ; I got a nurr 
 gal at home whar grievin' 'bout me dat ve'y minute. 
 An' after I tell her all sich lies as dat presney she ax 
 me ain' I hongry ; an' ef dat nigger didn' git her mam

 an' fat bacon, tell I couldn' put a nurr moufful nowhar

 sweet as honey. Next mornin', do', she done sort o'

 tunned some, an' ain' so sweet. You know how milk 
 gits sort o' bonny-clabberish *? An' when she see me 
 she 'gin to 'buse me say I jes' tryin' to fool her, an' 
 all de time got nurr wife at home, or gittin' ready to 
 git one, for all she know, an' she ain' know wherr 
 Marse George ain' jes 'ceivin' as I is ; an' nem mine, 
 she got plenty warn marry her ; an' as to Miss Char 
 lotte, she got de whole wull ; Mr. Darker he ain' got 
 nobody in he way now, dat he deah all de time, an' 
 ain' gwine West no mo'. Well, dat aggrivate me so 
 I tell her ef she say dat 'bout Marse George I gwine 
 knock her ; an' wid dat she got so oudacious I meek 
 out I gwine 'way, an' lef ' her, an' went up todes de 
 barn ; an' up dyah, fust thing I know, I come across 
 dat ar man Mr. Darker. Soon as he see me he begin 
 to cuss me, an' he ax me what I doin' on dat land, an' 
 I tell him 'Nuttin'.' An' he say, well, he gwine gi' 
 me some'n ; he gwine teach me to come prowlin' round 
 gent'men's houses. An' he meek me go in de barn 
 an' teck off my shut, an' he beat me wid he whup tell 
 de blood run out my back. He sutney did beat me 
 scandalous, 'cause he done hate me an' Marse George 
 ever since we wuz at college togurr. An' den he say : 
 ' Now you git right off dis land. Ef either you or 
 you marster ever put you foot on it, you'll git de

 same thing agin.' An' I tell you, Edinburg he come 
 way, 'cause he sutney had worry me. I ain' stop to 
 see Nancy or nobody; I jes come 'long, shakin' de 
 dust, I tell you. An' as I come 'long de road I pass 
 Miss Charlotte walkin' on de lawn by herself, an' she 
 call me : ' Why, hi ! ain' dat Edinburgh ' 
 
 " She look so sweet, an' her voice soun' so cool, I 
 say, ' Yes'm ; how you do, missis *? ' An' she say, 
 she ve'y well, an' how I been, an' whar I gwine ? I 
 tell her I ain' feelin' so well, dat I gwine home. ' Hi ! ' 
 she say, ' is anybody treat you bad *? ' An' I tell her, 
 ' Yes'm'. An' she say, ' Oh ! Nancy don' mean nuttin 
 by dat ; dat you mus'n mine what womens say, an' 
 do, 'cause dee feel sorry for it next minute; an' some 
 times dee kyarn help it, or maybe hit you fault; an' 
 anyhow, you ought to be willin' to overlook it ; an' I 
 better go back an' wait till to-morrow ef ef I ain' 
 'bleeged to git home to-day.' 
 
 " She got mighty mixed up in de een part o' dat, 
 an' she looked mighty anxious 'bout me an' Nancy; 
 an' I tell her, ' No'm, I 'bleeged to git home.' 
 
 " Well, when I got home Marse George he warn

 " Gord ! I nuver see a man in sich a rage. He call 
 me in de office an' meek me teck off my shut, an' he 
 fyah bust out cryin'. He walked up an' down dat 
 office like a caged lion. Ef he had got he hand on 
 Mr. Darker den, he'd 'a kilt him, sho ! 
 
 " He wuz most 'stracted. I don't know what he'd 
 been ef I'd tell him what Nancy tell me. He call for 
 Peter to get he horse torectly, an' he tell me to go an' 
 git some'n from mammy to put on my back, an' to go 
 to bed torectly, an' not to say nuttin to nobody, but 
 to tell he pa he'd be away for two days, maybe ; an' 
 den he got on Reveller an' galloped 'way hard as he 
 could, wid he jaw set farst, an' he heaviest whup 
 clamped in he hand. Gord ! I wuz most hopin' he 
 wouldn' meet dat man, 'cause I feared ef he did he'd 
 kill him ; an' he would, sho, ef he had meet him 
 right den ; dee say he leetle mo' did when he fine him 
 next day, an' he had done been ridin' den all night; 
 he cotch him at a sto' on de road, an' dee say he 
 leetle mo' cut him all to pieces ; he drawed a weepin 
 on Marse George, but Marse George wrench it out 
 he hand an' flung it over de fence ; an' when dee got 
 him 'way he had weared he whup out on him ; an' he 
 got dem whelps on him now, ef he ain' dead. Yes, 
 suh, he ain' let nobody else do dat he ain' do heself, sho!

 " Dat done de business ! 
 
 " He sont Marse George a challenge, but Marse 
 George sont him wud he'll cowhide him agin ef he ever 
 heah any mo' from him, an' he 'ain't. Dat perrify 
 him, so he shet he mouf. Den come he ring an' all 
 he pictures an' things back a gret box on 'em', and 
 not a wud wid 'em. Marse George, I think he know'd 
 dee wuz comin', but dat ain' keep it from huttin him, 
 'cause he done been 'gaged to Miss Charlotte, an' got 
 he mine riveted to her ; an' do' befo' dat dee had stop 
 writin', an' a riff done git 'twixt 'em, he ain' satisfied in 
 he mine dat she ain't gwine 'pologizee I know by 
 Nancy ; but now he got de confirmation dat he done 
 for good, an' dat de gret gulf fixed 'twix him an' 
 Aberham bosom. An', Gord, suh, twuz torment, sho 
 'nough ! He ain' say nuttin 'bout it, but I see de 
 light done pass from him, an' de darkness done wrap 
 him up in it. In a leetle while you wouldn' a knowed 
 him. 
 
 " Den ole mistis died. 
 
 "B'lieve me, ole marster he 'most much hut by 
 Miss Charlotte as Marse George. He meek a 'tempt 
 to buy Nancy for me, so I find out arterward, an' 
 write Jedge Darker he'll pay him anything he'll ax for 
 her, but he letter wuz sont back 'dout any answer.

 He sutney was mad 'bout it he say he'd horsewhip 
 him as Marse George did dat urr young puppy, but 
 ole mistis wouldn' le' him do nuttin, and den he grieve 
 heself to death. You see he mighty ole, anyways. 
 He nuver got over ole mistis' death. She had been 
 failin' a long time, an* he ain' tarry long 'hinst her; 
 hit sort o' like breckin up a holler de ole 'coon goes 
 'way soon arter dat ; an' marster nuver could pin he 
 own collar or buckle he own stock mistis she al'ays 
 do dat ; an' do' Marse George do de bes' he kin, an' 
 mighty willin', he kyarn handle pin like a woman; he 
 hand tremble like a p'inter dog; an' anyways he ain' 
 ole mistis. So ole marster toiler her dat next fall, 
 when dee wuz gittin in de corn, an' Marse George he 
 ain' got nobody in de wull left ; he all alone in dat 
 gret house, an' I wonder sometimes he ain' die too, 
 'cause he sutney wuz fond o' old marster. 
 
 "When ole mistis wuz dyin', she tell him to be 
 good to ole marster, an' patient wid him, 'cause he 
 ain' got nobody but him now (ole marster he had jes 
 step out de room to cry) ; an' Marse George he lean 
 over her an' kiss her an' promise her faithful he would. 
 An' he sutney wuz tender wid him as a woman ; an' 
 when ole marster die, he set by him an' hoi' he hand 
 an' kiss him sort, like he wuz ole mistis.
<page 46>

 
 " Unc' Edinburg" 35 
 
 " But, Gord ! twuz lonesome arter dat, an' Marse 
 George eyes look wistful, like he al'ays lookin' far 
 'way. 
 
 " Aunt Haly say he see harnts whar walk 'bout in 
 de gret house. She say dee walk dyah constant of 
 nights sence ole marster done alterate de rooms from 
 what dee wuz when he gran'pa buil' 'em, an' dat dee 
 huntin' for dee ole chambers an' kyarn git no rest 
 'cause dee kyarn fine 'em. I don't know how dat wuz. 
 I know Marse George he used to walk about heself 
 mightily of nights. All night long, all night long, I'd 
 heah him tell de chickens crowin' dee second crow, 
 an' some mornin's I'd go dyah an' he ain' even rum 
 ple de bed. I thought sho he wuz gwine die, but I 
 suppose he done 'arn he days to be long in de land, 
 an' dat save him. But hit sutney wuz lonesome, an' 
 he nuver went off de plantation, an' he got older an' 
 older, tell we all thought he wuz gwine die. 
 
 " An' one day come jes befo' Christmas, 'bout nigh 
 two year arfter marster die, Mr. Braxton ride up to 
 de do'. He had done come to teck Marse George 
 home to spen' Christmas wid him. Marse George 
 warn git out it, but Mr. Braxton won' teck no disap- 
 p'intment ; he say he gwine baptize he boy, an' he 
 done name him after Marse George (he had marry

 36 " Unc Edinburg'' 
 
 Marse George cousin, Miss Peggy Carter, an' he vite 
 Marse George to de weddin', but he wouldn' go, do' 
 I sutney did want him to go, 'cause I heah Miss Char 
 lotte was nominated to marry Mr. Darker, an' I warn 
 know what done 'come o' dat bright-skinned nigger 
 gal whar I used to know down dyah) ; an' he say 
 Marse George got to come an' stan' for him, an' gi' 
 him a silver cup an' a gol' rattle. So Marse George 
 he finally promise to come an' spend Christmas Day, 
 an' Mr. Braxton went 'way next mornin', an' den hit 
 tun in an' rain so I feared we couldn' go, but hit cler 
 offde day befo' Christmas Eve an' tun cold. Well, 
 suh, we ain' been nowhar for so long I wuz skittish as 
 a young filly ; an' den you know twuz de same ole 
 place. 
 
 " We didn' git dyah till supper-time, an' twuz a 
 good one too, 'cause seventy miles dat cold a weather 
 hit whet a man's honger jes like a whetstone. 
 
 " Dee sutney wuz glad to see we all. We rid 
 roun' by de back yard to gi' Billy de horses, an' we 
 see dee wuz havin' gret fixin's ; an' den we went to de 
 house, jest as some o' de folks run in an' tell 'em we 
 wuz come. When Marse George stept in de hall, 
 dee all clustered roun' him like dee gwine hug him, 
 dee faces fyah dimplin' wid pleasure, an' Miss Peggy

 " Dee tell me in de kitchen dat dee wuz been 
 'spectin' of Miss Charlotte over to spend Christmas 
 too, but de river wuz so high dee s'pose dee couldn'

 " Well, after supper de niggers had a dance. Hit

 an' some o' ole mistis's best damas' tablecloths, an'

 mighty fond o' Marse George ; so I slip into de car

 " Well, presny we come out, cause Nancy warn

 An' she say dat's all a lie she tell me dat day 'bout

 Nancy say Miss Charlotte nuver could abide him ; he

 Miss Charlotte kyarn do nuttin but cry 'bout it, an'

 George, an' done 'stroy he lite ; an' she nuver keer 
 'bout nobody else sep Marse George, Nancy say. 
 Mr. Clarke he hangin' on, but Miss Charlotte she 
 done tell him pintedly she ain' nuver gwine marry no 
 body. An' dee jes done come, she say, 'cause dee 
 had to go 'way roun by de rope ferry 'long o' de river 
 bein' so high, an' dee ain' know tell dee done git out

 " Den I tell her all 'bout Marse George, 'cause I

 an' ef he warn' natchelly layin' hit down ! he wuz up

 dat cold night, an' jes as I got to de do' Marse George 
 an' Mr. Braxton come out, an' I know torectly Marse 
 George wuz gwine 'way. I seen he face by de light 
 o' de lantern, an' twuz set jes rigid as a rock. 
 
 " Mr. Braxton he wuz baiggin him to stay ; he tell

 an' twill be all right. An' all de answer Marse George 
 meek wuz to swing heselt up in de saddle, an' Rev 
 eller he look like he gwine fyah 'stracted. He al'ays

 " Well, we come 'long 'way, an' Mr. Braxton an'

 " An' jes 'fo' I started I got one o' de mens to hoi'

 dyah Nancy wuz. An' she say Miss Charlotte up- 
 steairs cryin' right now, 'cause she think Marse George

 on I better go back. I ax him whar he gwine, an' he

 wuz mighty skeered, but me an' Marse George wuz 
 boys togerr ; an' he plunged right in, an' I after him. 
 
 " Gord ! twuz cold as ice ; an' we hadn' got in 
 befo' bofe horses wuz swimmin' for life. He holler 
 to me to byah de myah head up de stream ; an' I did 
 try, but what's a nigger to dat water ! Hit jes pick me 
 up an' dash me down like I ain' no mo'n a chip, an' 
 de fust thing I know I gwine down de stream like a 
 piece of bark, an' water washin' all over me. I knowed 
 den I gone, an' I hollered for Marse George for help. 
 I heah him answer me not to git skeered, but to hold 
 on ; but de myah wuz lungin' an' de water wuz all 
 over me like ice, an' den I washed off de myah back, 
 an' got drownded. 
 
 " I 'member comin' up an' hollerin' agin for help, 
 but I know den' 'tain' no use, dee ain' no help den, 
 an' I got to pray to Gord, an' den some'n hit me an' I 
 went down agin, an'- de next thing I know I wuz 
 in de bed, an' I heah 'em talkin' 'bout wherr I dead 
 or not, an' I ain' know myself tell I taste de whiskey 
 dee po'rin' down my jugular. 
 
 " An' den dee tell me 'bout how when I hollered 
 Marse George tun back an' struck out for me for 
 life, an' how jes as I went down de last time he cotch

 bank curve, an' dyah de current wuz so rapid hit yuck 
 him off Reveller back, but he helt on to de reins tell 
 de horse lunge so he hit him wid he fo' foot an' breck 
 he collar-bone, an' den he had to let him go, an' jes 
 helt on to me ; an' den we wash up agin de bank an' 
 cotch in a tree, an' de mens got dyah quick as dee 
 could, an' when dee retched us Marse George wuz 
 holdin' on to me, an' had he arm wropped roun' a 
 limb, an' we wuz lodged in de crotch, an' bofe jes as 
 dead as a nail ; an' de myah she got out, but Reveller 
 he wuz drownded, wid his foot cotch in de rein an' 
 de saddle tunned onder he side ; an' dee ain' know 
 wherr Marse George ain' dead too, 'cause he not only 
 drownded, but he let' arm broke up nigh de shoulder. 
 " An' dee say Miss Charlotte she 'mos' 'stracted ; 
 dat de fust thing anybody know 'bout it wuz when 
 some de servants bust in de hall an' holler, an' say 
 Marse George an' me bofe done washed 'way an'

 an' when dee bring her to she 'low to Miss Lucy dat

 mens wuz totin' him in de house, an' wuz shufflin' de 
 feets not to meek no noige, an' a little piece o' wet

 down agin ; an' some on 'em say she sutney did keer 
 for him ; an' now when he layin' upstairs dyah dead, 
 hit too late for him ever to know it. 
 
 " Well, suh, I couldn' teck it in dat Marse George 
 and Reveller wuz dead, an' jes den somebody say 
 Marse George done comin' to an' dee gi' me so much 
 whiskey I went to sleep. 
 
 " An' next mornin' I got up an' went to Marse 
 George room, an' see him layin' dyah in de bed, wid 
 he face so white an' he eyes so tired-lookin', an' he 
 ain' know me no mo' 'n ef he nuver see me, an' I 
 couldn' stan' it ; I jes drap down on de flo' an' bust 
 out cryin'. Gord ! suh, I couldn' help it, 'cause Rev 
 eller wuz drownded, an' Marse George he wuz mos' 
 gone. 
 
 " An' he came nigher goin' yit, 'cause he had sich a 
 strain, an' been so long in de water, he heart done 
 got numbed, an' he got 'lirium, an' all de time he 
 thought he tryin' to git 'cross de river to see Miss 
 Charlotte, an' hit so high he kyarn git dyah. 
 
 " Hit sutney wuz pitiful to see him layin' dyah 
 tossin' an' pitchin', not knowin' whar he wuz, tell it 
 teck all Mr. Braxton an' me could do to keep him 
 in de bed, an' de doctors say he kyarn hoi' out much 
 longer.

 " An' all dis time Miss Charlotte she wuz gwine 
 'bout de house wid her face right white, an' Nancy 
 say she don' do nuttin all day long in her room but 
 cry an' say her pra'rs, prayin' for Marse George, 
 whar dyin' upsteairs by 'count' o' not knowin' she 
 love him, an' I tell Nancy how he honin' all de time 
 to see her, an' how he constant cravin' her name. 
 
 " Well, so twuz, tell he mos' done wyah heself 
 out ; an' jes lay dyah wid his face white as de pillow, 
 an' he gret pitiful eyes rollin' 'bout so restless, like he 
 still lookin' for her whar he all de time callin' her 
 name, an' kyarn git 'cross dat river to see. 
 
 " An' one evenin' 'bout sunset he 'peared to be 
 gwine ; he weaker'n he been at all, he ain' able to 
 scuffle no mo', an' jes layin' dyah so quiet, an' presney 
 he say, lookin' mighty wistful : 
 
 " ' Edinburg, I'm goin' to-night ; ef I don't git 
 'cross dis time, I'll gin't up.' 
 
 " Mr. Braxton wuz standin' nigh de head o' de bed, 
 an' he say, ' Well, by Gord ! he shell see her ! ' jes 
 so. An' he went out de room, an' to Miss Charlotte 
 do', an' call her, an' tell her she got to come, ef she
