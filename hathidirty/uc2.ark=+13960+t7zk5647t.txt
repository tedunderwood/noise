 HARRIET BEECHER (STOWEJ was born June 14, 
 1811, in the characteristic New England town of Litch- 
 field, Conn. Her father was the Rev. Dr. Lyman 
 Beecher, a distinguished Calvinistic divine, her mother 
 Roxanna Foote, his first wife. The little new-comer 
 was ushered into a household of happy, healthy chij- 
 dren, and found five brothers and sisters awaiting her. 
 The eldest was Catherine, born September 6, 1800. 
 Following her were two sturdy boys, William and Ed 
 ward ; then came Mary, then George, and at last Har 
 riet. Another little Harriet born three years before 
 had died when only one month old, and the fourth 
 daughter was named, in memory of this sister, Harriet 
 Elizabeth Beecher. Just two years after Harriet was 
 born, in the same month, another brother, Henry Ward, 
 

<page 23>
2 CHILDHOOD. 
 
 was welcomed to the family circle, and after him came 
 Charles, the last of Roxanna Beecher s children. 
 
 The first memorable incident of Harriet s life was the 
 death of her mother, which occurred when she was four 
 years old, and which ever afterwards remained with 
 her as the tenderest, saddest, and most sacred memory 
 of her childhood. Mrs. Stowe s recollections of her 
 mother are found in a letter to her brother Charles, af 
 terwards published in the &quot; Autobiography and Corre 
 spondence of Lyman Beecher.&quot; She says : 
 
 &quot; I was between three and four years of age when 
 &amp;lt;our mother died, and my personal recollections of her 
 .are therefore but few. But the deep interest and 
 .veneration that she inspired in all who knew her were 
 such that during all my childhood I was constantly 
 hearing her spoken of, and from one friend or another 
 some incident or anecdote of her life was constantly 
 being impressed upon me. 
 
 &quot; Mother was one of those strong, restful, yet widely 
 sympathetic natures in whom all around seemed to find 
 comfort and repose. The communion between her and 
 my father was a peculiar one. It was an intimacy 
 throughout the whole range of their being. There 
 was no human mind in whose decisions he had greater 
 confidence. Both intellectually and morally he re 
 garded her as the better and stronger portion of him 
 self, and I remember hearing him say that after her 
 death his first sensation was a sort of terror, like that 
 of a child suddenly shut out alone in the dark. 
 
 &quot;In my own childhood only two incidents of my 
 mother twinkle like rays through the darkness. One 
 was of our all running and dancing out before her 
 

<page 24>
HER MOTHER. 3 
 
 from the nursery to the sitting-room one Sabbath morn 
 ing, and her pleasant voice saying after us, Remember 
 the Sabbath day to keep it holy, children. 
 
 &quot; Another remembrance is this : mother was an en 
 thusiastic horticulturist in all the small ways that lim 
 ited means allowed. Her brother John in New York 
 had just sent her a small parcel of fine tulip-bulbs. 
 I remember rummaging these out of an obscure corner 
 of the nursery one day when she was gone out, and 
 being strongly seized with the idea that they were good 
 to eat, using all the little English I then possessed to 
 persuade my brothers that these were onions such as 
 grown people ate and would be very nice for us. So 
 we fell to and devoured the whole, and I recollect being 
 somewhat disappointed in the odd sweetish taste, and 
 thinking that onions were not so nice as I had supposed. 
 Then mother s serene face appeared at the nursery door 
 and we all ran towards her, telling with one voice of 
 our discovery and achievement. We had found a bag 
 of onions and had eaten them all up. 
 
 &quot; Also I remember that there was not even a mo 
 mentary expression of impatience, but that she sat down 
 and said, My dear children, what you have done 
 makes mamma very sorry. Those were not onions but 
 roots of beautiful flowers, and if you had let them 
 alone we should have next summer in the garden great 
 beautiful red and yellow flowers such as you never saw. 
 I remember how drooping and dispirited we all grew 
 at this picture, and how sadly we regarded the empty 
 paper bag. 
 
 &quot; Then I have a recollection of her reading aloud to 
 the children Miss Edge worth s Frank, which had just 
 

<page 25>

 come out, I believe, and was exciting a good deal of 
 attention among the educational circles of Litchfield. 
 After that came a time when every one said she was 
 sick, and I used to be permitted to go once a day into 
 her room, where she sat bolstered up in bed. I have a 
 vision of a very fair face with a bright red spot on each 
 cheek and her quiet smile. I remember dreaming one 
 night that mamma had got well, and of waking with 
 loud transports of joy that were hushed down by some 
 one who came into the room. My dream was indeed a 
 true one. She was forever well. 
 
 &quot; Then came the funeral. Henry was too little to 
 go. I can see his golden curls and little black frock 
 as he frolicked in the sun like a kitten, full of ignorant 
 
 &quot; I recollect the mourning dresses, the tears of the 
 older children, the walking to the burial-ground, and 
 somebody s speaking at the grave. Then all was closed, 
 and we little ones, to whom it was so confused, asked 
 where she was gone and would she never come back. 
 
 &quot; They told us at one time that she had been laid in 
 the ground, and at another that she had gone to heaven. 
 Thereupon Henry, putting the two things together, re 
 solved to dig through the ground and go to heaven to 
 find her ; for being discovered under sister Catherine s 
 window one morning digging with great zeal and ear 
 nestness, she called to him to know what he was doing. 
 Lifting his curly head, he answered with great sim 
 plicity, * Why, I m going to heaven to find mamma. 
 
 &quot; Although our mother s bodily presence thus disap 
 peared from our circle, I think her memory and example 
 had more influence in moulding her family, in deterring 
 

<page 26>
AUNT HARRIET FOOTE. 5 
 
 from evil and exciting to good, than the living presence 
 of many mothers. It was a memory that met us every 
 where, for every person in the town, from the highest 
 to the lowest, seemed to have been so impressed by her 
 character and life that they constantly reflected some 
 portion of it back upon us. 
 
 &quot; The passage in Uncle Tom where Augustine St. 
 Clare describes his mother s influence is a simple repro 
 duction of my own mother s influence as it has always 
 been felt in her family.&quot; 
 
 Of his deceased wife Dr. Beecher said : &quot; Few women 
 have attained to more remarkable piety. Her faith was 
 strong and her prayer prevailing. It was her wish that 
 all her sons should devote themselves to the ministry, 
 and to it she consecrated them with fervent prayer. 
 Her prayers have been heard. All her sons have been 
 converted and are now, according to her wish, min 
 isters of Christ.&quot; 
 
 Such was Roxanna Beecher, whose influence upon 
 her four-year-old daughter was strong enough to mould 
 the whole after-life of the author of &quot; Uncle Tom s 
 Cabin.&quot; After the mother s death the Litchfield home 
 was such a sad, lonely place for the child that her aunt, 
 Harriet Foote, took her away for a long visit at her 
 grandmother s at Nut Plains, near Guilford, Conn., the 
 first journey from home the little one had ever made. 
 Of this visit Mrs. Stowe herself says : 
 
 &quot; Among my earliest recollections are those of a visit 
 to Nut Plains immediately after my mother s death. 
 Aunt Harriet Foote, who was with mother during all 
 her last sickness, took me home to stay with her. At 
 the close of what seemed to me a long day s ride we 
 

<page 27>
6 CHILDHOOD. 
 
 arrived after dark at a lonely little white farmhouse, 
 and were ushered into a large parlor where a cheerful 
 wood fire was crackling. I was placed in the arms of 
 an old lady, who held me close and wept silently, a 
 thing at which I marveled, for my great loss was al 
 ready faded from my childish mind. 
 
 &quot; I remember being put to bed by my aunt in a large 
 room, on one side of which stood the bed appropriated 
 to her and me, and on the other that of my grand 
 mother. My aunt Harriet was no common character. 
 A more energetic human being never undertook the 
 education of a child. Her ideas of education were 
 those of a vigorous English woman of the old school. 
 She believed in the Church, and had she been born 
 under that regime would have believed in the king 
 stoutly, although being of the generation following the 
 Revolution she was a not less stanch supporter of the 
 Declaration of Independence. 
 
 &quot; According to her views little girls were to be taught 
 to move very gently, to speak softly and prettily, to say 
 yes ma am/ and no ma am/ never to tear their clothes, 
 to sew, to knit at regular hours, to go to church on 
 Sunday and make all the responses, and to come home 
 and be catechised. 
 
 &quot; During these catechisings she used to place my 
 little cousin Mary and myself bolt upright at her knee, 
 while black Dinah and Harry, the bound boy, were 
 ranged at a respectful distance behind us ; for Aunt 
 Harriet always impressed it upon her servants ( to order 
 themselves lowly and reverently to all their betters/ a 
 portion of the Church catechism that always pleased 
 me, particularly when applied to them, as it insured 
 

<page 28>

 their calling me Miss Harriet/ and treating me fodth a 
 degree of consideration such as I never enjoyed in the 
 more democratic circle at home. I became proficient 
 in the Church catechism, and gave my aunt great satis 
 faction by the old-fashioned gravity and steadiness with 
 which I learned to repeat it. 
 
 &quot; As my father was a Congregational minister, I be 
 lieve Aunt Harriet, though the highest of High Church 
 women, felt some scruples as to whether it was desirable 
 that my religious education should be entirely out of 
 the sphere of my birth. Therefore when this cate 
 chetical exercise was finished she would say, Now, 
 niece, you have to learn another catechism, because 
 your father is a Presbyterian minister/ - - and then she 
 would endeavor to make me commit to memory the As 
 sembly catechism. 
 
 &quot; At this lengthening of exercise I secretly mur 
 mured. I was rather pleased at the first question in 
 the Church catechism, which is certainly quite on the 
 level of any child s understanding, What is your 
 name ? It was such an easy good start, I could say 
 it so loud and clear, and I was accustomed to compare 
 it with the first question in the Primer, What is the 
 chief end of man ? as vastly more difficult for me to 
 answer. In fact, between my aunt s secret unbelief 
 and my own childish impatience of too much catechism, 
 the matter was indefinitely postponed after a few inef 
 fectual attempts, and I was overjoyed to hear her an 
 nounce privately to grandmother that she thought it 
 would be time enough for Harriet to learn the Presby 
 terian catechism when she went home.&quot; 
 
 Mingled with this superabundance of catechism and 
 

<page 31>

 plentiful needlework the child was treated to copious 
 extracts from Lowth s Isaiah, Buchanan s Researches 
 in Asia, Bishop Heber s Life, and Dr. Johnson s Works, 
 which, after her Bible and Prayer Book, were her 
 grandmother s favorite reading. Harriet does not seem 
 to have fully appreciated these ; but she did enjoy her 
 grandmother s comments upon their biblical readings. 
 Among the Evangelists especially was the old lady per 
 fectly at home, and her idea of each of the apostles was 
 so distinct and dramatic that she spoke of them as of 
 familiar acquaintances. She would, for instance, always 
 smile indulgently at Peter s remarks and say, &quot; There 
 he is again, now ; that s just like Peter. He s always 
 so ready to put in.&quot; 
 
 It must have been during this winter spent at Nut 
 Plains, amid such surroundings, that Harriet began 
 committing to memory that wonderful assortment of 
 hymns, poems, and scriptural passages from which in 
 after years she quoted so readily and effectively, for 
 her sister Catherine, in writing of her the following 
 November, says : 
 
 &quot; Harriet is a very good girl. She has been to school 
 all this summer, and has learned to read very fluently. 
 She has committed to memory twenty-seven hymns and 
 two long chapters in the Bible. She has a remarkably 
 retentive memory and will make a very good scholar.&quot; 
 
 At this time the child was five years old, and a regu 
 lar attendant at &quot; Ma am Kilbourne s &quot; school on West 
 Street, to which she walked every day hand in hand 
 with her chubby, rosy-faced, bare-footed, four-year-old 
 brother, Henry Ward. With the ability to read ger 
 minated the intense literary longing that was to be hers 
 

<page 32>

 through life. In those days but few books were spe 
 cially prepared for children, and at six years of age we 
 find the little girl hungrily searching for mental food 
 amid barrels of old sermons and pamphlets stored in a 
 corner of the garret. Here it seemed to her were some 
 thousands of the most unintelligible things. &quot; An ap 
 peal on the unlawfulness of a man marrying his wife s 
 sister &quot; turned up in every barrel she investigated, by 
 twos, or threes, or dozens, till her soul despaired of find 
 ing an end. At last her patient search was rewarded, 
 for at the very bottom of a barrel of musty sermons she 
 discovered an ancient volume of &quot; The Arabian Nights.&quot; 
 With this her fortune was made, for in these most fas 
 cinating of fairy tales the imaginative child discovered 
 a well-spring of joy that was all her own. When 
 things went astray with her, when her brothers started 
 off on long excursions, refusing to take her with them, 
 or in any other childish sorrow, she had only to curl 
 herself up in some snug corner and sail forth on her 
 bit of enchanted carpet into fairyland to forget all her 
 griefs. 
 
 In recalling her own child-life Mrs. Stowe, among 
 other things, describes her father s library, and gives a 
 vivid bit of her own experiences within its walls. She 
 says : &quot; High above all the noise of the house, this room 
 had to me the air of a refuge and a sanctuary. Its 
 walls were set round from floor to ceiling with the 
 friendly, quiet faces of books, and there stood my fa 
 ther s great writing-chair, on one arm of which lay 
 open always his Cruden s Concordance and his Bible. 
 Here I loved to retreat and niche myself down in a 
 quiet corner with my favorite books around me. I had 
 

<page 33>
10 CHILDHOOD. 
 
 a kind of sheltered feeling as I thus sat and watched 
 my father writing, turning to his books, and speaking 
 from time to time to himself in a loud, earnest whisper. 
 I vaguely felt that he was about some holy and myste 
 rious work quite beyond my little comprehension, and I 
 was careful never to disturb him by question or remark. 
 
 &quot; The books ranged around filled me too with a sol 
 emn awe. On the lower shelves were enormous folios, 
 on whose backs I spelled in black letters, 6 Lightf oot 
 Opera/ a title whereat I wondered, considering the 
 bulk of the volumes. Above these, grouped along in 
 friendly, social rows, were books of all sorts, sizes, and 
 bindings, the titles of which I had read so often that I 
 knew them by heart. There were Bell s Sermons, Bon- 
 nett s Inquiries, Bogue s Essays, Toplady on Predesti 
 nation, Boston s Fourfold State, Law s Serious Call, 
 and other works of that kind. These I looked over 
 wistfully, day after day, without even a hope of getting 
 something interesting out of them. The thought that 
 father could read and understand things like these 
 filled me with a vague awe, and I wondered if I would 
 ever be old enough to know what it was all about. 
 
 &quot; But there was one of my father s books that proved 
 a mine of wealth to me. It was a happy hour when he 
 brought home and set up in his bookcase Cotton Ma 
 ther s Magnalia, in a new edition of two volumes. 
 What wonderful stories those ! Stories too about my 
 own country. Stories that made me feel the very 
 ground I trod on to be consecrated by some special 
 dealing of God s Providence.&quot; 
 
 In continuing these reminiscences Mrs. Stowe de 
 scribes as follows her sensations upon first hearing the 
 

<page 34>

THE NEW MOTHER. 11 
 
 Declaration of Independence : &quot; I had never heard it 
 before, and even now had but a vague idea of what 
 was meant by some parts of it. Still I gathered enough 
 from the recital of the abuses and injuries that had 
 driven my nation to this course to feel myself swelling 
 with indignation, and ready with all my little mind and 
 strength to applaud the concluding passage, which 
 Colonel Talmadge rendered with resounding majesty. I 
 was as ready as any of them to pledge my life, fortune, 
 and sacred honor for such a cause. The heroic element 
 was strong in me, having come down by ordinary gen 
 eration from a long line of Puritan ancestry, and just 
 now it made me long to do something, I knew not 
 what : to fight for my country, or to make some decla 
 ration on my own account.&quot; 
 
 When Harriet was nearly six years old her father 
 married as his second wife Miss Harriet Porter of Port 
 land, Maine, and Mrs. Stowe thus describes her new 
 mother : &quot;I slept in the nursery with my two younger 
 brothers. We knew that father was gone away some 
 where on a journey and was expected home, therefore 
 the sound of a bustle in the house the more easily 
 awoke us. As father came into our room our new 
 mother followed him. She was very fair, with bright 
 blue eyes, and soft auburn hair bound round with a 
 black velvet bandeau, and to us she seemed very beau 
 tiful. 
 
 &quot;Never did stepmother make a prettier or sweeter 
 impression. The morning following her arrival we 
 looked at her with awe. She seemed to us so fair, so 
 delicate, so elegant, that we were almost afraid to go 
 near her. We must have appeared to her as rough, 
 

<page 37>
12 CHILDHOOD. 
 
 red-faced, country children, honest, obedient, and bash 
 ful. She was peculiarly dainty and neat in all her 
 ways and arrangements, and I used to feel breezy, 
 rough, and rude in her presence. 
 
 &quot; In her religion she was distinguished for a most 
 unfaltering Christ-worship. She was of a type noble 
 but severe, naturally hard, correct, exact and exacting, 
 with intense natural and moral ideality. Had it not 
 been that Doctor Payson had set up and kept before 
 her a tender, human, loving Christ, she would have 
 been only a conscientious bigot. This image, however, 
 gave softness and warmth to her religious life, and I 
 have since noticed how her Christ - enthusiasm has 
 sprung up in the hearts of all her children.&quot; 
 
 In writing to her old home of her first impressions 
 of her new one, Mrs. Beecher says : &quot; It is a very lovely 
 family, and with heartfelt gratitude I observed how 
 cheerful and healthy they were. The sentiment is 
 greatly increased, since I perceive them to be of agree 
 able habits and some of them of uncommon intellect.&quot; 
 
 This new mother proved to be indeed all that the 
 name implies to her husband s children, and never did 
 they have occasion to call her aught other than blessed. 
 
 Another year finds a new baby brother, Frederick 
 by name, added to the family. At this time too we 
 catch a characteristic glimpse of Harriet in one of her 
 sister Catherine s letters. She says : &quot; Last week we 
 interred Tom junior with funeral honors by the side of 
 old Tom of happy memory. Our Harriet is chief 
 mourner always at their funerals. She asked for what 
 she called an epithet for the gravestone of Tom junior, 
 which I gave as follows : 
 

<page 38>
AT LITCHFIELD ACADEMY. 13 
 
 &quot; Here lies our Kit, 
 Who had a fit, 
 
 And acted queer, 
 Shot with a gun, 
 Her race is run, 
 
 And she lies here.&quot; 
 
 In June, 1820, little Frederick died from scarlet fe 
 ver, and Harriet was seized with a violent attack of the 
 same dread disease ; but, after a severe struggle, re 
 covered. 
 
 Following her happy, hearty child-life, we find her 
 tramping through the woods or going on fishing excur 
 sions with her brothers, sitting thoughtfully in her 
 father s study, listening eagerly to the animated theo 
 logical discussions of the day, visiting her grandmother 
 at Nut Plains, and figuring as one of the brightest 
 scholars in the Litchfield Academy, taught by Mr. 
 John Brace and Miss Pierce. When she was eleven 
 years old her brother Edward wrote of her : &quot; Harriet 
 reads everything she can lay hands on, and sews and 
 knits diligently.&quot; 
 
 At this time she was no longer the youngest girl of 
 the family, for another sister (Isabella) had been born 
 in 1822. This event served greatly to mature her, as 
 she was intrusted with much of the care of the baby 
 out of school hours. It was not, however, allowed to 
 interfere in any way with her studies, and, under the 
 skillful direction of her beloved teachers, she seemed 
 to absorb knowledge with every sense. She herself 
 writes : &quot; Much of the training and inspiration of my 
 early days consisted not in the things that I was sup 
 posed to be studying, but in hearing, while seated un 
 noticed at my desk, the conversation of Mr. Brace with 
 

<page 39>
14 CHILDHOOD. 
 
 the older classes. There, from hour to hour, I listened 
 with eager ears to historical criticisms and discussions, 
 or to recitations in such works as Paley s Moral Phi 
 losophy, Blair s Rhetoric, Allison on Taste, all full of 
 most awakening suggestions to my thoughts. 
 
 &quot; Mr. Brace exceeded all teachers I ever knew in the 
 faculty of teaching composition. The constant excite 
 ment in which he kept the minds of his pupils, the wide 
 and varied regions of thought into which he led them, 
 formed a preparation for composition, the main requisite 
 for which is to have something which one feels inter 
 ested to say.&quot; 
 
 In her tenth year Harriet began what to her was the 
 fascinating work of writing compositions, and so rapidly 
 did she progress that at the school exhibition held when 
 she was twelve years old, hers was one of the two or 
 three essays selected to be read aloud before the august 
 assembly of visitors attracted by the occasion. 
 
 Of this event Mrs. Stowe writes : &quot;I remember well 
 the scene at that exhibition, to me so eventful. The 
 hall was crowded with all the literati of Litchfield. 
 Before them all our compositions were read aloud. 
 When mine was read I noticed that father, who was 
 sitting on high by Mr. Brace, brightened and looked 
 interested, and at the close I heard him ask, Who 
 wrote that composition ? Your daughter, sir, was the 
 answer. It was the proudest moment of my life. There 
 was no mistaking father s face when he was pleased, 
 and to have interested him was past all juvenile tri 
 umphs.&quot; 
 
 That composition has been carefully preserved, and 
 on the old yellow sheets the cramped childish hand- 
 

<page 40>
FIEST COMPOSITION. 15 
 
 writing is still distinctly legible. As the first literary 
 production of one who afterwards attained such dis 
 tinction as a writer, it is deemed of sufficient value and 
 interest to be embodied in this biography exactly as it 
 was written and read sixty-five years ago. The subject 
 was certainly a grave one to be handled by a child of 
 twelve. 
 
 CAN THE IMMORTALITY OF THE SOUL BE PROVED BY 
 THE LIGHT OF NATURE? 
 
 It has justly been concluded by the philosophers of 
 every age that &quot; The proper study of mankind is man,&quot; 
 and his nature and composition, both physical and men 
 tal, have been subjects of the most critical examination. 
 In the course of these researches many have been at a 
 loss to account for the change which takes place in the 
 body at the time of death. By some it has been at 
 tributed to the flight of its tenant, and by others to its 
 final annihilation. 
 
 The questions, &quot; What becomes of the soul at the 
 time of death ? &quot; and, if it be not annihilated, &quot; What 
 is its destiny after death ? &quot; are those which, from the 
 interest that we all feel in them, will probably engross 
 universal attention. 
 
 In pursuing these inquiries it will be necessary to 
 divest ourselves of all that knowledge which we have 
 obtained from the light which revelation has shed over 
 them, and place ourselves in the same position as the 
 philosophers of past ages when considering the same 
 subject. 
 
 The first argument -which has been advanced to 
 prove the immortality of the soul is drawn from the 
 

<page 41>
16 CHILDHOOD. 
 
 nature of the mind itself. It has (say the supporters 
 of this theory) no composition of parts, and therefore, 
 as there are no particles, is not susceptible of divisi 
 bility and cannot be acted upon by decay, and therefore 
 if it will not decay it will exist forever. 
 
 Now because the mind is not susceptible of decay 
 effected in the ordinary way by a gradual separation of 
 particles, affords no proof that that same omnipotent 
 power which created it cannot by another simple exer 
 tion of power again reduce it to nothing. The only 
 reason for belief which this argument affords is that 
 the soul cannot be acted upon by decay. But it does 
 not prove that it cannot destroy its existence. There 
 fore, for the validity of this argument, it must either 
 be proved that the &quot; Creator &quot; has not the power to 
 destroy it, or that he has not the will ; but as neither 
 of these can be established, our immortality is left de 
 pendent on the pleasure of the Creator. But it is said 
 that it is evident that the Creator designed the soul for 
 immortality, or he would never have created it so essen 
 tially different from the body, for had they both been 
 designed for the same end they would both have been 
 created alike, as there would have been no object in 
 forming them otherwise. This only proves that the 
 soul and body had not the same destinations. Now of 
 what these destinations are we know nothing, and after 
 much useless reasoning we return where we began, our 
 argument depending upon the good pleasure of the 
 Creator. 
 
 And here it is said that a being of such infinite wis 
 dom and benevolence as that of which the Creator is 
 possessed would not have formed man with such vast 
 

<page 42>
FIRST COMPOSITION. 17 
 
 capacities and boundless desires, and would have given 
 him no opportunity for exercising them. 
 
 In order to establish the validity of this argument 
 it is necessary to prove by the light of Nature that the 
 Creator is benevolent, which, being impracticable, is of 
 itself sufficient to render the argument invalid. 
 
 But the argument proceeds upon the supposition that 
 to destroy the soul would be unwise. Now this is ar 
 raigning the &quot; All- wise &quot; before the tribunal of his sub 
 jects to answer for the mistakes in his government. 
 Can we look into the council of the &quot; Unsearchable &quot; 
 and see what means are made to answer their ends? 
 We do not know but the destruction of the soul may, 
 in the government of God, be made to answer such a 
 purpose that its existence would be contrary to the dic 
 tates of wisdom. 
 
 The great desire of the soul for immortality, its secret, 
 innate horror of annihilation, has been brought to prove 
 its immortality. But do we always find this horror or 
 this desire? Is it not much more evident that the 
 great majority of mankind have no such dread at all ? 
 True that there is a strong feeling of horror excited 
 by the idea of perishing from the earth and being for 
 gotten, of losing all those honors and all that fame 
 awaited them. Many feel this secret horror when they 
 look down upon the vale of futurity and reflect that 
 though now the idols of the world, soon all which will 
 be left them will be the common portion of mankind - 
 oblivion ! But this dread does not arise from any idea 
 of their destiny beyond the tomb, and even were this 
 true, it would afford no proof that the mind would 
 exist forever, merely from its strong desires. For it 
 

<page 43>
18 CHILDHOOD. 
 
 might with as much correctness be argued that the 
 body will exist forever because we have a great dread 
 of dying, and upon this principle nothing which we 
 strongly desire would ever be withheld from us, and no 
 evil that we greatly dread will ever come upon us, a 
 principle evidently false. 
 
 Again, it has been said that the constant progres 
 sion of the powers of the mind affords another proof 
 of its immortality. Concerning this, Addison remarks, 
 &quot; Were a human soul ever thus at a stand in her ac 
 quirements, were her faculties to be full blown and in 
 capable of further enlargement, I could imagine that 
 she might fall away insensibly and drop at once into a 
 state of annihilation. But can we believe a thinking 
 being that is in a perpetual progress of improvement, 
 and traveling on from perfection to perfection after 
 having just looked abroad into the works of her Crea 
 tor and made a few discoveries of his infinite wisdom 
 and goodness, must perish at her first setting out and 
 in the very beginning of her inquiries ? &quot; 
 
 In answer to this it may be said that the soul is not 
 always progressing in her powers. Is it not rather a 
 subject of general remark that those brilliant talents 
 which in youth expand, in manhood become stationary, 
 and in old age gradually sink to decay? Till when 
 the ancient man descends to the tomb scarce a wreck of 
 that once powerful mind remains. 
 
 Who, but upon reading the history of England, does 
 not look with awe upon the effects produced by the 
 talents of her Elizabeth? Who but admires that un 
 daunted firmness in time of peace and that profound 
 depth of policy which she displayed in the cabinet? 
 

<page 44>
FIRST COMPOSITION. 19 
 
 Yet behold the tragical end of this learned, this politic 
 princess ! Behold the triumphs of age and sickness 
 over her once powerful talents, and say not that the 
 faculties of man are always progressing in then 1 powers. 
 
 From the activity of the mind at the hour of death 
 has also been deduced its immortality. But it is not 
 true that the mind is always active at the time of death. 
 We find recorded in history numberless instances of 
 those talents, which were once adequate to the govern 
 ment of a nation, being so weakened and palsied by 
 the touch of sickness as scarcely to tell to beholders 
 what they once were. The talents of the statesman, 
 the wisdom of the sage, the courage and might of the 
 warrior, are instantly destroyed by it, and all that re 
 mains of them is the waste of idiocy or the madness of 
 insanity. 
 
 Some minds there are who at the time of death retain 
 their faculties though much impaired, and if the argu 
 ment be valid these are the only cases where im 
 mortality is conferred. Again, it is urged that the 
 inequality of rewards and punishments in this world 
 demand another in which virtue may be rewarded and 
 vice punished. This argument, in the first place, takes 
 for its foundation that by the light of nature the dis 
 tinction between virtue and vice can be discovered. By 
 some this is absolutely disbelieved, and by all considered 
 as extremely doubtful. And, secondly, it puts the Cre 
 ator under an obligation to reward and punish the ac 
 tions of his creatures. No such obligation exists, and 
 therefore the argument cannot be valid. And this sup 
 poses the Creator to be a being of justice, which can 
 not by the light of nature be proved, and as the whole 
 

<page 45>
20 CHILDHOOD. 
 
 argument rests upon this foundation it certainly cannot 
 be correct. 
 
 This argument also directly impeaches the wisdom of 
 the Creator, for the sense of it is this, that, foras 
 much as he was not able to manage his government in 
 this world, he must have another in which to rectify 
 the mistakes and oversights of this, and what an idea 
 would this give us of our All-wise Creator? 
 
 It is also said that all nations have some conceptions 
 of a future state, that the ancient Greeks and Romans 
 believed in it, that no nation has been found but have 
 possessed some idea of a future state of existence. But 
 their belief arose more from the fact that they wished 
 it to be so than from any real ground of belief ; for 
 arguments appear much more plausible when the mind 
 wishes to be convinced. But it is said that every na 
 tion, however circumstanced, possess some idea of a 
 future state. For this we may account by the fact that 
 it was handed down by tradition from the time of the 
 flood. From all these arguments, which, however plausi 
 ble at first sight, are found to be futile, may be argued 
 the necessity of a revelation. Without it, the destiny 
 of the noblest of the works of God would have been 
 left in obscurity. Never till the blessed light of the 
 Gospel dawned on the borders of the pit, and the her 
 alds of the Cross proclaimed &quot; Peace on earth and good 
 will to men,&quot; was it that bewildered and misled man 
 was enabled to trace his celestial origin and glorious 
 destiny. 
 
 The sun of the Gospel has dispelled the darkness 
 that has rested on objects beyond the tomb. In the 
 Gospel man learned that when the dust returned to 
 

<page 46>
GOES TO HARTFORD. 21 
 
 dust the spirit fled to the God who gave it. He there 
 found that though man has lost the image of his divine 
 Creator, he is still destined, after this earthly house of 
 his tabernacle is dissolved, to an inheritance incorrupti 
 ble, undefiled, and that fadeth not away, to a house not 
 made with hands, eternal in the heavens. 
 
 Soon after the writing of this remarkable composi 
 tion, Harriet s child-life in Litchfield came to an end, 
 for that same year she went to Hartford to pursue her 
 studies in a school which had been recently established 
 by her sister Catherine in that city.

 GIOUS DEVELOPMENT. HER FINAL PEACE. 
 
 THE school days in Hartford began a new era in 
 Harriet s life. It was the formative period, and it is 
 therefore important to say a few words concerning her 
 sister Catherine, under whose immediate supervision she 
 was to continue her education. In fact, no one can 
 comprehend either Mrs. Stowe or her writings without 
 some knowledge of the life and character of this re 
 markable woman, whose strong, vigorous mind and tre 
 mendous personality indelibly stamped themselves on 
 the sensitive, yielding, dreamy, and poetic nature of 
 the younger sister. Mrs. Stowe herself has said that 
 the two persons who most strongly influenced her at 
 this period of her life were her brother Edward and her 
 sister Catherine. 
 
 Catherine was the oldest child of Lyman Beecher 
 and Roxanna Foote, his wife. In a little battered 
 journal found among her papers is a short sketch of 
 her life, written when she was seventy-six years of age. 
 In a tremulous hand she begins : &quot; I was born at East 
 

<page 48>
PROFESSOR FISHER. 23 
 
 Hampton, L. I., September 5, 1800, at 5 p. M., in the 
 large parlor opposite father s study. Don t remember 
 much about it myself.&quot; The sparkle of wit in this 
 brief notice of the circumstances of her birth is very 
 characteristic. All through her life little ripples of fun 
 were continually playing on the surface of that current 
 of intense thought and feeling in which her deep, ear 
 nest nature flowed. 
 
 When she was ten years of age her father removed 
 to Litchfield, Conn., and her happy girlhood was passed 
 in that place. Her bright and versatile mind and ready 
 wit enabled her to pass brilliantly through her school 
 days with but little mental exertion, and those who 
 knew her slightly might have imagined her to be only 
 a bright, thoughtless, light-hearted girl. In Boston, at 
 the age of twenty, she took lessons in music and draw 
 ing, and became so proficient in these branches as to 
 secure a position as teacher in a young ladies school, 
 kept by a Rev. Mr. Judd, an Episcopal clergyman, at 
 New London, Conn. About this time she formed the 
 acquaintance of Professor Alexander Metcalf Fisher, of 
 Yale College, one of the most distinguished young men 
 in New England. In January of the year 1822 they be 
 came engaged, and the following spring Professor Fisher 
 sailed for Europe to purchase books and scientific ap 
 paratus for the use of his department in the college. 
 
 In his last letter to Miss Beecher, dated March 31, 
 1822, he writes : - 
 
 &quot; I set out at 10 precisely to-morrow, in the Albion 
 for Liverpool ; the ship has no superior in the whole 
 number of excellent vessels belonging to this port, and 
 Captain Williams is regarded as first on their list of 
 

<page 49>
24 SCHOOL DAYS IN HARTFORD. 
 
 commanders. The accommodations are admirable 
 fare $140. Unless our ship should speak some one 
 bound to America on the passage, you will probably 
 not hear from me under two months.&quot; 
 
 Before two months had passed came vague rumors of 
 a terrible shipwreck on the coast of Ireland. Then the 
 tidings that the Albion was lost. Then came a letter 
 from Mr. Pond, at Kinsale, Ireland, dated May 2, 
 1822 : 
 
 &quot; You have doubtless heard of the shipwreck of the 
 Albion packet of New York, bound to Liverpool. It 
 was a melancholy shipwreck. It happened about four 
 o clock on the morning of the 22d of April. Professor 
 Fisher, of Yale College, was one of the passengers. 
 Out of twenty-three cabin passengers, but one reached 
 the shore. He is a Mr. Everhart, of Chester County, 
 Pennsylvania. He informs me that Professor Fisher 
 was injured by things that fetched away in the cabin at 
 the time the ship was knocked down. This was be 
 tween 8 and 9 o clock in the evening of the tAventy- 
 first. Mr. Fisher, though badly bruised, was calm and 
 resolute, and assisted Captain Williams by taking the 
 injured compass to his berth and repairing it. About 
 five minutes before the vessel struck Captain Williams 
 informed the passengers of their danger, and all went 
 on deck except Professor Fisher, who remained sitting 
 in his berth. Mr. Everhart was the last person who 
 left the cabin, and the last who ever saw Professor 
 Fisher alive.&quot; 
 
 I should not have spoken of this incident of family 
 history with such minuteness, except for the fact that 
 it is so much a part of Mrs. Stowe s life as to make it 
 

<page 50>
PROFESSOR FISHER. 25 
 
 impossible to understand either her character or her 
 most important works without it. Without this inci 
 dent &quot; The Minister s Wooing &quot; never would have been 
 written, for both Mrs. Marvyn s terrible soul struggles 
 and old Candace s direct and effective solution of all 
 religious difficulties find their origin in this stranded, 
 storm-beaten ship on the coast of Ireland, and the terri 
 ble mental conflicts through which her sister afterward 
 passed, for she believed Professor Fisher eternally lost. 
 No mind more directly and powerfully influenced Har 
 riet s than that of her sister Catherine, unless it was 
 her brother Edward s, and that which acted with such 
 overwhelming power on the strong, unyielding mind 
 of the older sister must have, in time, a permanent and 
 abiding influence on the mind of the younger. 
 
 After Professor Fisher s death his books came into 
 Miss Beecher s possession, and among them was a com 
 plete edition of Scott s works. It was an epoch in the 
 family history when Doctor Beecher came down-stairs 
 one day with a copy of &quot; Ivanhoe &quot; in his hand, and 
 said : &quot; I have always said that my children should not 
 read novels, but they must read these.&quot; 
 
 The two years following the death of Professor 
 Fisher were passed by Miss Catherine Beecher at 
 Franklin, Mass., at the home of Professor Fisher s par 
 ents, where she taught his two sisters, studied mathe 
 matics with his brother Willard, and listened to Doctor 
 Emmons fearless and pitiless preaching. Hers was a 
 mind too strong and buoyant to be crushed and pros 
 trated by that which would have driven a weaker and 
 less resolute nature into insanity. Of her it may well 
 be said : 
 

<page 51>
26 SCHOOL DAYS IN HARTFORD. 
 
 &quot; She faced the spectres of the mind 
 And laid them, thus she came at length 
 To find a stronger faith her own.&quot; 
 
 Gifted naturally with a capacity for close metaphys 
 ical analysis and a robust fearlessness in following her 
 premises to a logical conclusion, she arrived at results 
 startling and original, if not always of permanent value. 
 
 In 1840 she published in the &quot; Biblical Repository &quot; 
 an article on Free Agency, which has been acknowl 
 edged by competent critics as the ablest refutation of 
 Edwards on &quot;The Will&quot; which has appeared. An 
 amusing incident connected with this publication may 
 not be out of place here. A certain eminent theolog 
 ical professor of New England, visiting a distinguished 
 German theologian and speaking of this production, 
 said : &quot; The ablest refutation of Edwards on The 
 Will which was ever written is the work of a woman, 
 the daughter of Dr. Lyman Beecher.&quot; The worthy 
 Teuton raised both hands in undisguised astonishment. 
 
 o 
 
 &quot; You have a woman that can write an able refutation 
 of Edwards on The Will ? God forgive Christopher 
 Columbus for discovering America ! &quot; 
 
 Not finding herself able to love a God whom she 
 thought of in her own language as &quot; a perfectly happy 
 being, unmoved by my sorrows or tears, and looking 
 upon me only with dislike and aversion,&quot; she deter 
 mined &quot; to find happiness in living to do good.&quot; &quot; It 
 was right to pray and read the Bible, so I prayed and 
 read. It was right to try to save others, so I labored 
 for their salvation. I never had any fear of punish 
 ment or hope of reward all these years.&quot; She was tor 
 mented with doubts. &quot; What has the Son of God

 done which the meanest and most selfish creature upon 
 earth would not have done? After making* such a

 cumstances, somehow, without any sorrow or trouble, 
 Jesus Christ had a human nature that suffered and 
 died. If something else besides ourselves will do all 
 the suffering, who would not save millions of wretched 
 beings and receive all the honor and gratitude without 
 any of the trouble ? Sometimes when such thoughts 
 passed through my mind, I felt that it was all pride, 
 rebellion, and sin.&quot; 
 
 So she struggles on, sometimes floundering deep in 
 the mire of doubt, and then lifted for the moment 
 above it by her naturally buoyant spirits, and general 
 tendency to look on the bright side of things. In this 
 condition of mind, she came to Hartford in the winter 
 of 1824, and began a school with eight scholars, and it 
 was in the practical experience of teaching that she 
 found a final solution of all her difficulties. She con 
 tinues : 
 
 &quot; After two or three years I commenced giving in 
 struction in mental philosophy, and at the same time 
 began a regular course of lectures and instructions 
 from the Bible, and was much occupied with plans for 
 governing my school, and in devising means to lead 
 my pupils to become obedient, amiable, and pious. By 
 degrees I finally arrived at the following principles in 
 the government of my school : 
 
 &quot; First. It is indispensable that my scholars should 
 feel that I am sincerely and deeply interested in their 
 best happiness, and the more I can convince them of 
 this, the more ready will be their obedience.

 &quot; Second. The preservation of authority and order 
 depends upon the certainty that unpleasant conse 
 quences to themselves will inevitably be the result of 
 doing wrong. 
 
 &quot; Third. It is equally necessary, to preserve my own 
 influence and their affection, that they should feel that 
 punishment is the natural result of wrong-doing in 
 such a way that they shall regard themselves, instead 
 of me, as the cause of their punishment. 
 
 &quot; Fourth. It is indispensable that my scholars should 
 see that my requisitions are reasonable. In the ma 
 jority of cases this can be shown, and in this way such 
 confidence will be the result that they will trust to my 
 judgment and knowledge, in cases where no explana 
 tion can be given. 
 
 &quot; Fifth. The more I can make my scholars feel that 
 I am actuated by a spirit of self-denying benevolence, 
 the more confidence they will feel in me, and the more 
 they will be inclined to submit to self-denying duties 
 for the good of others. 
 
 &quot; After a while I began to compare my experience 
 with the government of God. I finally got through 
 the whole subject, and drew out the results, and found 
 that all my difficulties were solved and all my darkness 
 dispelled.&quot; 
 
 Her solution in brief is nothing more than that view 
 of the divine nature which was for so many years 
 preached by her brother, Henry Ward Beecher, and 
 set forth in the writings of her sister Harriet, the 
 conception of a being of infinite love, patience, and 
 kindness who suffers with man. The sufferings of 
 Christ on the cross were not the sufferings of his hu- 
 

<page 54>
A SUFFERING GOD. 29 
 
 man nature merely, but the sufferings of the divine 
 nature in Him. In Christ we see the only revelation 
 of God, and that is the revelation of one that suffers. 
 This is the fundamental idea in &quot; The Minister s Woo 
 ing,&quot; and it is the idea of God in which the storm- 
 tossed soul of the older sister at last found rest. All 
 this was directly opposed to that fundamental principle 
 of theologians that God, being the infinitely perfect 
 Being, cannot suffer, because suffering indicates imper 
 fection. To Miss Beecher s mind the lack of ability to 
 suffer with his suffering creatures was a more serious 
 imperfection. Let the reader turn to the twenty-fourth 
 chapter of &quot; The Minister s Wooing &quot; for a complete 
 presentation of this subject, especially the passage that 
 begins, &quot; Sorrow is divine : sorrow is reigning on the 
 throne of the universe.&quot; 
 
 In the fall of the year 1824, while her sister Cath 
 erine was passing through the soul crisis which we have 
 been describing, Harriet came to the school that she 
 had recently established. 
 
 In a letter to her son written in 1886, speaking of 
 this period of her life, Mrs. Stowe says : &quot; Somewhere 
 between my twelfth and thirteenth year I was placed 
 under the care of my elder sister Catherine, in the 
 school that she had just started in Hartford, Connect 
 icut. When I entered the school there were not more 
 than twenty-five scholars in it, but it afterwards num 
 bered its pupils by the hundreds. The school-room was 
 on Main Street, nearly opposite Christ Church, over 
 Sheldon & Colton s harness store, at the sign of the 
 two white horses. I never shall forget the pleasure and 
 surprise which these two white horses produced in my 
 

<page 55>

 mind when I first saw them. One of the young men 
 who worked in the rear of the harness store had a most 
 beautiful tenor voice, and it was my delight to hear 
 him singing in school hours : 
 
 When in cold oblivion s shade 
 Beauty, wealth, and power are laid, 
 When, around the sculptured shrine, 
 Moss shall cling and ivy twine, 
 Where immortal spirits reign, 
 There shall we all meet again. 
 
 &quot; As my father s salary was inadequate to the wants 
 of his large family, the expense of my board in Hart 
 ford was provided for by a species of exchange. Mr. 
 Isaac D. Bull sent a daughter to Miss Pierce s seminary 
 in Litchfield, and she boarded in my father s family in 
 exchange for my board in her father s family. If my 
 good, refined, neat, particular stepmother could have 
 chosen, she could not have found a family more exactly 
 suited to her desires. The very soul of neatness and 
 order pervaded the whole establishment. Mr. I. D. 
 Bull was a fine, vigorous, white-haired man on the de 
 clining slope of life, but full of energy and of kind 
 ness. Mr. Samuel Collins, a neighbor who lived next 
 door, used to frequently come in and make most im 
 pressive and solemn calls on Miss Mary Anne Bull, who 
 was a brunette and a celebrated beauty of the day. I 
 well remember her long raven curls falling from the 
 comb that held them up on the top of her head. She 
 had a rich soprano voice, and was the leading singer in 
 the Centre Church choir. The two brothers also had 
 fine, manly voices, and the family circle was often en 
 livened by quartette singing and flute playing. Mr. 
 Bull kept a very large wholesale drug store on Front

 Street, in which his two sons, Albert and James, were 
 clerks. The oldest son, Watson Bull, had established 
 a retail drug store at the sign of the Good Samaritan/ 
 A large picture of the Good Samaritan relieving the 
 wounded traveler formed a striking part of the sign, 
 and was contemplated by me with reverence. 
 
 &quot; The mother of the family gave me at once a child s 
 place in her hea^rt. A neat little hall chamber was 
 allotted to me for my own, and a well made and kept 
 single bed was given me, of which I took daily care 
 with awful satisfaction. If I was sick nothing could 
 exceed the watchful care and tender nursing of Mrs. 
 Bull. In school my two most intimate friends were 
 the leading scholars. They had written to me before 
 I came and I had answered their letters, and on my 
 arrival they gave me the warmest welcome. One was 
 Catherine Ledyard Cogswell, daughter of the leading 
 and best-beloved of Hartford physicians. The other 
 was Georgiana May, daughter of a most lovely Chris 
 tian woman who was a widow. Georgiana was one of 
 many children, having two younger sisters, Mary and 
 Gertrude, and several brothers. Catherine Cogswell 
 was one of the most amiable, sprightly, sunny-tempered 
 individuals I have ever known. She was, in fact, so 
 much beloved that it was difficult for me to see much 
 of her. Her time was all bespoken by different girls. 
 One might walk with her to school, another had the 
 like promise on the way home. And at recess, of which 
 we had every day a short half hour, there was always 
 a suppliant at Katy s shrine, whom she found it hard 
 to refuse. Yet, among all these claimants, she did keep 
 a little place here and there for me. Georgiana was 
 

<page 59>
32 SCHOOL DAYS IN HARTFORD. 
 
 older and graver, and less fascinating to the other girls, 
 but between her and me there grew up the warmest 
 friendship, which proved lifelong in its constancy. 
 
 &quot; Catherine and Georgiana were reading &amp;lt; Virgil 
 when I came to the school. I began the study of Latin 
 alone, and at the end of the first year made a transla 
 tion of Ovid in verse, which was read at the final 
 exhibition of the school, and regarded, I believe, as a 
 very creditable performance. I was very much inter 
 ested in poetry, and it was my dream to be a poet. I 
 began a drama called Cleon. The scene was laid in 
 the court and time of the emperor Nero, and Cleon was 
 a Greek lord residing at Nero s court, who, after much 
 searching and doubting, at last comes to the knowledge 
 of Christianity. I filled blank book after blank book 
 with this drama. It filled my thoughts sleeping and 
 waking. One day sister Catherine pounced down upon 
 me, and said that I must not waste my time writing 
 poetry, but discipline my mind by the study of Butler s 
 6 Analogy. So after this I wrote out abstracts from 
 the Analogy, and instructed a class of girls as old as 
 myself, being compelled to master each chapter just 
 ahead of the class I was teaching. About this time I 
 read Baxter s Saint s Rest. I do not think any book 
 affected me more powerfully. As I walked the pave 
 ments I used to wish that they might sink beneath me 
 if only I might find myself in heaven. I was at the 
 same time very much interested in Butler s * Analogy, 
 for Mr. Brace used to lecture on such themes when I 
 was at Miss Pierce s school at Litchfield. I also began 
 the study of French and Italian with a Miss Began, 
 who was born in Italy.

 &quot; It was about this time that I first believed myself 
 to be a Christian . I was spending my summer vacation 
 at home, in Litchfield. I shall ever remember that 
 dewy, fresh summer morning. I knew that it was a 
 sacramental Sunday, and thought with sadness that 
 when all the good people should take the sacrificial 
 bread and wine I should be left out. I tried hard to 
 feel my sins and count them up; but what with the 
 birds, the daisies, and the brooks that rippled by the 
 way, it was impossible. I came into church quite dis 
 satisfied with myself, and as I looked upon the pure 
 white cloth, the snowy bread and shining cups, of the 
 communion table, thought with a sigh : There won t 
 be anything for me to-day ; it is all for these grown-up 
 Christians. Nevertheless, when father began to speak, 
 I was drawn to listen by a certain pathetic earnestness 
 in his voice. Most of father s sermons were as unin 
 telligible to me as if he had spoken in Choctaw. But 
 sometimes he preached what he was accustomed to call 
 a f frame sermon ; that is, a sermon that sprung out 
 of the deep feeling of the occasion, and which conse 
 quently could be neither premeditated nor repeated. 
 His text was taken from the Gospel of John, the decla 
 ration of Jesus : Behold, I call you no longer servants, 
 but friends. His theme was Jesus as a soul friend 
 offered to every human being. 
 
 &quot; Forgetting all his hair-splitting distinctions and 
 dialectic subtleties, he spoke in direct, simple, and 
 tender language of the great love of Christ and his 
 care for the soul. He pictured Him as patient with 
 our errors, compassionate with our weaknesses, and 
 sympathetic for our sorrows. He went on to say how 
 

<page 61>
34 SCHOOL DAYS IN HARTFORD. 
 
 He was ever near us, enlightening our ignorance, guid 
 ing our wanderings, comforting our sorrows with a love 
 unwearied by faults, unchilled by ingratitude, till at 
 last He should present us faultless before the throne of 
 his glory with exceeding joy. 
 
 &quot; I sat intent and absorbed. Oh ! how much I 
 needed just such a friend, I thought to myself. Then 
 the awful fact came over me that I had never had any 
 conviction of my sins, and consequently could not come 
 to Him. I longed to cry out ( I will/ when father 
 made his passionate appeal, Come, then, and trust 
 your soul to this faithful friend/ Like a flash it came 
 over me that if I needed conviction of sin, He was able 
 to give me even this also. I would trust Him for the 
 whole. My whole soul was illumined with joy, and 
 as I left the church to walk home, it seemed to me as 
 if Nature herself were hushing her breath to hear the 
 music of heaven. 
 
 &quot; As soon as father came home and was seated in his 
 study, I went up to him and fell in his arms saying, 
 6 Father, I have given myself to Jesus, and He has taken 
 me. I never shall forget the expression of his face as 
 he looked down into my earnest, childish eyes ; it was 
 so sweet, so gentle, and like sunlight breaking out upon 
 a landscape. Is it so ? he said, holding me silently 
 to his heart, as I felt the hot tears fall on my head. 
 Then has a new flower blossomed in the kingdom this 
 day. &quot; 
 
 If she could have been let alone, and taught &quot; to look 
 up and not down, forward and not back, out and not 
 in,&quot; this religious experience might have gone on as 
 sweetly and naturally as the opening of a flower in the 
 

<page 62>
CONVERSION. 35 
 
 gentle rays of the sun. But unfortunately this was 
 not possible at that time, when self-examination was 
 carried to an extreme that was calculated to drive a 
 nervous and sensitive mind well-nigh distracted. / First, 
 even her sister Catherine was afraid that there might 
 be something wrong in the case of a lamb that had 
 come into the fold without being first chased all over 
 the lot by the shepherd ; great stress being laid, in 
 those days, on what was called &quot; being under convic 
 tion.&quot; Then also the pastor of the First Church in 
 Hartford, a bosom friend of Dr. Beecher, looked with 
 melancholy and suspicious eyes on this unusual and 
 doubtful path to heaven, but more of this hereafter. 
 Harriet s conversion took place in the summer of 1825, 
 when she was fourteen, and the following year, April, 
 1826, Dr. Beecher resigned his pastorate in Litchfield 
 to accept a call to the Hanover Street Church, Boston, 
 Mass. In a letter to her grandmother Foote at Guil- 
 ford, dated Hartford, March 4, 1826, Harriet writes : - 
 
 &quot; You have probably heard that our home in Litch 
 field is broken up. Papa has received a call to Boston, 
 and concluded to accept, because he could not support 
 his family in Litchfield. He was dismissed last week 
 Tuesday, and will be here (Hartford) next Tuesday 
 with mamma and Isabel. Aunt Esther will take 
 Charles and Thomas to her house for the present. 
 Papa s salary is to be $2,000 and $500 settlement. 
 
 &quot; I attend school constantly and am making some 
 progress in my studies. I devote most of my attention 
 to Latin and to arithmetic, and hope soon to prepare 
 myself to assist Catherine in the school.&quot; 
 
 This breaking up of the Litchfield home led Harriet, 
 

<page 63>

 under her father s advice, to seek to connect herself 
 with the First Church of Hartford. Accordingly, 
 accompanied by two of her school friends, she went one 
 day to the pastor s study to consult with him concern 
 ing the contemplated step. The good man listened 
 attentively to the child s simple and modest statement 
 of Christian experience, and then with an awful, though 
 kindly, solemnity of speech and manner said, &quot; Harriet, 
 do you feel that if the universe should be destroyed 
 (awful pause) you could be happy with God alone ? &quot; 
 After struggling in vain, in her mental bewilderment, 
 to fix in her mind some definite conception of the 
 meaning of the sounds which fell on her ear like the 
 measured strokes of a bell, the child of fourteen stam 
 mered out, &quot; Yes, sir.&quot; 
 
 &quot; You realize, I trust,&quot; continued the doctor, &quot; in 
 some measure at least, the deceitfulness of your heart, 
 and that in punishment for your sins God might justly 
 leave you to make yourself as miserable as you have 
 made yourself sinful ? &quot; 
 
 &quot; Yes, sir,&quot; again stammered Harriet. 
 
 Having thus effectually, and to his own satisfaction, 
 fixed the child s attention on the morbid and over-sen 
 sitive workings of her own heart, the good and truly 
 kind-hearted man dismissed her with a fatherly bene 
 diction. But where was the joyous ecstasy of that 
 beautiful Sabbath morning of a year ago? Where 
 was that heavenly friend ? Yet was not this as it 
 should be, and might not God leave her &quot; to make her 
 self as miserable as she had made herself sinful &quot; ? 
 
 In a letter addressed to her brother Edward, about 
 this time, she writes : &quot; My whole life is one continued 
 

<page 64>
DESPONDENCY. 37 
 
 struggle : I do nothing right. I yield to temptation 
 almost as soon as it assails me. My deepest feelings 
 are very evanescent. I am beset behind and before, 
 and my sins take away all my happiness. But that 
 which most constantly besets me is pride I can trace 
 almost all my sins back to it.&quot; 
 
 In the mean time, the school is prospering. Febru 
 ary 16, 1827, Catherine writes to Dr. Beecher : &quot; My 
 affairs go on well. The stock is all taken up, and next 
 week I hope to have out the prospectus of the Hart 
 ford Female Seminary. I hope the building will be 
 done, and all things in order, by June. The English 
 lady is coming with twelve pupils from New York.&quot; 
 Speaking of Harriet, who was at this time with her 
 father in Boston, she adds : &quot; I have received some let 
 ters from Harriet to-day which make me feel uneasy. 
 She says, I don t know as I am fit for anything, and I 
 have thought that I could wish to die young, and let 
 the remembrance of me and my faults perish in the 
 grave, rather than live, as I fear I do, a trouble to 
 every one. You don t know how perfectly wretched I 
 often feel : so useless, so weak, so destitute of all 
 energy. Mamma often tells me that I am a strange, 
 inconsistent being. Sometimes I could not sleep, and 
 have groaned and cried till midnight, while in the day 
 time I tried to appear cheerful and succeeded so well 
 that papa reproved me for laughing so much. I was 
 so absent sometimes that I made strange mistakes, and 
 then they all laughed at me, and I laughed, too, 
 though I felt as though I should go distracted. I 
 wrote rules; made out a regular system for dividing 
 my time ; but my feelings vary so much that it is al 
 most impossible for me to be regular. 
 

<page 65>

 But let Harriet &quot; take courage in her dark sorrows 
 and melancholies/ as Carlyle says : &quot; Samuel Johnson 
 too had hypochondrias ; all great souls are apt to have, 
 and to be in thick darkness generally till the eternal 
 ways and the celestial guiding stars disclose themselves, 
 and the vague abyss of life knits itself up into firma 
 ments for them.&quot; 
 
 At the same time (the winter of 1827), Catherine 
 writes to Edward concerning Harriet : &quot; If she could 
 come here (Hartford) it might be the best thing for 
 her, for she can talk freely to me. I can get her 
 books, and Catherine Cogswell, Georgiana May, and 
 her friends here could do more for her than any one 
 in Boston, for they love her and she loves them very 
 much. Georgiana s difficulties are different from Har 
 riet s : she is speculating about doctrines, etc. Harriet 
 will have young society here all the time, which she 
 cannot have at home, and I think cheerful and amus 
 ing friends will do much for her. I can do better in 
 preparing her to teach drawing than any one else, for I 
 best know what is needed.&quot; 
 
 It was evidently necessary that something should be 
 done to restore Harriet to a more tranquil and health 
 ful frame of mind ; consequently in the spring of 
 1827, accompanied by her friend Georgiana May, she 
 went to visit her grandmother Foote at Nut Plains, 
 Guilford. Miss May refers to this visit in a letter to 
 Mrs. Foote, in January of the following winter. 
 
 HARTFORD, January 4, 1828. 
 
 DEAR MRS. FOOTE : . . .1 very often think of 
 you and the happy hours I passed at your house last

 spring. It seems as if it were but yesterday : now, 
 while I am writing, I can see your pleasant house and 
 the familiar objects around you as distinctly as the day 
 I left them. Harriet and I are very much the same 
 girls we were then. I do not believe we have altered 
 very much, though she is improved in some respects. 
 
 The August following this visit to Guilford Harriet 
 writes to her brother Edward in a vein which is still 
 streaked with sadness, but shows some indication of 
 returning health of mind. 
 
 o 
 
 &quot; Many of my objections you did remove that after 
 noon we spent together. After that I was not as un 
 happy as I had been. I felt, nevertheless, that my 
 views were very indistinct and contradictory, and feared 
 that if you left me thus I might return to the same 
 dark, desolate state in which I had been all summer. 
 I felt that my immortal interest, my happiness for both 
 worlds, was depending on the turn my feelings might 
 take. In my disappointment and distress I called upon 
 God, and it seemed as if I was heard. I felt that He 
 could supply the loss of all earthly love. All misery 
 and darkness were over. I felt as if restored, never 
 more to fall. Such sober certainty of waking bliss had 
 long been a stranger to me. But even then I had 
 doubts as to whether these feelings were right, because 
 I felt love to God alone without that ardent love for 
 my fellow-creatures which Christians have often felt. 
 ... I cannot say exactly what it is makes me reluc 
 tant to speak of my feelings. It costs me an effort to 
 express feeling of any kind, but more particularly to 
 speak of my private religious feelings. If any one 
 

<page 67>
40 SCHOOL DAYS IN HARTFORD. 
 
 questions me, my first impulse is to conceal all I can. 
 As for expression of affection towards my brothers 
 and sisters, my companions or friends, the stronger 
 the affection the less inclination have I to express it. 
 Yet sometimes I think myself the most frank, open, 
 and communicative of beings, and at other times the 
 most reserved. If you can resolve all these caprices 
 into general principles, you will do more than I can. 
 Your speaking so much philosophically has a tendency 
 to repress confidence. We never wish to have our 
 feelings analyzed down ; and very little, nothing, that 
 we say brought to the test of mathematical demonstra 
 tion. 
 
 &quot; It appears to me that if I only could adopt the 
 views of God you presented to my mind, they would 
 exert a strong and beneficial influence over my char 
 acter. But I am afraid to accept them for several rea 
 sons. First, it seems to be taking from the majesty 
 and dignity of the divine character to suppose that his 
 happiness can be at all affected by the conduct of his 
 sinful, erring creatures. Secondly, it seems to me that 
 such views of God would have an effect on our own 
 minds in lessening that reverence and fear which is one 
 of the greatest motives to us for action. For, although 
 to a generous mind the thought of the love of God 
 would be a sufficient incentive to action, there are times 
 of coldness when that love is not felt, and then there 
 remains no sort of stimulus. I find as I adopt these 
 sentiments I feel less fear of God, and, in view of sin, 
 I feel only a sensation of grief which is more easily dis 
 pelled and forgotten than that I formerly felt.&quot; 
 
 A letter dated January 3, 1828, shows us that Har&amp;gt; 
 

<page 68>
LESSONS IN PAINTING. 41 
 
 riet had returned to Hartford and was preparing her 
 self to teach drawing and painting, under the direction 
 of her sister Catherine. 
 
 MY DEAR GRANDMOTHER, I should have written 
 before to assure you of my remembrance of you, but I 
 have been constantly employed, from nine in the morn 
 ing till after dark at night, in taking lessons of a paint 
 ing and drawing master, with only an intermission long 
 enough to swallow a little dinner which was sent to me 
 in the school-room. You may easily believe that after 
 spending the day in this manner, I did not feel in a very 
 epistolary humor in the evening, and if I had been, I 
 could not have written, for when I did not go immedi 
 ately to bed I was obliged to get a long French lesson. 
 
 The seminary is finished, and the school going on 
 nicely. Miss Clarissa Brown is assisting Catherine in 
 the school. Besides her, Catherine, and myself, there 
 are two other teachers who both board in the family 
 with us : one is Miss Degan, an Italian lady who 
 teaches French and Italian ; she rooms with me, and is 
 very interesting and agreeable. Miss Hawks is room 
 ing with Catherine. In some respects she reminds me 
 very much of my mother. She is gentle, affectionate, 
 modest, and retiring, and much beloved by all the 
 scholars. ... I am still going on with my French, 
 and carrying two young ladies through Virgil, and if 
 I have time, shaU commence Italian. 
 
 I am very comfortable and happy. 
 
 I propose, my dear grandmamma, to send you by 
 the first opportunity a dish of fruit of my own paint 
 ing. Pray do not now devour it in anticipation, for I 
 

<page 69>

 cannot promise that you will not find it sadly tasteless 
 in reality. If so, please excuse it, for the sake of the 
 poor young artist. I admire to cultivate a taste for 
 painting, and I wish to improve it; it was what my 
 dear mother admired and loved, and I cherish it for her 
 sake. I have thought more of this dearest of all earthly 
 friends these late years, since I have been old enough 
 to know her character and appreciate her worth. I 
 sometimes think that, had she lived, I might have been 
 both better and happier than I now am, but God is 
 good and wise in all his ways. 
 
 A letter written to her brother Edward in Boston, 
 dated March 27, 1828, shows how slowly she adopted 
 the view of God j that finally became one of the most 
 characteristic elements in her writings. 
 
 &quot; I think that those views of God which you have 
 presented to me have had an influence in restoring my 
 mind to its natural tone. But still, after all, God is a 
 being afar off. He is so far above us that anything 
 but the most distant reverential affection seems almost 
 sacrilegious. It is that affection that can lead us to be 
 familiar that the heart needs. But easy and familiar 
 expressions of attachment and that sort of confidential 
 communication which I should address to papa or you 
 would be improper for a subject to address to a king, 
 much less for us to address to the King of kings. The 
 language of prayer is of necessity stately and formal, 
 and we cannot clothe all the little minutia3 of our wants 
 and troubles in it. I wish I could describe to you how 
 I feel when -I pray. I feel that I love God, that is, 
 that I love Christ, that I find comfort and happiness 
 

<page 70>
IS GOD LOVE? 43 
 
 in it, and yet it is not that kind of comfort which 
 would arise from free communication of my wants and 
 sorrows to a friend. I sometimes wish that the Saviour 
 were visibly present in this world, that I might go to 
 Him for a solution of some of my difficulties. . . . Do 
 you think, my dear brother, that there is such a thing 
 as so realizing the presence and character of God that 
 He can supply the place of earthly friends ? I really 
 wish to know what you think of this. ... Do you 
 suppose that God really loves sinners before they come 
 to Him ? Some say that we ought to tell them that 
 God hates them, that He looks on them with utter ab 
 horrence, and that they must love Him before He will 
 look on them otherwise. Is it right to say to those 
 who are in deep distress, God is interested in you ; He 
 feels for and loves you ? &quot; 
 
 Appended to this letter is a short note from Miss 
 Catherine Beecher, who evidently read the letter over 
 and answered Harriet s questions herself. She writes : 
 &quot; When the young man came to Jesus, is it not said 
 that Jesus loved him, though he was unrenewed ? &quot; 
 
 In April, 1828, Harriet again writes to her brother 
 Edward : 
 
 &quot;I have had more reason to be grateful to that 
 friend than ever before. He has not left me in all my 
 weakness. It seems to me that my love to Him is the 
 love of despair. All my communion with Him, though 
 sorrowful, is soothing. I am painfully sensible of ig 
 norance and deficiency, but still I feel that I am will 
 ing that He should know all. He will look on all that 
 is wrong only to purify and reform. He will never be 
 irritated or impatient. He will never show me my 
 

<page 71>
44 SCHOOL DAYS IN HARTFORD. 
 
 faults in such a manner as to irritate without helping 
 me. A friend to whom I would acknowledge all my 
 faults must be perfect. Let any one once be provoked, 
 once speak harshly to me, once sweep all the chords of 
 my soul out of tune, I never could confide there again. 
 It is only to the most perfect Being in the universe 
 that imperfection can look and hope for patience. How 
 strange ! . . . You do not know how harsh and for 
 bidding everything seems, compared with his character. 
 All through the day in my intercourse with others, 
 everything has a tendency to destroy the calmness of 
 mind gained by communion with Him. One flatters 
 me, another is angry with me, another is unjust to me. 
 
 &quot; You speak of your predilections for literature hav 
 ing been a snare to you. I have found it so myself. 
 I can scarcely think, without tears and indignation, 
 that all that is beautiful and lovely and poetical has 
 been laid on other altars. Oh ! will there never be a 
 poet with a heart enlarged and purified by the Holy 
 Spirit, who shall throw all the graces of harmony, 
 all the enchantments of feeling, pathos, and poetry, 
 around sentiments worthy of them? ... It matters 
 little what service He has for me. . . . I do not mean 
 to live in vain. He has given me talents, and I will 
 lay them at his feet, well satisfied, if He will accept 
 them. All my powers He can enlarge. He made my 
 mind, and He can teach me to cultivate and exert its 
 faculties.&quot; 
 
 The following November she writes from Groton, 
 Conn., to Miss May : 
 
 &quot; I am in such an uncertain, unsettled state, travel 
 ing back and forth, that I have very little time to write. 
 

<page 72>
VISITS GROTON. 45 
 
 In the first place, on my arrival in Boston I was 
 obliged to spend two days in talking and telling news. 
 Then after that came calling, visiting, etc., and then I 
 came off to Groton to see my poor brother George, who 
 was quite out of spirits and in very trying circum 
 stances. To-morrow I return to Boston and spend four 
 or five days, and then go to Franklin, where I spend 
 the rest of my vacation. 
 
 &quot; I found the folks all well on my coming to Boston, 
 and as to my new brother, James, he has nothing to 
 distinguish him from forty other babies, except a very 
 large pair of blue eyes and an uncommonly fair com 
 plexion, a thing which is of no sort of use or advan 
 tage to a man or boy. 
 
 &quot; I am thinking very seriously of remaining in Gro 
 ton and taking care of the female school, and at the 
 same tune being of assistance and company for George. 
 On some accounts it would not be so pleasant as re 
 turning to Hartford, for I should be among strangers. 
 Nothing upon this point can be definitely decided till 
 I have returned to Boston, and talked to papa and 
 Catherine.&quot; 
 
 Evidently papa and Catherine did not approve of 
 the Groton plan, for in February of the following 
 winter Harriet writes from Hartford to Edward, who 
 is at this time with his father in Boston : 
 
 &quot;My situation this winter (1829) is in many respects 
 pleasant. I room with three other teachers, Miss 
 Fisher, Miss Mary Button, and Miss Brigham. Ann 
 Fisher you know. Miss Dutton is about twenty, has a 
 fine mathematical mind, and has gone as far into that 
 science perhaps as most students at college. She is 
 

<page 73>
46 SCHOOL DAYS IN HARTFORD. 
 
 also, as I am told, quite learned in the languages. . . 
 Miss Brigham is somewhat older : is possessed of a fine 
 mind and most unconquerable energy and perseverance 
 of character. From early childhood she has been de 
 termined to obtain an education, and to attain to a cer 
 tain standard. Where persons are determined to be 
 anything, they will be. I think, for this reason, she 
 will make a first-rate character. Such are my compan 
 ions. We spend our time in school during the day, 
 and in studying in the evening. My plan of study is 
 to read rhetoric and prepare exercises for my class the 
 first half hour in the evening ; after that the rest of 
 the evening is divided between French and Italian. 
 
 o 
 
 Thus you see the plan of my employment and the char 
 acter of my immediate companions. Besides these, 
 there are others among the teachers and scholars who 
 must exert an influence over my character. Miss De- 
 gan, whose constant occupation it is to make others 
 laugh ; Mrs. Gamage, her room-mate, a steady, de 
 voted, sincere Christian. . . . Little things have great 
 power over me, and if I meet with the least thing that 
 crosses my feelings, I am often rendered unhappy for 
 days and weeks. ... I wish I could bring myself to 
 feel perfectly indifferent to the opinions of others. I 
 believe that there never was a person more dependent 
 on the good and evil opinions of those around than I 
 am. This desire to be loved forms, I fear, the great 
 motive for all my actions. ... I have been reading 
 carefully the book of Job, and I do not think that it 
 contains the views of God which you presented to me. 
 God seems to have stripped a dependent creature of all 
 that renders life desirable, and then to have answered 
 

<page 74>
DOUBTS AND FEARS. 47 
 
 his complaints from the whirlwind; and instead of 
 showing mercy and pity, to have overwhelmed him by 
 a display of his power and justice. . . . With the view 
 I received from you, I should have expected that a be 
 ing who sympathizes with his guilty, afflicted creatures 
 would not have spoken thus. Yet, after all, I do be 
 lieve that God is such a being as you represent Him to 
 be, and in the New Testament I find in the character 
 of Jesus Christ a revelation of God as merciful and 
 compassionate ; in fact, just such a God as I need. 
 
 &quot; Somehow or another you have such a reasonable 
 sort of way of saying things that when I come to re 
 flect I almost always go over to your side. . . . My 
 mind is often perplexed, and such thoughts arise in it 
 that I cannot pray, and I become bewildered. The 
 wonder to me is, how all ministers and all Christians 
 can feel themselves so inexcusably sinful, when it seems 
 to me we all come into the world in such a way that it 
 would be miraculous if we did not sin. Mr. Hawes 
 always says in prayer, * We have nothing to offer in 
 extenuation of any of our sins, and I always think 
 when he says it, that we have everything to offer in 
 extenuation. The case seems to me exactly as if I had 
 been brought into the world with such a thirst for 
 ardent spirits that there was just a possibility, though 
 no hope, that I should resist, and then my eternal hap 
 piness made dependent on my being temperate. Some 
 times when I try to confess my sins, I feel that after 
 all I am more to be pitied than blamed, for I have 
 never known the time when I have not had a tempta 
 tion within me so strong that it was certain I should 
 not overcome it. This thought shocks me, but it 
 

<page 75>
48 SCHOOL DAYS IN HARTFORD. 
 
 comes with such force, and so appealingly, to all my 
 consciousness, that it stifles all sense of sin. . . . 
 
 &quot; Sometimes when I read the Bible, it seems to be 
 wholly grounded on the idea that the sin of man is 
 astonishing, inexcusable, and without palliation or cause, 
 and the atonement is spoken of as such a wonderful 
 and undeserved mercy that I am filled with amazement. 
 Yet if I give up the Bible I gain nothing, for the 
 providence of God in nature is just as full of mystery, 
 and of the two I think that the Bible, with all its diffi 
 culties, is preferable to being without it ; for the Bible 
 holds out the hope that in a future world all shall be 
 made plain. ... So you see I am, as Mr. Hawes says, 
 on the waves/ and all I can do is to take the word of 
 God that He does do right and there I rest.&quot; 
 
 The following summer, in July, she writes to Ed 
 ward : &quot; I have never been so happy as this summer. 
 I began it in more suffering than I ever before have 
 felt, but there is One whom I daily thank for all that 
 suffering, since I hope that it has brought me at last 
 to rest entirely in Him. I do hope that my long, long 
 course of wandering and darkness and unhappiness is 
 over, and that I have found in Him who died for me 
 all, and more than all, I could desire. Oh, Edward, you 
 can feel as I do ; you can speak of Him ! There are 
 few, very few, who can. Christians in general do not 
 seem to look to Him as their best friend, or realize any 
 thing of his unutterable love. They speak with a cold, 
 vague, reverential awe, but do not speak as if in the 
 habit of close and near communion ; as if they confided 
 to Him every joy and sorrow and constantly looked to 
 Him for direction and guidance. I cannot express to 
 

<page 76>
REST AT LAST. 49 
 
 you, my brother, I cannot tell you, how that Saviour 
 appears to me* To bear with one so imperfect, so 
 weak, so inconsistent, as myself, implied long-suffering 
 and patience more than words can express. I love 
 most to look on Christ as my teacher, as one who, 
 knowing the utmost of my sinfulness, my waywardness, 
 my folly, can still have patience ; can reform, purify, 
 and daily make me more like himself.&quot; 
 
 So, after four years of struggling and suffering, she 
 returns to the place where she started from as a child 
 of thirteen. It has been like watching a ship with 
 straining masts and storm-beaten sails, buffeted by the 
 waves, making for the harbor, and coming at last to 
 quiet anchorage.^ There have been, of course, times of 
 darkness and depression, but never any permanent loss 
 of the religious trustfulness and peace of mind indi 
 cated by this letter. 
 
 The next three years were passed partly in Boston, 
 and partly in Guilford and Hartford. Writing of this 
 period of her life to the Rev. Charles Beecher, she 
 says : 
 
 MY DEAR BROTHER, The looking over of father s 
 letters in the period of his Boston life brings forcibly 
 to my mind many recollections. At this time I was 
 more with him, and associated in companionship of 
 thought and feeling for a longer period than any other 
 of my experience. 
 
 In the summer of 1832 she writes to Miss May, 
 revealing her spiritual and intellectual lif e in a degree 
 unusual, even for her. 
 

<page 77>

 &quot; After the disquisition on myself above cited, you 
 will be prepared to understand the changes through 
 which this wonderful ego et me ipse has passed. 
 
 &quot; The amount of the matter has been, as this inner 
 world of mine has become worn out and untenable, I 
 have at last concluded to come out of it and live in the 
 
 external one, and, as F S once advised me, to 
 
 give up the pernicious habit of meditation to the first 
 Methodist minister that would take it, and try to mix 
 in society somewhat as another person would. 
 
 &quot; Horas non numero nisi serenas. 9 Uncle Sam 
 uel, who sits by me, has just been reading the above 
 motto, the inscription on a sun-dial in Venice. It 
 strikes me as having a distant relationship to what I 
 was going to say. I have come to a firm resolution to 
 count no hours but unclouded ones, and to let all 
 others slip out of my memory and reckoning as quickly 
 as possible. . . . 
 
 I am trying to cultivate a general spirit of kindli 
 ness towards everybody. Instead of shrinking into a 
 corner to notice how other people behave, I am holding 
 out my hand to the right and to the left, and forming 
 casual or incidental acquaintances with all who will be 
 acquainted with me. In this way I find society full of 
 interest and pleasure a pleasure which please th me 
 more because it is not old and worn out. From these 
 friendships I expect little ; therefore generally receive 
 more than I expect. From past friendships I have 
 expected everything, and must of necessity have been 
 disappointed. The kind words and looks and smiles I 
 call forth by looking and smiling are not much by 
 themselves, but they form a very pretty flower border 
 

<page 78>
LOVE FOR FRIENDS. 51 
 
 to the way of life. They embellish the day or the 
 hour as it passes, and when they fade they only do just 
 as you expected they would. This kind of pleasure in 
 acquaintanceship is new to me. I never tried it before. 
 When I used to meet persons, the first inquiry was, 
 6 Have they such and such a character, or have they 
 anything that might possibly be of use or harm to 
 me ? &quot; 
 
 It is striking, the degree of interest a letter had for 
 her. 
 
 &quot; Your long letter came this morning. It revived 
 much in my heart. Just think how glad I must have 
 been this morning to hear from you. I was glad. . . . 
 I thought of it through all the vexations of school this 
 morning. ... I have a letter at home; and when I 
 came home from school, I went leisurely over it. 
 
 &quot; This evening I have spent in a little social party, 
 a dozen or so, and I have been zealously talking 
 all the evening. When I came to my cold} lonely room, 
 there was your letter lying on the dressing-table. It 
 touched me with a sort of painful pleasure, for it seems 
 to me uncertain, improbable, that I shall ever return 
 and find you as I have found your letter. Oh, my 
 
 dear G , it is scarcely well to love friends thus. 
 
 The greater part that I see cannot move me deeply. 
 They are present, and I enjoy them ; they pass and I 
 forget them. But those that I love differently ; those 
 that I LOVE ; and oh, how much that word means ! I 
 feel sadly about them. They may change ; they must 
 die; they are separated from me, and I ask myself 
 why should I wish to love with all the pains and penal 
 ties of such conditions ? I check myself when express-

 ing feelings like this, so much has been said of it by 
 the sentimental, who talk what they could not have 
 felt. But it is so deeply, sincerely so in me, that some 
 times it will overflow. Well, there is a heaven, a 
 heaven, a world of love, and love after all is the life- 
 blood, the existence, the aU in all of mind.&quot; 
 
 This is the key to her whole life. She was impelled 
 by love, and did what she did, and wrote what she 
 did, under the impulse of love. Never could &quot; Uncle 
 Tom s Cabin &quot; or &quot; The Minister s Wooing &quot; have been 
 written, unless by one to whom love was the &quot; life-blood 
 of existence, the all in all of mind.&quot; Years afterwards 
 Mrs. Browning was to express this same thought in the 
 language of poetry. 
 
 &quot; But when a soul by choice and conscience doth 
 Throw out her full force on another soul, 
 The conscience and the concentration both 
 Make mere life love. For life in perfect whole 
 And aim consummated is love in sooth, 
 As nature s magnet heat rounds pole with pole.&quot;

 IN 1832, after having been settled for six years over 
 the Hanover Street Church in Boston, Dr. Beecher 
 received and finally accepted a most urgent call to 
 become President of Lane Theological Seminary in Cin 
 cinnati. This institution had been chartered in 1829, 
 and in 1831 funds to the amount of nearly $70,000 
 had been promised to it provided that Dr. Beecher 
 accepted the presidency. It was hard for this New. 
 England family to sever the ties of a lifetime and enter 
 on so long a journey to the far distant West of those 
 days ; but being fully persuaded that their duty lay in 
 this direction, they undertook to perform it cheerfully 
 and willingly. With Dr. Beecher and his wife were 
 to go Miss Catherine Beecher, who had conceived the 
 scheme of founding in Cincinnati, then considered the 
 capital of the West, a female college, and Harriet, who 
 was to act as her principal assistant. In the party 
 were also George, who was to enter Lane as a student, 
 Isabella, James, the youngest son, and Miss Esther 
 Beecher, the &quot; Aunt Esther &quot; of the children. 
 

<page 81>
54 CINCINNATI. 
 
 Before making his final decision, Dr. Beecher, ac 
 companied by his daughter Catherine, visited Cincin 
 nati to take a general survey of their proposed battle 
 field, and their impressions of the city are given in the 
 following letter written by the latter to Harriet in Bos 
 ton : 
 
 &quot; Here we are at last at our journey s end, alive and 
 well. We are staying with Uncle Samuel (Foote), 
 whose establishment I will try and sketch for you. It 
 is on a height in the upper part of the city, and com 
 mands a fine view of the whole of the lower town. 
 The city does not impress me as being so very new. It 
 iis true everything looks neat and clean, but it is com 
 pact, and many of the houses are of brick and very 
 handsomely built. The streets run at right angles to 
 each other, and are wide and well paved. We reached 
 here in three days from Wheeling, and soon felt our 
 selves at home. The next day father and I, with three 
 gentlemen, walked out to Walnut Hills. The country 
 around the city consists of a constant succession and 
 variety of hills of all shapes and sizes, forming an ex 
 tensive amphitheatre. The site of the seminary is very 
 beautiful and picturesque, though I was disappointed 
 to find that both river and city are hidden by interven 
 ing hills. I never saw a place so capable of being ren 
 dered a paradise by the improvements of taste as the 
 environs of this city. Walnut Hills are so elevated 
 and cool that people have to leave there to be sick, it 
 is said. The seminary is located on a farm of one hun 
 dred and twenty-five acres of fine land, with groves of 
 superb trees around it, about two miles from the city. 
 We have finally decided on the spot where our house 
 

<page 82>
PLEASANT PROSPECTS. 55 
 
 shall stand in case we decide to come, and you cannot 
 (where running water or the seashore is wanting) find 
 another more delightful spot for a residence. It is on 
 an eminence, with a grove running up from the back 
 to the very doors, another grove across the street in 
 front, and fine openings through which distant hills and 
 the richest landscapes appear. 
 
 &quot; I have become somewhat acquainted with those 
 ladies we shall have the most to do with, and find them 
 intelligent, New England sort of folks. Indeed, this 
 is a New England city in all its habits, and its inhab 
 itants are more than half from New England. The 
 Second Church, which is the best in the city, will give 
 father a unanimous call to be their minister, with the 
 understanding that he will give them what time he can 
 spare from the seminary. 
 
 &quot; I know of no place in the world where there is so 
 fair a prospect of finding everything that makes social 
 and domestic life pleasant. Uncle John and Uncle 
 Samuel are just the intelligent, sociable, free, and hos 
 pitable sort of folk that everybody likes and everybody 
 feels at home with. 
 
 &quot; The folks are very anxious to have a school on cm- 
 plan set on foot here. We can have fine rooms in the 
 city college building, which is now unoccupied, and 
 everybody is ready to lend a helping hand. As to 
 father, I never saw such a field of usefulness and in 
 fluence as is offered to him here.&quot; 
 
 This, then, was the field of labor in which the next 
 eighteen years of the life of Mrs. Stowe were to be 
 passed. At this time her sister Mary, was married and 
 living in Hartford, her brothers Henry Ward and 
 

<page 83>
56 CINCINNA TI. 
 
 Charles were in college, while William and Edward, al 
 ready licensed to preach, were preparing to follow their 
 father to the West. 
 
 Mr. Beecher s preliminary journey to Cincinnati was 
 undertaken in the early spring of 1832, but he was not 
 ready to remove his family until October of that year. 
 An interesting account of this westward journey is 
 given by Mrs. Stowe in a letter sent back to Hartford 
 from Cincinnati, as follows : 
 
 &quot; Well, my dear, the great sheet is out and the letter 
 is begun. All our family are here (in New York), and 
 in good health. 
 
 &quot; Father is to perform to-night in the Chatham 
 Theatre ! positively for the last time this season ! 
 I don t know, I m sure, as we shall ever get to Pitts 
 burgh. Father is staying here begging money for the 
 Biblical Literature professorship; the incumbent is to 
 be C. Stowe. Last night we had a call from Arthur 
 Tappan and Mr. Eastman. Father begged $2,000 
 yesterday, and now the good people are praying him 
 to abide certain days, as he succeeds so well. They are 
 talking of sending us off and keeping him here. I 
 really dare not go and see Aunt Esther and mother 
 now ; they were in the depths of tribulation before at 
 staying so long, and now, 
 
 In the lowest depths, another deep ! 
 
 Father is in high spirits. He is all in his own element, 
 dipping into books ; consulting authorities for his 
 oration ; going round here, there, everywhere ; begging, 
 borrowing, and spoiling the Egyptians ; delighted with 
 past success and confident for the future. 
 

<page 84>

<page 86>
INCIDENTS OF THE JOURNEY. 57 
 
 &quot; Wednesday. Still in New York. I believe it 
 would kill me dead to live long in the way I have been 
 doing since I have been here. It is a sort of agreeable 
 delirium. There s only one thing about it, it is too 
 scattering. I begin to be athirst for the waters of 
 quietness.&quot; 
 
 Writing from Philadelphia, she adds : - 
 &quot; Well, we did get away from New York at last, but 
 it was through much tribulation. The truckman car 
 ried all the family baggage to the wrong wharf, and, 
 after waiting and waiting on board the boat, we were 
 obliged to start without it, George remaining to look it 
 up. Arrived here late Saturday evening, dull, driz 
 zling weather ; poor Aunt Esther in dismay, not a 
 clean cap to put on, mother in like state ; all of us 
 destitute. We went, half to Dr. Skinner s and half to 
 Mrs. Elmes s : mother, Aunt Esther, father, and James 
 to the former ; Kate, Bella, and myself to Mr. Elmes s. 
 They are rich, hospitable folks, and act the part of 
 Gaius in apostolic times. . . . Our trunks came this 
 morning. Father stood and saw them all brought into 
 Dr. Skinner s entry, and then he swung his hat and 
 gave a hurrah, as any man would whose wife had not 
 had a clean cap or ruffle for a week. Father does not 
 succeed very well in opening purses here. Mr. East 
 man says, however, that this is not of much conse 
 quence. I saw to-day a notice in the Philadelphian 
 about father, setting forth how this distinguished 
 brother, with his large family, having torn themselves 
 from the endearing scenes of their home/ etc., etc., 
 6 were going, like Jacob, etc., a very scriptural and 
 appropriate flourish. It is too much after the manner 
 

<page 87>
58 CINCINNATI. 
 
 of men, or, as Paul says, speaking as a fool. A num 
 ber of the pious people of this city are coming here this 
 evening to hold a prayer-meeting with reference to the 
 journey and its object. For this I thank them.&quot; 
 
 From Downington she writes : 
 
 &quot; Here we all are, Noah and his wife and his sons 
 and his daughters, with the cattle and creeping things, 
 all dropped down in the front parlor of this tavern, 
 about thirty miles from Philadelphia. If to-day is a 
 fair specimen of our journey, it will be a very pleasant, 
 obliging driver, good roads, good spirits, good dinner, 
 fine scenery, and now and then some ( psalms and 
 hymns and spiritual songs ; for with George on board 
 you may be sure of music of some kind. Moreover, 
 George has provided himself with a quantity of tracts, 
 and he and the children have kept up a regular dis 
 charge at all the wayfaring people we encountered. I 
 tell him he is peppering the land with moral influ 
 ence. 
 
 &quot; We are all well ; all in good spirits. Just let me 
 give you a peep into our traveling household. Behold 
 us, then, in the front parlor of this country inn, all as 
 much at home as if we were in Boston. Father is sit 
 ting opposite to me at this table, reading ; Kate is writ 
 ing a billet-doux to Mary on a sheet like this ; Thomas 
 is opposite, writing in a little journal that he keeps; 
 Sister Bell, too, has her little record ; George is waiting 
 for a seat that he may produce his paper and write. As 
 for me, among the multitude of my present friends, my 
 heart still makes occasional visits to absent ones, 
 visits full of pleasure, and full of cause of gratitude to 
 Him who gives us friends. I have thought of you 
 

<page 88>
PAST AND FUTURE. 59 
 
 often to-day, my G. We stopped this noon at a sub 
 stantial Pennsylvania tavern, and among the flowers in 
 the garden was a late monthly honeysuckle like the one 
 at North Guilford. I made a spring for it, but George 
 secured the finest bunch, which he wore in his button 
 hole the rest of the noon. 
 
 &quot; This afternoon, as we were traveling, we struck up 
 and sang Jubilee. It put me in mind of the time 
 when we used to ride along the rough North Guilford 
 roads and make the air vocal as we went along. Pleas 
 ant times those. Those were blue skies, and that was 
 a beautiful lake and noble pine-trees and rocks they 
 were that hung over it. But those we shah 1 look upon 
 * na mair. 
 
 &quot; Well, my dear, there is a land where we shall not 
 love and leave. Those skies shall never cease to shine, 
 the waters of life we shall never be called upon to 
 leave. We have here no continuing city, but we seek 
 one to come. In such thoughts as these I desire ever 
 to rest, and with such words as these let us comfort 
 one another and edify one another. 
 
 &quot; Harrisburg, Sunday evening. Mother, Aunt Esther, 
 George, and the little folks have just gathered into 
 Kate s room, and we have just been singing. Father 
 has gone to preach for Mr. De Witt. To-morrow we 
 expect to travel sixty-two miles, and in two more days 
 shall reach Wheeling ; there we shall take the steam 
 boat to Cincinnati.&quot; 
 
 On the same journey George Beecher writes : 
 
 &quot; We had poor horses in crossing the mountains. 
 Our average rate for the last four days to Wheeling 
 was forty-four miles. The journey, which takes the 
 

<page 89>
60 CINCINNATI. 
 
 mail-stage forty-eight hours, took us eight days. At 
 Wheeling we deliberated long whether to go on board 
 a boat for Cincinnati, but the prevalence of the cholera 
 there at last decided us to remain. While at Wheeling 
 father preached eleven times, nearly every evening, 
 and gave them the Taylorite heresy on sin and de 
 crees to the highest notch ; and what amused me most 
 was to hear him establish it from the Confession of 
 Faith. It went high and dry, however, above all objec 
 tions, and they were delighted with it, even the old 
 school men, since it had not been christened heresy 
 in their hearing. After remaining in Wheeling eight 
 days, we chartered a stage for Cincinnati, and started 
 next morning. 
 
 &quot; At Granville, Ohio, we were invited to stop and 
 attend a protracted meeting. Being in no great hurry 
 to enter Cincinnati till the cholera had left, we con 
 sented. We spent the remainder of the week there, 
 and I preached five times and father four. The inter 
 est was increasingly deep and solemn each day, and 
 when we left there were forty-five cases of conversion 
 in the town, besides those from the surrounding towns. 
 The people were astonished at the doctrine ; said they 
 never saw the truth so plain in their lives.&quot; 
 
 Although the new-comers were cordially welcomed 
 in Cincinnati, and everything possible was done for 
 their comfort and to make them feel at home, they felt 
 themselves to be strangers in a strange land. Their 
 homesickness and yearnings for New England are set 
 forth by the following extracts from Mrs. Stowe s an 
 swer to the first letter they received from Hartford 
 after leaving there : 
 

<page 90>
A LETTER FROM HOME. 61 
 
 MY DEAR SISTER (Mary), The Hartford letter 
 from all and sundry has just arrived, and after cutting 
 all manner of capers expressive of thankfulness, I have 
 skipped three stairs at a time up to the study to begin 
 an answer. My notions of answering letters are ac 
 cording to the literal sense of the word ; not waiting 
 six months and then scrawling a lazy reply, but sitting 
 down the moment you have read a letter, and telling, 
 as Dr. Woods says, &quot; How the subject strikes you.&quot; I 
 wish I could be clear that the path of duty lay in talk 
 ing to you this afternoon, but as I find a loud call to 
 consider the heels of George s stockings, I must only 
 write a word or two, and then resume my darning- 
 needle. You don t know how anxiously we all have 
 watched for some intelligence from Hartford. Not a 
 day has passed when I have not been the efficient agent 
 in getting somebody to the post-office, and every day 
 my heart has sunk at the sound of &quot; no letters.&quot; I felt 
 a tremor quite sufficient for a lover when I saw your 
 handwriting once more, so you see that in your old age 
 you can excite quite as much emotion as did the admir 
 able Miss Byron in her adoring Sir Charles. I hope 
 the consideration and digestion of this fact will have 
 its due weight in encouraging you to proceed. 
 
 The fact of our having received said letter is as yet 
 a state secret, not to be made known till all our family 
 circle &quot; in full assembly meet &quot; at the tea-table. Then 
 what an illumination ! &quot; How we shall be edified and 
 fructified,&quot; as that old Methodist said. It seems too 
 bad to keep it from mother and Aunt Esther a whole 
 afternoon, but then I have the comfort of thinking 
 that we are consulting for their greatest happiness &quot; on 
 the whole,&quot; which is metaphysical benevolence.

 So kind Mrs. Parsons stopped in the very midst 
 of her pumpkin pies to think of us ? Seems to me I 
 can see her bright, cheerful face now ! And then 
 those well known handwritings ! We do love our 
 Hartford friends dearly; there canjbe, I think, no con 
 troverting that fact. Kate says that the word love is 
 used in six senses, and I am sure in some one of them 
 they will all come in. Well, good-by for the present. 
 
 Evening. Having finished the last hole on George s 
 black vest, I stick in my needle and sit down to be 
 sociable. You don t know how coming away from 
 New England has sentimentalized us all ! Never was 
 there such an abundance of meditation on our native 
 land, on the joys of friendship, the pains of separation. 
 Catherine had an alarming paroxysm in Philadelphia 
 which expended itself in &quot; The Emigrant s Farewell.&quot; 
 After this was sent off she felt considerably relieved. 
 My symptoms have been of a less acute kind, but, I 
 fear, more enduring. There ! the tea-bell rings. Too 
 bad ! I was just going to say something bright. Now 
 to take your letter and run ! How they will stare when 
 I produce it ! 
 
 After tea. Well, we have had a fine time. When 
 supper was about half over, Catherine began : &quot; We 
 have a dessert that we have been saving all the after 
 noon,&quot; and then I held up my letter. &quot; See here, this 
 is from Hartford ! &quot; I wish you could have seen Aunt 
 Esther s eyes brighten, and mother s pale face all in a 
 smile, and father, as I unfolded the letter and began. 
 Mrs. Parsons s notice of her Thanksgiving predicament 
 caused just a laugh, and then one or two sighs (I told 
 you we were growing sentimental !). We did talk 
 

<page 92>
DR. DRAKE. 63 
 
 some of keeping it (Thanksgiving), but perhaps we 
 should all have felt something of the text, &quot; How shall 
 we sing the Lord s song in a strange land ? &quot; Your 
 praises of Aunt Esther I read twice in an audible voice, 
 as the children made some noise the first time. I think 
 I detected a visible blush, though she found at that 
 time a great deal to do in spreading bread and butter 
 for James, and shuffling his plate ; and, indeed, it was 
 rather a vehement attack on her humility, since it gave 
 her at least &quot; angelic perfection,&quot; if not &quot; Adamic &quot; (to 
 use Methodist technics). Jamie began his Sunday- 
 school career yesterday. The superintendent asked 
 him how old he was. &quot; I m four years old now, and 
 when it snows very hard I shall be five,&quot; he answered. 
 I have just been trying to make him interpret his 
 meaning ; but he says, &quot; Oh, I said so because I could 
 not think of anything else to say.&quot; By the by, Mary, 
 speaking of the temptations of cities, I have much 
 solicitude on Jamie s account lest he should form im 
 proper intimacies, for yesterday or day before we saw 
 him parading by the house with his arm over the neck 
 of a great hog, apparently on the most amicable terms 
 possible ; and the other day he actually got upon the 
 back of one, and rode some distance. So much for 
 allowing these animals to promenade the streets, a par 
 ticular in which Mrs. Cincinnati has imitated the do 
 mestic arrangements of some of her elder sisters, and a 
 very disgusting one it is. 
 
 Our family physician is one Dr. Drake, a man of a 
 good deal of science, theory, and reputed skill, but a 
 sort of general mark for the opposition of all the med 
 ical cloth of the city. He is a tall, rectangular, per- 
 

<page 93>
64 CINCINNATI. 
 
 pendicular sort of a body, as stiff as a poker, and 
 enunciates his prescriptions very much as though he 
 were delivering a discourse on the doctrine of election. 
 The other evening he was detained from visiting Kate, 
 and he sent a very polite, ceremonious note containing 
 a prescription, with Dr. D. s compliments to Miss 
 Beecher, requesting that she would take the inclosed 
 in a little molasses at nine o clock precisely. 
 
 The house we are at present inhabiting is the most 
 inconvenient, ill-arranged, good-for-nothing, and alto 
 gether to be execrated affair that ever was put together. 
 It was evidently built without a thought of a winter 
 season. The kitchen is so disposed that it cannot be 
 reached from any part of the house without going out 
 into the air. Mother is actually obliged to put on a 
 bonnet and cloak every time she goes into it. In the 
 house are two parlors with folding doors between them. 
 The back parlor has but one window, which opens on 
 a veranda and has its lower half painted to keep out 
 what little light there is. I need scarcely add that our 
 landlord is an old bachelor and of course acted up to 
 the light he had, though he left little enough of it for 
 his tenants. 
 
 During this early Cincinnati life Harriet suffered 
 much from ill-health accompanied by great mental de 
 pression ; but in spite of both she labored diligently 
 with her sister Catherine in establishing their school. 
 They called it the Western Female Institute, and pro 
 posed to conduct it upon the college plan, with a fac 
 ulty of instructors. As all these things are treated at 
 length in letters written by Mrs. Stowe to her friend, 
 

<page 94>
WALNUT HILLS. 65 
 
 Miss Georgiana May, we cannot do better than turn 
 to them. In May, 1833, she writes : 
 
 &quot;Bishop Purcell visited our school to-day and ex 
 pressed himself as greatly pleased that we had opened 
 such an one here. He spoke of my poor little geogra 
 phy, 1 and thanked me for the unprejudiced manner in 
 which I had handled the Catholic question in it. I 
 was of course flattered that he should have known any 
 thing of the book. 
 
 &quot; How I wish you could see Walnut Hills. It is 
 about two miles from the city, and the road to it is as 
 picturesque as you can imagine a road to be without 
 springs that run among the hills/ Every possible 
 variety of hill and vale of beautiful slope, and undu 
 lations of land set off by velvet richness of turf and 
 broken up by groves and forests of every outline of 
 foliage, make the scene Arcadian. You might ride 
 over the same road a dozen times a day un tired, for 
 the constant variation of view caused by ascending 
 and descending hills relieves you from all tedium. 
 Much of the wooding is beech of a noble growth. The 
 straight, beautiful shafts of these trees as one looks up 
 the cool green recesses of the woods seems as though 
 they might form very proper columns for a Dryad tem 
 ple. There ! Catherine is growling at me for sitting 
 up so late ; so adieu to music, moonlight, and you. I 
 meant to tell you an abundance of classical things that 
 I have been thinking to-night, but ( woe s me. 
 
 1 This geography was begun by Mrs. Stowe during the summer of 
 1832, while visiting her brother William at Newport, R. I. It was com 
 pleted during the winter of 1833, and published by the firm of Corey, 
 Fairbank & Webster, of Cincinnati.

 &quot; Since writing the above my whole time has been 
 taken up in the labor of our new school, or wasted in 
 the fatigue and lassitude following such labor. To-day 
 is Sunday, and I am staying at home because I think 
 it is time to take some efficient means to dissipate the 
 illness and bad feelings of divers kinds that have for 
 some time been growing upon me. At present there 
 is and can be very little system or regularity about me. 
 About half of my time I am scarcely alive, and a great 
 part of the rest the slave and sport of morbid feeling 
 and unreasonable prejudice. I have everything but 
 good health. 
 
 &quot; I still rejoice that this letter will find you in good 
 old Connecticut thrice blessed - - oh, had I the 
 wings of a dove I would be there too. Give my love 
 to Mary H. I remember well how gently she used to 
 speak to and smile on that forlorn old daddy that 
 boarded at your house one summer. It was associating 
 with her that first put into my head the idea of saying 
 something to people who were not agreeable, and of 
 saying something when I had nothing to say, as is gen 
 erally the case on such occasions. &quot;J 
 
 Again she writes to the same friend : &quot; Your letter, 
 my dear G., I have just received, and read through 
 three times. Now for my meditations upon it. What 
 a woman of the world you are grown. How good it 
 would be for me to be put into a place which so breaks 
 up and precludes thought. Thought, intense emotional 
 thought, has been my disease. How much good it 
 might do me to be where I could not but be thought 
 less. . . . 
 
 &quot; Now, Georgiana, let me copy for your delectation 
 

<page 96>
INTENSITY OF FEELING. 67 
 
 a list of matters that I have jotted down for considera 
 tion at a teachers meeting to be held to-morrow night. 
 It runneth as follows. Just hear ! About quills and 
 paper on the floor; forming classes; drinking in the 
 entry (cold water, mind you) ; giving leave to speak ; 
 recess-bell, etc., etc. You are tired, I see, says Gil- 
 pin, * so am I, and I spare you. 
 
 &quot; I have just been hearing a class of little girls re 
 cite, and telling them a fairy story which I had to spin 
 out as it went along, beginning with once upon a time 
 there was, etc., in the good old-fashioned way of stories. 
 
 &quot; Recently I have been reading the life of Madame 
 de Stael and &amp;lt; Corinne. I have felt an intense sympathy 
 with many parts of that book, with many parts of her 
 character. But in America feelings vehement and 
 absorbing like hers become still more deep, morbid, 
 and impassioned by the constant habits of self-govern 
 ment which the rigid forms of our society demand. 
 They are repressed, and they burn inward till they 
 burn the very soul, leaving only dust and ashes. It 
 seems to me the intensity with which my mind has 
 thought and felt on every subject presented to it has 
 had this effect. It has withered and exhausted it, and 
 though young I have no sympathy with the feelings of 
 youth. All that is enthusiastic, all that is impassioned 
 in admiration of nature, of writing, of character, in 
 devotional thought and emotion, or in the emotions of 
 affection, I have felt with vehement and absorbing 
 intensity, felt till my mind is exhausted, and seems 
 to be sinking into deadness. Half of my time I am 
 glad to remain in a listless vacancy, to busy myself 
 with trifles, since thought is pain, and emotion is pain.&quot; 
 

<page 97>
68 CINCINNATI. 
 
 During the winter of 183334: the young school 
 teacher became so distressed at her own mental listless- 
 ness that she made a vigorous effort to throw it off. 
 She forced herself to mingle in society, and, stimulated 
 by the offer of a prize of fifty dollars by Mr. James 
 Hall, editor of the &quot; Western Monthly,&quot; a newly estab 
 lished magazine, for the best short story, she entered 
 into the competition. Her story, which was entitled 
 &quot; Uncle Lot/ afterwards republished in the &quot; May 
 flower,&quot; was by far the best submitted, and was 
 awarded the prize without hesitation. This success 
 gave a new direction to her thoughts, gave her an in 
 sight into her own ability, and so encouraged her that 
 from that time on she devoted most of her leisure 
 moments to writing. 
 
 Her literary efforts were further stimulated at this 
 time by the congenial society of the Semi-Colon Club, 
 a little social circle that met on alternate weeks at Mr. 
 Samuel Foote s and Dr. Drake s. The name of the 
 club originated with a roundabout and rather weak bit 
 of logic set forth by one of its promoters. He said : 
 &quot; You know that in Spanish Columbus is called Colon. 
 Now he who discovers a new pleasure is certainly half 
 as great as he who discovers a new continent. There 
 fore if Colon discovered a continent, we who have dis 
 covered in this club a new pleasure should at least be 
 entitled to the name of Semi-Colons. So Semi- 
 Colons they became and remained for some years. 
 
 At some meetings compositions were read, and at 
 others nothing was read, but the time was passed in a 
 general discussion of some interesting topic previously 
 announced. Among the members of the club were 
 

<page 98>
THE SEMI-COLON CLUB. 69 
 
 Professor Stowe, unsurpassed in Biblical learning; 
 Judge James Hall, editor of the &quot; Western Monthly ; &quot; 
 General Edward King,; Mrs. Peters, afterwards founder 
 of the Philadelphia School of Design ; Miss Catherine 
 Beecher ; Mrs. Caroline Lee Hentz ; E. P. Cranch ; 
 Dr. Drake ; S. P. Chase, and many others who after 
 wards became prominent in their several walks of life. 
 
 In one of her letters to Miss May, Mrs. Stowe de 
 scribes one of her methods for entertaining the mem 
 bers of the Semi-Colon as follows : 
 
 &quot; I am wondering as to what I shall do next. I 
 have been writing a piece to be read next Monday 
 evening at Uncle Sam s soiree (the Semi-Colon). It is 
 a letter purporting to be from Dr. Johnson. I have 
 been stilting about in his style so long that it is a relief 
 to me to come down to the jog of common English. 
 Now I think of it I will just give you a history of my 
 campaign in this circle. 
 
 &quot; My first piece was a letter from Bishop Butler, 
 written in his outrageous style of parentheses and fog- 
 gification. My second a satirical essay on the modern 
 uses of languages. This I shall send to you, as some 
 of the gentlemen, it seems, took a fancy to it and 
 requested leave to put it in the Western Magazine, 
 and so it is in print. It is ascribed to Catherine, or I 
 don t know that I should have let it go. I have no 
 notion of appearing in propria personce. 
 
 &quot; The next piece was a satire on certain members 
 who were getting very much into the way of joking 
 on the worn-out subjects of matrimony and old maid 
 and old bachelorism. I therefore wrote a set of legis 
 lative enactments purporting to be from the ladies of 
 

<page 99>
70 CINCINNATI. 
 
 the society, forbidding all such allusions in future. It 
 made some sport at the time. I try not to be personal, 
 and to be courteous, even in satire. 
 
 &quot;But I have written a piece this week that is mak 
 ing me some disquiet. I did not like it that there was 
 so little that was serious and rational about the reading. 
 So I conceived the design of writing a set of letters, 
 and throwing them in, as being the letters of a friend. 
 I wrote a letter this week for the first of the set, 
 easy, not very sprightly, describing an imaginary 
 situation, a house in the country, a gentleman and 
 lady, Mr. and Mrs. Howard, as being pious, literary, 
 and agreeable. I threw into the letter a number of 
 little particulars and incidental allusions to give it the 
 air of having been really a letter. I meant thus to 
 give myself an opportunity for the introduction of dif 
 ferent subjects and the discussion of different charac 
 ters in future letters. 
 
 &quot; I meant to write on a great number of subjects in 
 future. Cousin Elisabeth, only, was in the secret ; 
 Uncle Samuel and Sarah Elliot were not to know. 
 
 &quot; Yesterday morning I finished my letter, smoked it 
 to make it look yellow, tore it to make it look old, 
 directed it and scratched out the direction, postmarked 
 it with red ink, sealed it and broke the seal, all this to 
 give credibility to the fact of its being a real letter. 
 Then I inclosed it in an envelope, stating that it was 
 a part of a set which had incidentally fallen into my 
 hands. This envelope was written in a scrawny, 
 scrawly, gentleman s hand. 
 
 &quot; I put it into the office in the morning, directed to 
 6 Mrs. Samuel E. Foote/ and then sent word to Sis that 
 

<page 100>
UNCLE TOM S CABIN. 71 
 
 it was coming, so that she might be ready to enact the 
 part. 
 
 &quot; Well, the deception took. Uncle Sam examined it 
 and pronounced, ex cathedra, that it must have been 
 a real letter. Mr. Greene (the gentleman who reads) 
 declared that it must have come from Mrs. Hall, and 
 elucidated the theory by spelling out the names and 
 dates which I had erased, which, of course, he accom 
 modated to his own tastes. But then, what makes me 
 f eel % uneasy is that Elisabeth, after reading it, did not 
 seem to be exactly satisfied. She thought it had too 
 much sentiment, too much particularity of incident, - 
 she did not exactly know what. She was afraid that it 
 would be criticised unmercifully. Now Elisabeth has 
 a tact and quickness of perception that I trust to, and 
 her remarks have made me uneasy enough. I am 
 unused to being criticised, and don t know how I shall 
 bear it.&quot; 
 
 In 1833 Mrs. Stowe first had the subject of slavery 
 brought to her personal notice by taking a trip across 
 the river from Cincinnati into Kentucky in company 
 with Miss Button, one of the associate teachers in the 
 Western Institute. They visited an estate that after 
 wards figured as that of Colonel Shelby in &quot; Uncle 
 Tom s Cabin,&quot; and here the young authoress first came 
 into personal contact with the negro slaves of the 
 South. In speaking, many years afterwards, of this 
 visit, Miss Button said : &quot; Harriet did not seem to 
 notice anything in particular that happened, but sat 
 much of the time as though abstracted in thought. 
 When the negroes did funny things and cut up capers, 
 she did not seem to pay the slightest attention to them. 
 

<page 101>
72 CINCINNATI. 
 
 Afterwards, however, in reading Uncle Tom/ I rec 
 ognized scene after scene of that visit portrayed with 
 the most minute fidelity, and knew at once where the 
 material for that portion of the story had been gath 
 ered.&quot; 
 
 At this time, however, Mrs. Stowe was more deeply 
 interested in the subject of education than in that of 
 slavery, as is shown by the following extract from one 
 of her letters to Miss May, who was herself a teacher. 
 She says : 
 
 &quot; We mean to turn over the West by means of 
 model schools in this, its capital. We mean to have a 
 young lady s school of about fifty or sixty, a primary 
 school of little girls to the same amount, and then a 
 primary school for boys. We have come to the conclu 
 sion that the work of teaching will never be rightly 
 done till it passes into female hands. This is espe 
 cially true with regard to boys. To govern boys by 
 moral influences requires tact and talent and versatil 
 ity; it requires also the same division of labor that 
 female education does. But men of tact, versatility, 
 talent, and piety will not devote their lives to teaching. 
 They must be ministers and missionaries, and all that, 
 and while there is such a thrilling call for action in this 
 way, every man w r ho is merely teaching feels as if he 
 were a Hercules wi^h a distaff, ready t,o spring to the 
 first trumpet that calls him away. As for division of 
 labor, men must have salaries that can support wife 
 and family, and, of course, a revenue would be required 
 to support a requisite number of teachers if they could 
 be found. 
 
 &quot; Then, if men have more knowledge they have less 
 
 r 
 

<page 102>
VISITS THE EAST. 73 
 
 talent at communicating it, nor have they the patience, 
 the long-suffering, and gentleness necessary to superin 
 tend the formation of character. We intend to make 
 these principles understood, and ourselves to set the 
 example of what females can do in this way. You see 
 that first-rate talent is necessary for all that we mean 
 to do, especially for the last, because here we must face 
 down the prejudices of society and we must have ex 
 emplary success to be believed. We want original, 
 planning minds, and you do not know how few there 
 are among females, and how few we can command of 
 those that exist.&quot; 
 
 During the summer of 1834 the young teacher and 
 writer made her first visit East since leaving New Eng 
 land two years before. Its object was mainly to be 
 present at the graduation of her favorite brother, Henry 
 Ward, from Amherst College. The earlier part of this 
 journey was performed by means of stage to Toledo, 
 and thence by steamer to Buffalo. A pleasant bit of 
 personal description, and also of impressions of Niagara, 
 seen for the first time on this journey, are given in a 
 letter sent back to Cincinnati during its progress. In 
 it she says of her fellow- travelers : 
 
 &quot; Then there was a portly, rosy, clever Mr. Smith, or 
 Jones, or something the like ; and a New Orleans girl 
 looking like distraction, as far as dress is concerned, but 
 with the prettiest language and softest intonations in 
 the world, and one of those faces which, while you say 
 it is n t handsome, keeps you looking all the time to see 
 what it can be that is so pretty about it. Then there 
 was Miss B., an independent, good-natured, do-as-I- 
 please sort of a body, who seemed of perpetual motion 
 

<page 103>
74 CINCINNATI. 
 
 from morning till night. Poor Miss D. said, when we 
 stopped at night, Oh, dear ! I suppose Lydia will be 
 fiddling about our room till morning, and we shall not 
 one of us sleep. Then, by way of contrast, there was 
 a Mr. Mitchell, the most gentlemanly, obliging man 
 that ever changed his seat forty times a day to please 
 a lady. Oh, yes, he could ride outside, or, oh, cer 
 tainly, he could ride inside, he had no objection to 
 this, or that, or the other. Indeed, it was difficult to 
 say what could come amiss to him. He speaks in a 
 soft, quiet manner, with something of a drawl, using 
 very correct, well-chosen language, and pronouncing all 
 his words with carefulness ; has everything in his dress 
 and traveling appointments comme ilfaut; and seems 
 to think there is abundant time for everything that 
 is to be done in this world, without, as he says, * any 
 unnecessary excitement/ Before the party had fully 
 discovered his name he was usually designated as the 
 obliging gentleman/ or that gentleman who is so ac 
 commodating. Yet our friend, withal, is of Irish ex 
 traction, and I have seen him roused to talk with both 
 hands and a dozen words in a breath. He fell into a 
 little talk about abolition and slavery with our good 
 Mr. Jones, a man whose mode of reasoning consists in 
 repeating the same sentence at regular intervals as long 
 as you choose to answer it. This man, who was finally 
 convinced that negroes were black, used it as an irre- 
 fragible argument to all that could be said, and at last 
 began to deduce from it that they might just as well be 
 slaves as anything else, and so he proceeded till all the 
 philanthropy of our friend was roused, and he sprung 
 up all lively and oratorical and gesticulatory and indig- 
 

<page 104>

 nant to my heart s content. I like to see a quiet man 
 that can be roused.&quot; 
 
 In the same letter she gives her impressions of 
 Niagara, as follows : 
 
 &quot; I have seen it (Niagara) and yet live. Oh, where 
 is your soul ? Never mind, though. Let me tell, if I 
 can, what is unutterable. Elisabeth, it is not like any 
 thing ; it did not look like anything I expected ; it did 
 not look like a waterfall. I did not once think whether 
 it was high or low ; whether it roared or did n t roar ; 
 whether it equaled my expectations or not. My mind 
 whirled off, it seemed to me, in a new, strange world. 
 It seemed unearthly, like the strange, dim images in 
 the Revelation. I thought of the great white throne ; 
 the rainbow around it ; the throne in sight like unto an 
 emerald ; and oh ! that beautiful water rising like moon 
 light, falling as the soul sinks when it dies, to rise re 
 fined, spiritualized, and pure. That rainbow, breaking 
 out, trembling, fading, and again coming like a beauti 
 ful spirit walking the waters. Oh, it is lovelier than it 
 is great ; it is like the Mind that made it : great, but so 
 veiled in beauty that we gaze without terror. I felt as 
 if I could have gone over with the waters ; it would 
 be so beautiful a death ; there would be no fear in it. 
 I felt the rock tremble under me with a sort of joy. 
 I was so maddened that I could have gone too, if it had 
 gone.&quot; 
 
 While at the East she was greatly affected by hearing 
 of the death of her dear friend, Eliza Tyler, the wife 
 of Professor Stowe. This lady was the daughter of 
 Dr. Bennett Tyler, president of the Theological Insti 
 tute of Connecticut, at East Windsor ; but twenty-five 
 

<page 105>
76 CINCINNA TL 
 
 years of age at the time of her death, a very beautiful 
 woman gifted with a wonderful voice. She was also 
 possessed of a well-stored mind and a personal mag 
 netism that made her one of the most popular members 
 of the Semi-Colon Club, in the proceedings of which 
 she took an active interest. 
 
 Her death left Professor Stowe a childless widower, 
 and his forlorn condition greatly excited the sympathy 
 of her who had been his wife s most intimate friend. 
 It was easy for sympathy to ripen into love, and after a 
 short engagement Harriet E. Beecher became the wife 
 of Professor Calvin E. Stowe. 
 
 Her last act before the wedding was to write the fol 
 lowing note to the friend of her girlhood, Miss Georgi- 
 ana May : 
 
 January 6, 1836. 
 
 Well, my dear G., about half an hour more and your 
 old friend, companion, schoolmate, sister, etc., will cease 
 to be Hatty Beecher and change to nobody knows who. 
 My dear, you are engaged, and pledged in a year or two 
 to encounter a similar fate, and do you wish to know 
 how you shall feel ? Well, my dear, I have been dread 
 ing and dreading the time, and lying awake all last 
 week wondering how I should live through this over 
 whelming crisis, and lo ! it has come and I feel nothing 
 at all. 
 
 The wedding is to be altogether domestic ; nobody 
 present but my own brothers and sisters, and my old 
 colleague, Mary Button ; and as there is a sufficiency 
 of the ministry in our family we have not even to call 
 in the foreign aid of a minister. Sister Katy is not 
 here, so she will not witness my departure from her care 
 

<page 106>

 and guidance to that of another. None of my numer 
 ous friends and acquaintances who have taken such a 
 deep interest in making the connection for me even 
 know the day, and it will be all done and over before 
 they know anything about it. 
 
 Well, it is really a mercy to have this entire stupidity 
 come over one at such a time. I should be crazy to feel 
 as I did yesterday, or indeed to feel anything at all. 
 But I inwardly vowed that my last feelings and reflec 
 tions on this subject should be yours, and as I have not 
 got any, it is just as well to tell you that. Well, here 
 comes Mr. S., so farewell, and for the last time I sub 
 scribe Your own

 THE letter to her friend Georgiana May, begun half 
 an hour before her wedding, was not completed until 
 nearly two months after that event. * Taking it from 
 her portfolio, she adds : 
 
 &quot; Three weeks have passed since writing the above, 
 and my husband and self are now quietly seated by our 
 own fireside, as domestic as any pair of tame fowl you 
 ever saw ; he writing to his mother, and I to you. Two 
 days after our marriage we took a wedding excursion, 
 so called, though we would most gladly have been ex 
 cused this conformity to ordinary custom had not neces 
 sity required Mr. Stowe to visit Columbus, and I had 
 too much adhesiveness not to go too. Ohio roads at 
 this season are no joke, I can tell you, though we were, 
 on the whole, wonderfully taken care of, and our expe 
 dition Included as many pleasures as an expedition at 
 this time of the year ever could. 
 
 &quot; And now, my dear, perhaps the wonder to you, as 
 to me, is how this momentous crisis in the life of such 
 a wisp of nerve as myself has been transacted so qui-

 etly. My dear, it is a wonder to myself. I am tran 
 quil, quiet, and happy. I look only on the present, 
 and leave the future with Him who has hitherto been 
 so kind to me. Take no thought for the morrow is 
 my motto, and my comfort is to rest on Him in whose 
 house there are many mansions provided when these 
 fleeting earthly ones pass away. 
 
 &quot; Dear Georgy, naughty girl that I am, it is a month 
 that I have let the above lie by, because I got into a 
 strain of emotion in it that I dreaded to return to. 
 Well, so it shall be no longer. In about five weeks 
 Mr. Stowe and myself start for New England. He 
 sails the first of May. I am going with him to Boston, 
 New York, and other places, and shall stop finally at 
 Hartford, whence, as soon as he is gone, it is my inten 
 tion to return westward.&quot; 
 
 This reference to her husband as about to leave her 
 relates to his sailing for Europe to purchase books for 
 Lane Seminary, and also as a commissioner appointed 
 by the State of Ohio to investigate the public school 
 systems of the old world. He had long been convinced 
 that higher education was impossible in the West with 
 out a higher grade of public schools, and had in 1833 
 been one of the founders in Cincinnati of &quot; The Col 
 lege of Teachers,&quot; an institution that existed for ten 
 years, and exerted a widespread influence. Its objects 
 were to popularize the common schools, raise the stand 
 ard of teachers, and create a demand for education 
 among the people. Professor Stowe was associated in 
 this movement with many of the leading intellects of 
 Ohio at that time, and among them were Albert Pickett, 
 Dr. Drake, Smith Grimke, Archbishop Purcell, Presi-

 dent A. H. McGuffey, Dr. Beecher, Lydia Sigourney, 
 Caroline Lee Hentz, and others. Their influence finally 
 extended to the state legislature, and it was concluded 
 to authorize Professor Stowe, when abroad, to investi 
 gate and report upon the common school systems of 
 Europe, especially Prussia. 
 
 He sailed from New York for London in the ship 
 Montreal, Captain Champlin, on June 8, 1836, and 
 carried with him, to be opened only after he was at 
 sea, a letter from his wife, from which the following 
 extract is made : 
 
 66 Now, my dear, that you are gone where you are 
 out of the reach of my care, advice, and good manage 
 ment, it is fitting that you should have something 
 under my hand and seal for your comfort and further 
 ance in the new world you are going to. Firstly, I 
 must caution you to set your face as a flint against the 
 cultivation of indigo, as Elisabeth calls it, in any way 
 or shape. Keep yourself from it most scrupulously, 
 and though you are unprovided with that precious and 
 savory treatise entitled Kemper s Consolations, l yet 
 you can exercise yourself to recall and set in order such 
 parts thereof as would more particularly suit your case, 
 particularly those portions wherewith you so much con 
 soled Kate, Aunt Esther, and your unworthy hand 
 maid, while you yet tarried at Walnut Hills. But seri 
 ously, dear one, you must give more way to hope than 
 to memory. You are going to a new scene now, and 
 one that I hope will be full of enjoyment to you. I 
 want you to take the good of it. 
 
 &quot; Only think of all you expect to see : the great 
 
 1 A ridiculous book from which Mr. Stowe derived endless amusement.

 libraries and beautiful paintings, fine churches, and, 
 above all, think of seeing Tholuck, your great Apollo. 
 My dear, I wish I were a man in your place ; if I 
 would n t have a grand time ! &quot; 
 
 During her husband s absence abroad Mrs. Stowe 
 lived quietly in Cincinnati with her father and broth 
 ers. She wrote occasionally short stories, articles, and 
 essays for publication in the &quot; Western Monthly Maga 
 zine &quot; or the &quot; New York Evangelist,&quot; and maintained 
 a constant correspondence with her husband by means 
 of a daily journal, which was forwarded to him once a 
 month. She also assisted her brother, Henry Ward, 
 who had accepted a temporary position as editor of the 
 &quot; Journal,&quot; a small daily paper published in the city. 
 
 At this time the question of slavery was an exciting 
 one in Cincinnati, and Lane Seminary had become a 
 hotbed of abolition. The anti-slavery movement among 
 the students was headed by Theodore D. Weld, ono of 
 their number, who had procured funds to complete his 
 education by lecturing through the South. While 
 thus engaged he had been so impressed with the evils 
 and horrors of slavery that he had become a radical 
 abolitionist, and had succeeded in converting several 
 Southerners to his views of the subject. Among them 
 was Mr. J. G. Birney of Huntsville, Alabama, who not 
 only liberated his slaves, but in connection with Dr. 
 Gamaliel Bailey of Cincinnati founded in that city an 
 anti-slavery paper called &quot; The Philanthropist.&quot; This 
 paper was finally suppressed, and its office wrecked by 
 a mob instigated by Kentucky slaveholders, and it is of 
 this event that Mrs. Stowe writes to her husband as 
 follows : 
 

<page 111>
82 B EARLY MARRIED LIFE. 
 
 &quot; Yesterday evening I spent scribbling for Henry s 
 newspaper (the Journal ) in this wise : Birney s print 
 ing-press has been mobbed, and many of the respect 
 able citizens are disposed to wink at the outrage in con 
 sideration of its moving in the line of their prejudices/ 
 
 &quot; I wrote a conversational sketch, in which I rather 
 satirized this inconsistent spirit, and brought out the 
 effects of patronizing any violation of private rights. 
 It was in a light, sketchy style, designed to draw atten 
 tion to a long editorial of Henry s in which he consid 
 ers the subject fully and seriously. His piece is, I 
 think, a powerful one ; indeed, he does write very 
 strongly. I am quite proud of his editorials ; they are 
 well studied, earnest, and dignified. I think he will 
 make a first-rate writer. Both our pieces have gone to 
 press to-day, with Charles s article on music, and we 
 have had not a little diversion about our family news 
 paper. 
 
 &quot;I thought, when I was writing last night, that I 
 was, like a good wife, defending one of your principles 
 in your absence, and wanted you to see how manfully I 
 talked about it. Henry has also taken up and exam 
 ined the question of the Seminole Indians, and done it 
 yery nobly.&quot; 
 
 Again : 
 
 &quot; The excitement about Birney continues to increase. 
 The keeper of the Franklin Hotel was assailed by a 
 document subscribed to by many of his boarders de 
 manding that Birney should be turned out of doors. 
 He chose to negative the demand, and twelve of his 
 boarders immediately left, Dr. F. among the number. 
 A meeting has been convoked by means of a handbill, 
 

<page 112>
A PRO-SLAVERY MEETING. 83 
 
 in which some of the most respectable men of the city 
 are invited by name to come together and consider the 
 question whether they will allow Mr. Birney to con 
 tinue his paper in the city. Mr. Greene says that, to 
 his utter surprise, many of the most respectable and 
 influential citizens gave out that they should go. 
 
 &quot;He was one of the number they invited, but he 
 told those who came to him that he would have noth 
 ing to do with disorderly public meetings or mobs in 
 any shape, and that he was entirely opposed to the 
 whole thing. 
 
 &quot;I presume they will have a hot meeting, if they 
 have any at all. 
 
 &quot; I wish father were at home to preach a sermon to 
 his church, for many of its members do not frown on 
 these things as they ought.&quot; 
 
 &quot; Later : The meeting was held, and was headed by 
 Morgan, Neville, Judge Burke, and I know not who 
 else. Judge Burnet was present and consented to 
 their acts. The mob madness is certainly upon this 
 city when men of sense and standing will pass resolu 
 tions approving in so many words of things done con 
 trary to law, as one of the resolutions of this meeting 
 did. It quoted the demolition of the tea in Boston 
 harbor as being authority and precedent. 
 
 &quot; A large body, perhaps the majority of citizens, dis 
 approve, but I fear there will not be public disavowal. 
 Even N. Wright but faintly opposes, and Dr. Fore has 
 been exceedingly violent. Mr. Hammond (editor of 
 the f Gazette ) in a very dignified and judicious man 
 ner has condemned the whole thing, and Henry has 
 opposed, but otherwise the papers have either been 
 

<page 113>
84 EARLY MARRIED LIFE. 
 
 silent or in favor of mobs. We shall see what the 
 result will be in a few days. 
 
 &quot; For my part, I can easily see how such proceedings 
 may make converts to abolitionism, for already my 
 sympathies are strongly enlisted for Mr. Birney, and I 
 hope that he will stand his ground and assert his rights. 
 The office is fire-proof, and inclosed by high walls. I 
 wish he would man it with armed men and see what can 
 be done. If I were a man I would go, for one, and 
 take good care of at least one window. Henry sits 
 opposite me writing a most valiant editorial, and tells 
 me to tell you he is waxing mighty in battle.&quot; 
 
 In another letter she writes : 
 
 &quot; I told you in my last that the mob broke into Bir- 
 ney s press, where, however, the mischief done was but 
 slight. The object appeared to be principally to ter 
 rify. Immediately there followed a general excitement 
 in which even good men in their panic and prejudice 
 about abolitionism forgot that mobs were worse evils 
 than these, talked against Birney, and winked at the 
 outrage ; N. Wright and Judge Burnet, for example. 
 Meanwhile the turbulent spirits went beyond this and 
 talked of revolution and of righting things without law 
 that could not be righted by it. At the head of these 
 were Morgan, Neville, Longworth, Joseph Graham, 
 and Judge Burke. A meeting was convoked at Lower 
 Market Street to decide whether they would permit the 
 publishing of an abolition paper, and to this meeting 
 all the most respectable citizens were by name sum 
 moned. 
 
 &quot; There were four classes in the city then : Those 
 who meant to go as revolutionists and support the 
 

<page 114>
THE RIOTS. 85 
 
 mob ; those who meant to put down Birney, but rather 
 hoped to do it without a mob ; those who felt ashamed 
 to go, foreseeing the probable consequence, and yet did 
 not decidedly frown upon it; and those who sternly 
 and decidedly reprehended it. 
 
 &quot; The first class was headed by Neville, Longworth, 
 Graham, etc. ; the second class, though of some num 
 bers, was less conspicuous ; of the third, Judge Burnet, 
 Dr. Fore, and N. Wright were specimens ; and in the 
 last such men as Hammond, Mansfield, S. P. Chase, 1 
 and Chester were prominent. The meeting in so many 
 words voted a mob, nevertheless a committee was ap 
 pointed to wait on Mr. Birney and ascertain what he 
 proposed to do ; and, strange to tell, men as sensible as 
 Uncle John and Judge Burnet were so short-sighted as 
 to act on that committee. 
 
 &quot; All the newspapers in the city, except Hammond s 
 ( Gazette ) and Henry s (the f Journal ), were either 
 silent or openly c mobocratic. As might have been 
 expected, Birney refused to leave, and that night the 
 mob tore down his press, scattered the types, dragged 
 the whole to the river, threw it in, and then came back 
 to demolish the office. 
 
 &quot; They then went to the houses of Dr. Bailey, Mr. 
 Donaldson, and Mr. Birney ; but the persons they 
 sought were not at home, having been aware of what 
 was intended. The mayor was a silent spectator of 
 these proceedings, and was heard to say, * Well, lads, 
 you have done well, so far ; go home now before you 
 disgrace yourselves ; but the lads spent the rest of 
 the night and a greater part of the next day (Sunday) 
 
 1 Salmon P. Chase. 
 

<page 115>
86 EARLY MARRIED LIFE. 
 
 in pulling down the houses of inoffensive and respecta 
 ble blacks. The Gazette office was threatened, the 
 c Journal office was to go next ; Lane Seminary and 
 the water-works also were mentioned as probable points 
 to be attacked by the mob. 
 
 &quot;By Tuesday morning the city was pretty well 
 alarmed. A regular corps of volunteers was organ 
 ized, who for three nights patrolled the streets with 
 firearms and with legal warrant from the mayor, who 
 by this time was glad to give it, to put down the mob 
 even by bloodshed. 
 
 &quot; For a day or two we did not know but there would 
 actually be war to the knife, as was threatened by the 
 mob, and we really saw Henry depart with his pistols 
 with daily alarm, only we were all too full of patriotism 
 not to have sent every brother we had rather than not 
 have had the principles of freedom and order defended. 
 
 &quot; But here the tide turned. The mob, unsupported 
 by a now frightened community, slunk into their dens 
 and were still ; and then Hammond, who, during the 
 few days of its prevalence, had made no comments, 
 but published simply the Sermon on the Mount, the 
 Constitution of Ohio, and the Declaration of Independ 
 ence, without any comment, now came out and gave a 
 simple, concise history of the mob, tracing it to the 
 market-house meeting, telling the whole history of the 
 meeting, with the names of those who got it up, throw 
 ing on them and on those who had acted on the com 
 mittee the whole responsibility of the following mob. 
 It makes a terrible sensation, but it cuts its way, and 
 all who took other stand than that of steady opposition 
 from the first are beginning to feel the reaction of pub- 
 

<page 116>
GROWTH OF ABOLITION SENTIMENT. 87 
 
 lie sentiment, while newspapers from abroad are pour 
 ing in their reprehensions of the disgraceful conduct 
 of Cincinnati. Another time, I suspect, such men as 
 Judge Burnet, Mr. Greene, and Uncle John will keep 
 their fingers out of such a trap, and people will all 
 learn better than to wink at a mob that happens to 
 please them at the outset, or in any way to give it their 
 countenance. Mr. Greene and Uncle John were full 
 of wrath against mobs, and would not go to the meet 
 ing, and yet were cajoled into acting on that committee 
 in the vain hope of getting Birney to go away and thus 
 preventing the outrage. 
 
 &quot; They are justly punished, I think, for what was 
 very irresolute and foolish conduct, to say the least.&quot; 
 
 The general tone of her letters at this time would 
 seem to show that, while Mrs. Stowe was anti-slavery 
 in her sympathies, she was not a declared abolitionist. 
 This is still further borne out in a letter written in 
 1837 from Putnam, Ohio, whither she had gone for a 
 short visit to her brother William. In it she says : 
 
 &quot; The good people here, you know, are about half 
 abolitionists. A lady who takes a leading part in 
 the female society in this place yesterday called and 
 brought Catherine the proceedings of the Female Anti- 
 Slavery Convention. 
 
 &quot; I should think them about as ultra as to measures 
 as anything that has been attempted, though I am 
 glad to see a better spirit than marks such proceedings 
 generally. 
 
 &quot; To-day I read some in Mr. Birney s Philanthro 
 pist. Abolitionism being the fashion here, it is nat 
 ural to look at its papers. 
 

<page 117>
88 EARLY MARRIED LIFE. 
 
 &quot; It does seem to me that there needs to be an in 
 termediate society. If not, as light increases, all the 
 excesses of the abolition party will not prevent humane 
 and conscientious men from joining it. 
 
 &quot;Pray what is there in Cincinnati to satisfy one 
 whose mind is awakened on this subject ? No one can 
 have the system of slavery brought before him without 
 an irrepressible desire to do something, and what is 
 there to be done ? &quot; 
 
 On September 29, 1836, while Professor Stowe was 
 still absent in Europe, his wife gave birth to twin 
 daughters, Eliza and Isabella, as she named them ; but 
 Eliza Tyler and Harriet Beecher, as her husband in 
 sisted they should be called, when, upon reaching New 
 York, he was greeted by the joyful news. His trip 
 from London in the ship Gladiator had been unusually 
 long, even for those days of sailing vessels, and ex 
 tended from November 19, 1836, to January 20, 1837. 
 
 During the summer of 1837 Mrs. Stowe suffered 
 much from ill health, on which account, and to relieve 
 her from domestic cares, she was sent to make a 
 long visit at Putnam with her brother, Rev. William 
 Beecher. While here she received a letter from her 
 husband, in which he says : 
 
 &quot;We all of course feel proper indignation at the 
 doings of last General Assembly, and shall treat them 
 with merited contempt. This alliance between the old 
 school (Presbyterians) and slaveholders will make more 
 abolitionists than anything that has been done yet.&quot; 
 
 In December Professor Stowe went to Columbus 
 with the extended educational report that he had de 
 voted the summer to preparing ; and in writing from 
 there to his wife he says : 
 

<page 118>
THE BE EC HER REUNION. 89 
 
 &quot; To-day I have been visiting the governor and leg 
 islators. They received me with the utmost kindness, 
 and are evidently anticipating much from my report. 
 The governor communicated it to the legislature to 
 day, and it is concluded that I read it in Dr. Hodges 
 church on two evenings, to-morrow and the day after, 
 before both houses of the legislature and the citizens. 
 The governor (Vance) will preside at both meetings. 
 I like him (the governor) much. He is just such a 
 plain, simple-hearted, sturdy body as old Fritz (Kai 
 ser Frederick), with more of natural talent than his 
 predecessor in the gubernatorial chair. For my year s 
 work in this matter I am to receive $500.&quot; 
 
 On January 14, 1838, Mrs. Stowe s third child, 
 Henry Ellis, was born. 
 
 It was about this time that the famous reunion of 
 the Beecher family described in Lyman Beecher s 
 &quot; Autobiography &quot; occurred. Edward made a visit to 
 the East, and when he returned he brought Mary 
 (Mrs. Thomas Perkins) from Hartford with him. 
 William came down from Putnam, Ohio, and George 
 from Batavia, New York, while Catherine, Harriet, 
 Henry, Charles, Isabella, Thomas, and James were al 
 ready at home. It was the first time they had ever 
 all met together. Mary had never seen James, and 
 had seen Thomas but once. The old doctor was al 
 most transported with joy as they all gathered about 
 him, and his cup of happiness was filled to overflowing 
 when, the next day, which was Sunday, his pulpit was 
 filled by Edward in the morning, William in the after 
 noon, and George in the evening. J 
 
 Side by side with this charming picture we have

 another of domestic life outlined by Mrs. Stowe s own 
 hand. It is contained in the following letter, written 
 June 21, 1838, to Miss May, at New Haven, Conn. : 
 
 MY DEAR, DEAR GEORGiANA, Only think how 
 long it is since I have written to you, and how changed 
 I am since then the mother of three children ! 
 Well, if I have not kept the reckoning of old times, let 
 this last circumstance prove my apology, for I have 
 been hand, heart, and head full since I saw you. 
 
 &quot; Now, to-day, for example, I 11 tell you what I had 
 on my mind from dawn to dewy eve. In the first 
 place I waked about half after four and thought, 
 &quot; Bless me, how light it is ! I must get out of bed and 
 rap to wake up Mina, for breakfast must be had at 
 six o clock this morning.&quot; So out of bed I jump and 
 seize the tongs and pound, pound, pound over poor 
 Mina s sleepy head, charitably allowing her about half 
 an hour to get waked up in, that being the quantum 
 of time that it takes me, or used to. Well, then 
 baby wakes qua, qua, qua, so I give him his break 
 fast, dozing meanwhile and soliloquizing as follows : 
 &quot; Now I must not forget to tell Mr. Stowe about the 
 starch and dried apples &quot; - doze &quot; ah, um, dear me ! 
 why does n t Mina get up ? I don t hear her,&quot; doze 
 &quot; a, um, I wonder if Mina has soap enough ! I 
 think there were two bars left on Saturday &quot; doze 
 again I wake again. &quot; Dear me, broad daylight ! I 
 must get up and go down and see if Mina is getting 
 breakfast.&quot; Up I jump and up wakes baby. &quot; Now, 
 little boy, be good and let mother dress, because she is 
 in a hurry.&quot; I get my frock half on and baby by that 
 

<page 120>
DOMESTIC TRIALS. 91 
 
 time has kicked himself down off his pillow, and is cry 
 ing and fisting the bed-clothes in great order. I stop with 
 one sleeve off and one on to settle matters with him. 
 Having planted him bolt upright and gone all up and 
 down the chamber barefoot to get pillows and blankets, 
 to prop him up, I finish putting my frock on and hurry 
 down to satisfy myself by actual observation that the 
 breakfast is in progress. Then back I come into the 
 nursery, where, remembering that it is washing day 
 and that there is a great deal of work to be done, I 
 apply myself vigorously to sweeping, dusting, and the 
 setting to rights so necessary where there are three lit 
 tle mischiefs always pulling down as fast as one can 
 put up. 
 
 Then there are Miss H and Miss E , con 
 cerning whom Mary will furnish you with all suitable 
 particulars, who are chattering, hallooing, or singing at 
 the tops of their voices, as may suit their various states 
 of mind, while the nurse is getting their breakfast ready. 
 This meal being cleared away, Mr. Stowe dispatched to 
 market with various memoranda of provisions, etc., and 
 the baby being washed and dressed, I begin to think 
 what next must be done. I start to cut out some little 
 dresses, have just calculated the length and got one 
 breadth torn off when Master Henry makes a doleful 
 lip and falls to crying with might and main. I catch 
 him up and turning round see one of his sisters flour 
 ishing the things out of my workbox in fine style. 
 Moving it away and looking the other side I see the 
 second little mischief seated by the hearth chewing 
 coals and scraping up ashes with great apparent relish. 
 Grandmother lays hold upon her and charitably offers 
 

<page 121>
92 EARLY MARRIED LIFE. 
 
 to endeavor to quiet baby while I go on with my work. 
 I set at it again, pick up a dozen pieces, measure them 
 once more to see which is the right one, and proceed 
 to cut out some others, when I see the twins on the 
 point of quarreling with each other. Number one 
 pushes number two over. Number two screams : that 
 frightens the baby and he joins in. I call number one 
 a naughty girl, take the persecuted one in my arms, 
 and endeavor to comfort her by trotting to the old 
 lyric : 
 
 &quot; So ride the gentlefolk, 
 And so do we, so do we.&quot; 
 
 Meanwhile number one makes her way to the slop jar 
 and forthwith proceeds to wash her apron in it. Grand 
 mother catches her by one shoulder, drags her away, 
 and sets the jar up out of her reach. By and by the 
 nurse comes up from her sweeping. I commit the chil 
 dren to her, and finish cutting out the frocks. 
 
 But let this suffice, for of such details as these are 
 all my days made up. Indeed, my dear, I am but a 
 mere drudge with few ideas beyond babies and house 
 keeping. As for thoughts, reflections, and sentiments, 
 good lack ! good lack ! 
 
 I suppose I am a dojefully uninteresting person at 
 present, but I hope I shall grow young again one of 
 these days, for it seems to me that matters cannot al 
 ways stand exactly as they do now. 
 
 Well, Georgy, this marriage is yes, I will speak 
 well of it, after all ; for when I can stop and think long 
 enough to discriminate my head from my heels, I must 
 say that I think myself a fortunate woman both in hus 
 band and children. My children I would not change 
 

<page 122>
AIDING A FUGITIVE SLAVE, 93 
 
 for all the ease, leisure, and pleasure that I could have 
 without them. They are money on interest whose 
 value will be constantly increasing. J 
 
 In 1839 Mrs. Stowe received into her family as a 
 servant a colored girl from Kentucky. By the laws of 
 Ohio she was free, having been brought into the State 
 and left there by her mistress. In spite of this, Pro 
 fessor Stowe received word, after she had lived with 
 them some months, that the girl s master was in the city 
 looking for her, and that if she were not careful she 
 would be seized and conveyed back into slavery. Find 
 ing that this could be accomplished by boldness, per 
 jury, and the connivance of some unscrupulous justice, 
 Professor Stowe determined to remove the girl to some 
 place of security where she might remain until the 
 search for her should be given up. Accordingly he 
 and his brother-in-law, Henry Ward Beecher, both 
 armed, drove the fugitive, in a covered wagon, at night, 
 by unfrequented roads, twelve miles back into the coun 
 try, and left her in safety with the family of old John 
 Van Zandt, the fugitive s friend. 
 
 It is from this incident of real life and personal ex 
 perience that Mrs. Stowe conceived the thrilling episode 
 of the fugitives escape from Tom Loker and Marks in 
 &quot; Uncle Tom s Cabin.&quot; 
 
 An amusing and at the same time most interesting 
 account of her struggles to accomplish literary work 
 amid her distracting domestic duties at this time is 
 furnished by the letter of one of her intimate friends, 
 who writes : 
 
 &quot; It was my good fortune to number Mrs. Stowe 
 

<page 123>
94 EARLY MARRIED LIFE. 
 
 among my friends, and during a visit to her I had an 
 opportunity one day of witnessing the combined exer 
 cise of her literary and domestic genius in a style that 
 to me was quite amusing. 
 
 &quot; ( Come Harriet/ said I, as I found her tending one 
 baby and watching two others just able to walk, ( where 
 is that piece for the &quot; Souvenir &quot; which I promised the 
 editor I would get from you and send on next week ? 
 You have only this one day left to finish it, and have 
 it I must. 
 
 &quot; And how will you get it, friend of mine ? said 
 Harriet. You will at least have to wait till I get 
 house-cleaning over and baby s teeth through. 
 
 &quot; As to house-cleaning, you can defer it one day 
 longer; and as to baby s teeth, there is to be no end to 
 them, as I can see. No, no ; to-day that story must be 
 ended. There Frederick has been sitting by Ellen and 
 saying all those pretty things for more than a month 
 now, and she has been turning and blushing till I am 
 sure it is time to go to her relief. Oome, it would not 
 take you three hours at the rate you can write to finish 
 the courtship, marriage, catastrophe, eclaircissement, 
 and all ; and this three hours labor of your brains will 
 earn enough to pay for all the sewing your fingers 
 could do for a year to come. Two dollars a page, my 
 dear, and you can write a page in fifteen minutes ! 
 Come, then, my lady housekeeper, economy is a cardi 
 nal virtue ; consider the economy of the thing. 
 
 &quot; But, my dear, here is a baby in my arms and two 
 little pussies by my side, and there is a great baking 
 down in the kitchen, and there is a &quot; new girl &quot; for 
 &quot; help,&quot; besides preparations to be made for house-

 cleaning next week. It is really out of the question, 
 you see/ 
 
 &quot; I see no such thing. I do not know what genius 
 is given for, if it is not to help a woman out of a scrape. 
 Come, set your wits to work, let me have my way, and 
 you shall have all the work done and finish the story 
 too. 
 
 &quot; Well, but kitchen affairs ? 
 
 &quot; We can manage them too. You know you can 
 write anywhere and anyhow. Just take your seat at 
 the kitchen table with your writing weapons, and while 
 you superintend Mina fill up the odd snatches of time 
 with the labors of your pen. 
 
 &quot; I carried my point. In ten minutes she was seated ; 
 a table with flour, roUing-pin, ginger, and lard on one 
 side, a dresser with eggs, pork, and beans and various 
 cooking utensils on the other, near her an oven heat 
 ing, and beside her a dark-skinned nymph, waiting 
 orders. 
 
 &quot; ( Here, Harriet,* said I, you can write on this atlas 
 in your lap ; no matter how the writing looks, I will 
 copy it. 
 
 &quot; Well, well, said she, with a resigned sort of 
 amused look. Mina, you may do what I told you, 
 while I write a few minutes, till it is time to mould up 
 the bread. Where is the inkstand ? 
 
 &quot; Here it is, close by, on the top of the tea-kettle, 
 said I. 
 
 &quot; At this Mina giggled, and we both laughed to see 
 her merriment at our literary proceedings. 
 
 &quot; I began to overhaul the portfolio to find the right 
 sheet.

 &quot; Here it is/ said I. Here is Frederick sitting by 
 Ellen, glancing at her brilliant face, and saying some 
 thing about &quot; guardian angel/ and all that you re 
 member ? 
 
 &quot; Yes, yes/ said she, falling into a muse, as she at 
 tempted to recover the thread of her story. 
 
 &quot; Ma am, shall I put the pork on the top of the 
 beans ? asked Mina. 
 
 &quot; Come, come/ said Harriet, laughing. &amp;lt; You see 
 how it is. Mina is a new hand and cannot do anything 
 without me to direct her. We must give up the writ 
 ing for to-day. 
 
 &quot; ( No, no ; let us have another trial. You can dictate 
 as easily as you can write. Come, I can set the baby 
 in this clothes-basket and give him some mischief or 
 other to keep him quiet ; you shall dictate and I will 
 write. Now, this is the place where you left off : you 
 were describing the scene between Ellen and her lover ; 
 the last sentence was, &quot; Borne down by the tide of 
 agony, she leaned her head on her hands, the tears 
 streamed through her fingers, and her whole frame 
 shook with convulsive sobs.&quot; What shall I write 
 next ? 
 
 &quot; Mina, pour a little milk into this pearlash/ said 
 Harriet. 
 
 &quot; Come/ said I. &quot; The tears streamed through 
 her fingers and her whole frame shook with convulsive 
 sobs.&quot; What next? 
 
 &quot; Harriet paused and looked musingly out of the 
 window, as she turned her mind to her story. You 
 may write now/ said she, and she dictated as follows : 
 
 &quot; &quot; Her lover wept with her, nor dared he again to 
 

<page 126>
ROMANCE AND REALITY. 97 
 
 touch the point so sacredly guarded &quot; Mina, roll that 
 crust a little thinner. &quot; He spoke in soothing tones &quot; 
 Mina, poke the coals in the oven. 
 
 &quot; Here/ said I, let me direct Mina about these 
 matters, and write a while yourself. 
 
 66 Harriet took the pen and patiently set herself to 
 the work. For a while my culinary knowledge and 
 skill were proof to all Mina s investigating inquiries, 
 and they did not fail till I saw two pages completed. 
 
 &quot; You have done bravely/ said I, as I read over the 
 manuscript ; 6 now you must direct Mina a while. Mean 
 while dictate and I will write. 
 
 &quot; Never was there a more docile literary lady than 
 my friend. Without a word of objection she followed 
 my request. 
 
 &quot; I am ready to write/ said I. The last sentence 
 was : &quot; What is this life to one who has suffered as I 
 have ? &quot; What next ? 
 
 &quot; Shall I put in the brown or the white bread first ? 
 said Mina. 
 
 &quot; The brown first/ said Harriet. 
 
 &quot; &quot; What is this life to one who has suffered as I 
 have? &quot;said I. 
 
 &quot; Harriet brushed the flour off her apron and sat 
 down for a moment in a muse. Then she dictated as 
 follows : 
 
 &quot; &quot; Under the breaking of my heart I have borne 
 up. I have borne up under all that tries a woman, 
 but this thought, oh, Henry ! &quot; 
 
 &quot; Ma am, shall I put ginger into this pumpkin ? 
 queried Mina. 
 
 &quot; No, you may let that alone just now/ replied Har 
 riet. She then proceeded : 
 

<page 127>
98 EARLY MARRIED LIFE. 
 
 &quot; &quot; I know my duty to my children. I see the hour 
 must come. You must take them, Henry ; they are my 
 last earthly comfort.&quot; 
 
 &quot; Ma am, what shall I do with these egg-shells and 
 all this truck here ? interrupted Mina. 
 
 &quot; Put them in the pail by you, answered Harriet. 
 
 &quot; &quot; They are my last earthly comfort,&quot; said I. 
 &amp;lt; What next? 
 
 &quot; She continued to dictate, 
 
 &quot; * &quot; You must take them away. It may be per 
 haps it must be that I shall soon follow, but the 
 breaking heart of a wife still pleads, a little longer, a 
 little longer. &quot; 
 
 &quot; How much longer must the gingerbread stay in ? 
 inquired Mina. 
 
 &quot; Five minutes, said Harriet. 
 
 &quot; &quot; A little longer, a little longer,&quot; I repeated in 
 a dolorous tone, and we burst into a laugh. 
 
 &quot; Thus we went on, cooking, writing, nursing, and 
 laughing, till I finally accomplished my object. The 
 piece was finished, copied, and the next day sent to the 
 editor.&quot; \f 
 
 The widely scattered members of the Beecher family 
 had a fashion of communicating with each other by 
 means of circular letters. These, begun on great sheets 
 of paper, at either end of the line, were passed along 
 from one to another, each one adding his or her budget 
 of news to the general stock. When the filled sheet 
 reached the last person for whom it was intended, it was 
 finally remailed to its point of departure. Except in 
 the cases of Mrs. Stowe and Mrs. Perkins, the simple 
 address &quot; Rev. Mr. Beecher &quot; was sufficient to insure its 
 safe delivery in any town to which it was sent.

 One of these great, closely-written sheets, bearing in

 DEAR FRIENDS, I am going to Hartford myself, 
 and therefore shall not write, but hurry along the 
 preparations for my forward journey. Belle, father

 on you coming back. Good-by. 
 
 Affectionately to all, H. E. STOWE.

 ON January 7, 1839, Professor Stowe wrote to his 
 mother in Natick, Mass. : &quot; You left here, I believe, 
 in the right time, for as there has been no navigation 
 
 O O 
 
 on the Ohio River for a year, we are almost in a state 
 of famine as to many of the necessities of life. For 
 example, salt (coarse) has sold in Cincinnati this winter 
 for three dollars a bushel ; rice eighteen cents a pound ; 
 coffee fifty cents a pound ; white sugar the same ; brown 
 sugar twenty cents ; molasses a dollar a gallon ; potatoes 
 a dollar a bushel. We do without such things mostly ; 
 as there is yet plenty of bread and bacon (flour six and 
 seven dollars a barrel, and good pork from six to eight 
 cents a pound) we get along very comfortably. 
 
 &quot; Our new house is pretty much as it was, but they 
 say it will be finished in July. I expect to visit you 
 next summer, as I shall deliver the Phi Beta Kappa 
 oration at Dartmouth College ; but whether wife and 
 children come with me or not is not yet decided.&quot; 
 
 Mrs. Stowe came on to the East with her husband 
 

<page 130>
BIRTH OF A SON. 101 
 
 and children during the following summer, and before 
 her return made a trip through the White Mountains. 
 
 In May, 1840, her second son was born and named 
 Frederick William, after the sturdy Prussian king, for 
 whom her husband cherished an unbounded admiration. 
 
 Mrs. Stowe has said somewhere : &quot; So we go, dear 
 reader, so long as we have a body and a soul. For 
 worlds must mingle, the great and the little, the 
 solemn and the trivial, wreathing in and out like the 
 grotesque carvings on a gothic shrine ; only did we 
 know it rightly, nothing is trivial, since the human soul, 
 with its awful shadow, makes all things sacred.&quot; So 
 in writing a biography it is impossible for us to teU 
 what did and what did not powerfully influence the 
 character. It is safer simply to tell the unvarnished 
 truth. The lily builds up its texture of delicate beauty 
 from mould and decay. So how do we know from 
 what humble material a soul grows in strength and 
 beauty ! , 
 
 In December, 1840, writing to Miss May, Mrs. Stowe 
 says : 
 
 &quot; For a year I have held the pen only to write an 
 occasional business letter such as could not be neg- 
 
 o 
 
 lee ted. This was primarily owing to a severe neuralgic 
 complaint that settled in my eyes, and for two months 
 not only made it impossible for me to use them in writ 
 ing, but to fix them with attention on anything. I 
 could not even bear the least light of day in my room. 
 Then my dear little Frederick was born, and for two 
 months more I was confined to my bed. Besides all 
 this, we have had an unusual amount of sickness in our 
 family. . . . 
 

<page 131>
102 POVERTY AND SICKNESS. 
 
 &quot; For all that my history of the past year records so 
 many troubles, I cannot on the whole regard it as a 
 very troublous one. I have had so many counterbal 
 ancing mercies that I must regard myself as a person 
 greatly blessed. It is true that about six months out of 
 the twelve I have been laid up with sickness, but then 
 I have had every comfort and the kindest of nurses 
 in my faithful Anna. My children have thriven, and 
 on the whole ( come to more, as the Yankees say, than 
 the care of them. Thus you see my troubles have been 
 but enough to keep me from loving earth too well.&quot; 
 
 In the spring of 1842 Mrs. Stowe again visited 
 Hartford, taking her six-year-old daughter Hatty with 
 her. In writing from there to her husband she con 
 fides some of her literary plans and aspirations to him, 
 and he answers : 
 
 &quot; My dear, you must be a literary woman. It is so 
 written in the book of fate. Make all your calculations 
 accordingly. Get a good stock of health and brush up 
 your mind. Drop the E. out of your name. It only 
 incumbers it and interferes with the flow and euphony. 
 Write yourself fully and always Harriet Beecher Stowe, 
 which is a name euphonious, flowing, and full of mean 
 ing. Then my word for it, your husband will lift up 
 his head in the gate, and your children will rise up and 
 call you blessed. 
 
 &quot; Our humble dwelling has to-day received a distin 
 guished honor of which I must give you an account. 
 It was a visit from his excellency the Baron de Roenne, 
 ambassador of his majesty the King of Prussia to the 
 United States. He was pleased to assure me of the 
 great satisfaction my report on Prussian schools had 
 

<page 132>
LITERARY PROSPECTS. 103 
 
 afforded the king and members of his court, with much 
 more to the same effect. Of course having a real live 
 lord to exhibit, I was anxious for some one to exhibit 
 him to ; but neither Aunt Esther nor Anna dared ven 
 ture near the study, though they both contrived to get 
 a peep at his lordship from the little chamber window 
 as he was leaving. 
 
 &quot; And now, my dear wife, I want you to come home 
 as quick as you can. The fact is I cannot live without 
 you, and if we were not so prodigious poor I would 
 come for you at once. There is no woman like you 
 in this wide world. Who else has so much talent with 
 so little self-conceit ; so much reputation with so little 
 affectation ; so much literature with so little nonsense ; 
 so much enterprise with so little extravagance ; so much 
 tongue with so little scold ; so much sweetness with so 
 little softness ; so much of so many things and so little 
 of so many other things ? &quot; 
 
 In answer to this letter Mrs. Stowe writes from Hart 
 ford : 
 
 &quot; I have seen Johnson of the Evangelist. He is 
 very liberally disposed, and I may safely reckon on be 
 ing paid for all I do there. Who is that Hale, Jr., that 
 sent me the Boston Miscellany, and will he keep his 
 word with me ? His offers are very liberal, twenty 
 dollars for three pages, not very close print. Is he to 
 be depended on ? If so, it is the best offer I have re 
 ceived yet. I shall get something from the Harpers 
 some time this winter or spring. Robertson, the pub 
 lisher here, says the book ( The Mayflower ) will sell, 
 and though the terms they offer me are very low, that 
 I shall make something on it. For a second volume I 
 

<page 133>
104 POVERTY AND SICKNESS. 
 
 shall be able to make better terms. On the whole, my 
 dear, if I choose to be a literary lady, I have, I think, 
 as good a chance of making profit by it as any one I 
 know of. But with all this, I have my doubts whether 
 I shall be able to do so. 
 
 &quot; Our children are just coming to the age when 
 everything depends on my efforts. They are delicate 
 in health, and nervous and excitable, and need a moth 
 er s whole attention. Can I lawfully divide my atten 
 tion by literary efforts? 
 
 &quot; There is one thing I must suggest. If I am to 
 write, I must have a room to myself, which shall be my 
 room. I have in my own mind pitched on Mrs. Whip- 
 pie s room. I can put the stove in it. I have bought 
 a cheap carpet for it, and I have furniture enough at 
 home to furnish it comfortably, and I only beg in addi 
 tion that you will let me change the glass door from 
 the nursery into that room and keep my plants there, 
 and then I shall be quite happy. 
 
 &quot; All last winter I felt the need of some place where 
 I could go and be quiet and satisfied. I could not 
 there, for there was all the setting of tables, and clear 
 ing up of tables, and dressing and washing of children, 
 and everything else going on, and the constant falling 
 of soot and coal dust on everything in the room was a 
 constant annoyance to me, and I never felt comfortable 
 there though I tried hard. Then if I came into the 
 parlor where you were I felt as if I were interrupting 
 you, and you know you sometimes thought so too. 
 
 &quot; Now this winter let the cooking-stove be put into 
 that room, and let the pipe run up through the floor 
 into the room above. We can eat by our cooking-stove, 
 

<page 134>
THE SOUVENIR. 105 
 
 and the children can be washed and dressed and keep 
 their playthings in the room above, and play there when 
 we don t want them below. You can study by the par 
 lor fire, and I and my plants, etc., will take the other 
 room. I shall keep my work and all my things there 
 and feel settled and quiet. I intend to have a regular 
 part of each day devoted to the children, and then I 
 shall take them in there.&quot; 
 
 In his reply to this letter Professor Stowe says : 
 
 &quot; The little magazine ( The Souvenir ) goes ahead 
 finely. Fisher sent down to Fulton the other day and 
 got sixty subscribers. He will make the June number 
 as handsome as possible, as a specimen number for the 
 students, several of whom will take agencies for it dur 
 ing the coming vacation. You have it in your power 
 by means of this little magazine to form the mind of 
 the West for the coming generation. It is just as I 
 told you in my last letter. God has written it in his 
 book that you must be a literary woman, and who are 
 we that we should contend against God ? You must 
 therefore make all your calculations to spend the rest 
 of your life with your pen. 
 
 &quot; If you only could come home to-day how happy 
 should I be. I am daily finding out more and more 
 (what I knew very well before) that you are the most 
 intelligent and agreeable woman in the whole circle of 
 my acquaintance.&quot; 
 
 That Professor Stowe s devoted admiration for his 
 wife was reciprocated, and that a most perfect sympathy 
 of feeling existed between the husband and wife, is 
 shown by a line in one of Mrs. Stowe s letters from 
 Hartford in which she says : &quot; I was telling Belle yes- 
 

<page 135>
106 POVERTY AND SICKNESS. 
 
 terday that I did not know till I came away how much 
 I was dependent upon you for information. There are 
 a thousand favorite subjects on which I could talk with 
 you better than with any one else. If you were not 
 already my dearly loved husband I should certainly fall 
 in love with you.&quot; 
 
 In this same letter she writes of herself : 
 
 &quot; One thing more in regard to myself. The absence 
 and wandering of mind and forgetfulness that so often 
 vexes you is a physical infirmity with me. It is the 
 failing of a mind not calculated to endure a great pres 
 sure of care, and so much do I feel the pressure I am 
 under, so much is my mind often darkened and troubled 
 by care, that life seriously considered holds out few 
 allurements, only my children. 
 
 &quot; In returning to my family, from whom I have been 
 so long separated, I am impressed with a new and 
 solemn feeling of responsibility. It appears to me that 
 I am not probably destined for long life ; at all events, 
 the feeling is strongly impressed upon my mind that a 
 work is put into my hands which I must be earnest to 
 finish shortly. It is nothing great or brilliant in the 
 world s eye ; it lies in one small family circle, of which 
 I am called to be the central point.&quot; 
 
 On her way home from this Eastern visit Mrs. Stowe 
 traveled for the first time by rail, and of this novel 
 experience she writes to Miss Georgiana May : 
 
 BATAVIA, August 29, 1842. 
 
 Here I am at Brother William s, and our passage 
 along this railroad reminds me of the verse of the 
 psalm : 
 
 &quot; Tho lions roar and tempests blow, 
 And rocks and dangers fill the way.&quot; 
 

<page 136>
RAILROAD JOURNEY. 107 
 
 Such confusion of tongues, such shouting and swear 
 ing, such want of all sort of system and decency in ar 
 rangements, I never desire to see again. I was literally 
 almost trodden down and torn to pieces in the Rochester 
 depot when I went to help my poor, near-sighted spouse 
 in sorting out the baggage. You see there was an ac 
 cident which happened to the cars leaving Rochester 
 that morning, which kept us two hours and a half at 
 the passing place this side of Auburn, waiting for them 
 to come up and go by us. The consequence was that 
 we got into this Rochester depot aforesaid after dark, 
 and the steamboat, the canal-boat, and the Western 
 train of cars had all been kept waiting three hours be 
 yond their usual time, and they all broke loose upon us 
 the moment we put our heads out of the cars, and such 
 a jerking, and elbowing, and scuffling, and swearing, 
 and protesting, and scolding you never heard, while the 
 great locomotive sailed up and down in the midst there 
 of, spitting fire and smoke like some great fiend mon 
 ster diverting himself with our commotions. I do think 
 these steam concerns border a little too much on the 
 supernatural to be agreeable, especially when you are 
 shut up in a great dark depot after sundown. 
 
 Well, after all, we had to ride till twelve o clock at 
 night to get to Batavia, and I ve been sick abed, so to 
 speak, ever since. 
 
 The winter of 1842 was one of peculiar trial to the 
 family at Walnut Hills ; as Mrs. Stowe writes, &quot; It was 
 a season of sickness and gloom.&quot; Typhoid fever raged 
 among the students of the seminary, and the house of 
 the president was converted into a hospital, while the 
 

<page 137>
108 POVERTY AND SICKNESS. 
 
 members of his family were obliged to devote them 
 selves to nursing the sick and dying. 
 
 July 6, 1843, a few weeks before the birth of her 
 third daughter, Georgiana May, a most terrible and 
 overwhelming sorrow came on Mrs. Stowe, in common 
 with all the family, in the sudden death of her brother, 
 the Rev. George Beecher. 
 
 He was a young man of unusual talent and ability, 
 and much loved by his church and congregation. The 
 circumstances of his death are related in a letter written 
 by Mrs. Stowe, and are as follows : &quot; Noticing the birds 
 destroying his fruit and injuring his plants, he went for 
 a double-barreled gun, which he scarcely ever had used, 
 out of regard to the timidity and anxiety of his wife in 
 reference to it. Shortly after he left the house, one of 
 the elders of his church in passing saw him discharge 
 one barrel at the birds. Soon after he heard the fatal 
 report and saw the smoke, but the trees shut out the 
 rest from sight. ... In about half an hour after, the 
 family assembled at breakfast, and the servant was sent 
 out to call him. ... In a few minutes she returned, 
 exclaiming, Oh, Mr. Beecher is dead ! Mr. Beecher is 
 dead ! ... In a short time a visitor in the family, 
 assisted by a passing laborer, raised him up and bore 
 him to the house. His face was pale and but slightly 
 marred, his eyes were closed, and over his countenance 
 rested the sweet expression of peaceful slumber. . . . 
 Then followed the hurried preparations for the funeral 
 .and journey, until three o clock, when, all arrange 
 ments being made, he was borne from his newly finished 
 house, through his blooming garden, to the new church, 
 planned and just completed under his directing eye. 
 

<page 138>
DEATH OF REV. GEORGE BEECHER. 109 
 
 . . . The sermon and the prayers were finished, the 
 choir he himself had trained sung their parting hymn, 
 and at about five the funeral train started for a journey 
 of over seventy miles. That night will stand alone in 
 the memories of those who witnessed its scenes ! 
 
 &quot; At ten in the evening heavy clouds gathered low 
 ering behind, and finally rose so as nearly to cover the 
 hemisphere, sending forth mutterings of thunder and 
 constant flashes of lightning. 
 
 &quot; The excessive heat of the weather, the darkness of 
 the night, the solitary road, the flaring of the lamps 
 and lanterns, the flashes of the lightning, the roll of 
 approaching thunder, the fear of being overtaken in an 
 unfrequented place and the lights extinguished by the 
 rain, the sad events of the day, the cries of the infant 
 boy sick with the heat and bewailing the father who 
 ever before had soothed his griefs, all combined to 
 awaken the deepest emotions of the sorrowful, the aw 
 ful, and the sublime. . . . 
 
 &quot; And so it is at last ; there must come a time when 
 all that the most heart-broken, idolizing love can give 
 us is a coffin and a grave ! All that could be done for 
 our brother, with all his means and all the affection of 
 his people and friends, was just this, no more ! After 
 all, the deepest and most powerful argument for the 
 religion of Christ is its power in times like this. Take 
 from us Christ and what He taught, and what have we 
 here? What confusion, what agony, what dismay, 
 what wreck and waste ! But give Him to us, even the 
 most stricken heart can rise under the blow ; yea, even 
 triumph ! 
 
 &quot; * Thy brother shall rise again, said Jesus ; and to 
 

<page 139>
110 POVERTY AND SICKNESS. 
 
 us who weep He speaks : Rejoice, inasmuch as ye are 
 made partakers of Christ s sufferings, that when his 
 glory shall be revealed, ye also may be glad with ex 
 ceeding joy ! 
 
 The advent of Mrs. Stowe s third daughter was 
 followed by a protracted illness and a struggle with 
 great poverty, of which Mrs. Stowe writes in October, 
 1843 : 
 
 &quot; Our straits for money this year are unparalleled 
 even in our annals. Even our bright and cheery neigh 
 bor Allen begins to look blue, and says $600 is the 
 very most we can hope to collect of our salary, once 
 $1,200. We have a flock of entirely destitute young 
 men in the seminary, as poor in money as they are rich 
 in mental and spiritual resources. They promise to be 
 as fine a band as those we have just sent off. We have 
 two from Iowa and Wisconsin who were actually crowded 
 from secular pursuits into the ministry by the wants of 
 the people about them. Revivals began, and the people 
 came to them saying, We have no minister, and you 
 must preach to us, for you know more than we do. 
 
 In the spring of 1844 Professor Stowe visited the 
 East to arouse an interest in the struggling seminary 
 and raise funds for its maintenance. While he was 
 there he received the foUowing letter from Mrs. 
 Stowe : 
 
 &quot; I am already half sick with confinement to the 
 house and overwork. If I should sew every day for a 
 month to come I should not be able to accomplish a 
 half of what is to be done, and should be only more 
 unfit for my other duties.&quot; 
 
 This struggle against ill-health and poverty was con- 
 

<page 140>
DISC OUR A GEHENTS. Ill 
 
 tinued through that year and well into the next, when, 
 during her husband s absence to attend a ministerial 
 convention at Detroit, Mrs. Stowe writes to him : 
 
 June 16, 1845. 
 
 MY DEAR HUSBAND, It is a dark, sloppy, rainy, 
 muddy, disagreeable day, and I have been working hard 
 (for me) all day in the kitchen, washing dishes, looking, 
 into closets, and seeing a great deal of that dark side 
 of domestic life which a housekeeper may who will 
 investigate too curiously into minutia3 in warm, damp 
 weather, especially after a girl who keeps all clean on 
 the outside of cup and platter, and is very apt to make 
 good the rest of the text in the inside of things. 
 
 I am sick of the smell of sour milk, and sour meat, 
 and sour everything, and then the clothes will not dry, 
 and no wet thing does, and everything smells mouldy ; 
 and altogether I feel as if I never w r anted to eat again. 
 
 Your letter, which was neither sour nor mouldy, 
 formed a very agreeable contrast to all these things ; 
 the more so for being unexpected. I am much obliged 
 to you for it. As to my health, it gives me very little 
 solicitude, although I am bad enough and daily grow 
 ing worse. I feel no life, no energy, no appetite, or 
 rather a growing distaste for food ; in fact, I am be 
 coming quite ethereal. Upon reflection I perceive that 
 it pleases my Father to keep me in the fire, for my whole 
 situation is excessively harassing and painful. I suffer 
 with sensible distress in the brain, as I have done more 
 or less since my sickness last winter, a distress which 
 some days takes from me all power of planning or exe 
 cuting anything ; and you know that, except this poor

 head, my unfortunate household has no mainspring, for 
 nobody feels any kind of responsibility to do a thing 
 in time, place, or manner, except as I oversee it. 
 
 Georgiana is so excessively weak, nervous, cross, and 
 fretful, night and day, that she takes all Anna s strength 
 and time with her ; and then the children are, like other 
 little sons and daughters of Adam, full of all kinds of 
 absurdity and folly. 
 
 When the brain gives out, as mine often does, and 
 one cannot think or remember anything, then what is 
 to be done ? All common fatigue, sickness, and ex 
 haustion is nothing to this distress. Yet do I rejoice 
 in my God and know in whom I believe, and only pray 
 that the fire may consume the dross ; as to the gold, 
 that is imperishable. No real evil can happen to me, 
 so I fear nothing for the future, and only suffer in the 
 present tense. 
 
 God, the mighty God, is mine, of that I am sure, and 
 I know He knows that though flesh and heart fail, I am 
 all the while desiring and trying for his will alone. As 
 to a journey, I need not ask a physician to see that it 
 is needful to me as far as health is concerned, that is to 
 say, all human appearances are that way, but I feel no 
 particular choice about it. If God wills I go. He can 
 easily find means. Money, I suppose, is as plenty with 
 Kim now as it always has been, and if He sees it is 
 really best He will doubtless help me.y 
 
 That the necessary funds were provided is evident 
 from the fact that the journey was undertaken and the 
 invalid spent the summer of 1845 in Hartford, in Na- 
 tick, and in Boston. She was not, however, perma-

 nently benefited by the change, and in the following 
 spring it was deemed necessary to take more rad 
 ical measures to arrest the progress of her increasing 
 debility. After many consultations and much corre 
 spondence it was finally decided that she should go 
 to Dr. Wesselhoeft s watercure establishment at Brat- 
 tleboro , Vt. 
 
 At this time, under date of March, 1846, she writes : 
 
 &quot; For all I have had trouble I can think of nothing 
 but the greatness and richness of God s mercy to me 
 in giving me such friends, and in always caring for us 
 in every strait. There has been no day this winter 
 when I have not had abundant reason to see this. 
 Some friend has always stepped in to cheer and help, 
 so that I have wanted for nothing. My husband has 
 developed wonderfully as house-father and nurse. You 
 would laugh to see him in his spectacles gravely march 
 ing the little troop in their nightgowns up to bed, tag 
 ging after them, as he says, like an old hen after a flock 
 of ducks. The money for my journey has been sent 
 in from an unknown hand in a wonderful manner. All 
 this shows the care of our Father, and encourages me to 
 rejoice and to hope in Him.&quot; 
 
 A few days after her departure Professor Stowe wrote 
 to his wife : 
 
 &quot; I was greatly comforted by your brief letter from 
 Pittsburgh. When I returned from the steamer the 
 morning you left I found in the post-office a letter from 
 Mrs. G. W. Bull of New York, inclosing $50 on ac 
 count of the sickness in my family. There was another 
 inclosing $50 more from a Mrs. Devereaux of Raleigh, 
 N. C., besides some smaller sums from others. My heart 
 

<page 143>

 went out to God in aspiration and gratitude. None of 
 the donors, so far as I know, have I ever seen or heard 
 of before. 
 
 &quot; Henry and I have been living in a Robinson Cru 
 soe and man Friday sort of style, greatly to our satis 
 faction, ever since you went away.&quot; 
 
 Mrs. Stowe was accompanied to Brattleboro by her 
 sisters, Catherine and Mary, who were also suffering 
 from troubles that they felt might be relieved by hydro 
 pathic treatment. 
 
 From May, 1846, until March, 1847, she remained 
 at Brattleboro without seeing her husband or children. 
 During these weary months her happiest days were 
 those upon which she received letters from home. 
 
 The following extracts, taken from letters written by 
 her during this period, are of value, as revealing what 
 it is possible to know of her habits of thought and 
 mode of life at this time. 
 
 BRATTLEBORO , September, 1846. 
 
 MY DEAR HUSBAND, I have been thinking of all 
 your trials, and I really pity you in having such a wife. 
 I feel as if I had been only a hindrance to you instead 
 of a help, and most earnestly and daily do I pray to 
 God to restore my health that I may do something for 
 you and my family. I think if I were only at home I 
 could at least sweep and dust, and wash potatoes, and 
 cook a little, and talk some to my children, and should 
 be doing something for my family. But the hope of 
 getting better buoys me up. I go through these tedi 
 ous and wearisome baths and bear that terrible douche 
 thinking of my children. They never will know how 
 I love them. 
 

<page 144>
GOSPEL OF HEALTH. 115 
 
 There is great truth and good sense in your analysis 
 of the cause of our past failures. We have now come 
 to a sort of crisis. If you and I do as we should for 
 five years to come the character of our three oldest 
 children will be established. This is why I am willing 
 to spend so much time and make such efforts to have 
 health. Oh, that God would give me these five years 
 in full possession of mind and body, that I may train 
 my children as they should be trained. I am fully 
 aware of the importance of system and order in a fam 
 ily. I know that nothing can be done without it ; it 
 is the keystone, the sine qua non, and in regard to my 
 children I place it next to piety. At the same time it 
 is true that both Anna l and I labor under serious natu 
 ral disadvantages on this subject. It is not all that is 
 necessary to feel the importance of order and system, 
 but it requires a particular kind of talent to carry it 
 through a family. Very much the same kind of talent, 
 as Uncle Samuel said, which is necessary to make a 
 good prime minister. . . . 
 
 I think you might make an excellent sermon to Chris 
 tians on the care of health, in consideration of the va 
 rious infirmities and impediments to the developing the 
 results of religion, that result from bodily ill health, and 
 I wish you would make one that your own mind may 
 be more vividly impressed with it. The world is too 
 much in a hurry. Ministers think there is no way to 
 serve Christ but to overdraw on their physical capital 
 for four or five years for Christ and then have nothing 
 to give, but become a mere burden on his hands for the 
 next five. . . .

 November 18. &quot; The daily course I go through pre 
 supposes a degree of vigor beyond anything I ever had 
 before. For this week, I have gone before breakfast 
 to the wave-bath and let all the waves and billows roll 
 over me till every limb ached with cold and my hands 
 would scarcely have feeling enough to dress me. After 
 that I have walked till I was warm, and come home to 
 breakfast with such an appetite ! Brown bread and 
 milk are luxuries indeed, and the only fear is that I 
 may eat too much. At eleven comes my douche, to 
 which I have walked in a driving rain for the last two 
 days, and after it walked in the rain again till I was 
 warm. (The umbrella you gave me at Natick answers 
 finely, as well as if it were a silk one.) After dinner I 
 roll ninepins or walk till four, then sitz-bath, and another 
 walk till six. 
 
 &quot; I am anxious for your health ; do be persuaded to 
 try a long walk before breakfast. You don t know how 
 much good it will do you. Don t sit in your hot study 
 without any ventilation, a stove burning up all the 
 vitality of the air and weakening your nerves, and 
 above all, do amuse yourself. Go to Dr. Mussey s and 
 spend an evening, and to father s and Professor Allen s. 
 When you feel worried go off somewhere and forget 
 and throw it off. I should really rejoice to hear that 
 you and father and mother, with Professor and Mrs. 
 AUen, Mrs. K., and a few others of the same calibre 
 would agree to meet together for dancing cotillons. It 
 would do you all good, and if you took Mr. K. s wife 
 and poor Miss Much- Afraid, her daughter, into the alli 
 ance it would do them good. Bless me ! what a pro 
 fane set everybody would think you were, and yet you

 are the people of all the world most solemnly in need 
 of it. I wish you could be with me in Brattleboro and 
 coast down hill on a sled, go sliding and snowballing 
 by moonlight ! I would snowball every bit of the 
 hypo out of you ! Now, my dear, if you are going to 
 get sick, I am going to come home. There is no use 
 in my trying to get well if you, in the mean time, are 
 going to run yourself down.&quot; 
 
 January, 1847. 
 
 MY DEAR SOUL, I received your most melancholy 
 effusion, and I am sorry to find it s just so. I entirely 
 agree and sympathize. Why did n t you engage the 
 two tombstones one for you and one for me ? 
 
 I shall have to copy for your edification a &quot; poem on 
 tombstones &quot; which Kate put at Christmas into the

 stocking of one of our most hypochondriac gentlemen, 
 who had pished and pshawed at his wife and us for try 
 ing to get up a little fun. This poem was fronted with 
 the above vignette and embellished with sundry similar 
 ones, and tied with a long black ribbon. There were

 only two cantos in very concise style, so I shall send 
 you them entire. 
 
 CANTO I. 
 
 In the kingdom of Mortin 
 I had the good fortin 
 To find these verses 
 On tombs and on hearses, 
 Which I, being jinglish 
 Have done into English. 
 
 CANTO II. 
 
 The man what s so colickish 
 
 When his friends are all frolickish 
 
 As to turn up his noses 
 
 And turn on his toses 
 
 Shall have only verses 
 
 On tombstones and hearses. 
 
 But, seriously, my dear husband, you must try and 
 be patient, for this cannot last forever. Be patient and 
 bear it like the toothache, or a driving rain, or anything 
 else that you cannot escape. To see things as through 
 a glass darkly is your infirmity, you know ; but the 
 Lord will yet deliver you from this trial. I know how 
 cto pity you, for the last three weeks I have suffered 
 from an overwhelming mental depression, a perfect 
 heartsickness. All I wanted was to get home and die. 
 Die I was very sure I should at any rate, but I suppose 
 I was never less prepared to do so. 
 
 The long exile was ended in the spring of 1847, and 
 in May Mrs. Stowe returned to her Cincinnati home, 
 where she was welcomed with sincere demonstrations of 
 joy by her husband and children. 
 
 Her sixth child, Samuel Charles, was born in Janu 
 ary of 1848, and about this time her husband s health 
 became so seriously impaired that it was thought desir- 
 

<page 148>

 able for him in turn to spend a season at the Brattle- 
 boro water-cure. He went in June, 1848, and was 
 compelled by the very precarious state of his health to 
 remain until September, 1849. During this period of 
 more than a year Mrs. Stowe remained in Cincinnati 
 caring for her six children, eking out her slender in 
 come by taking boarders and writing when she found 
 time, confronting a terrible epidemic of cholera that 
 carried off one of her little flock, and in every way 
 showing herself to be a brave woman, possessed of a 
 spirit that could rise superior to all adversity. Con 
 cerning this time she writes in January, 1849, to her 
 dearest friend : 
 
 MY BELOVED GEORGYj For six months after my 
 return from Brattleboro my eyes were so affected that 
 I wrote scarce any, and my health was in so strange a 
 state that I felt no disposition to write. After the 
 birth of little Charley my health improved, but my hus 
 band was sick and I have been so loaded and burdened 
 with cares as to drain me dry of all capacity of thought, 
 feeling, memory, or emotion. 
 
 &quot; Well, Georgy, I am thirty-seven years old ! I am 
 glad of it. I like to grow old and have six children 
 and cares endless. I wish you could see me with my 
 flock all around me. They sum up my cares, and 
 were they gone I should ask myself, What now re 
 mains to be done? They are my work, over which I/ 
 fear and tremble. 
 
 In the early summer of 1849 cholera broke out in 
 Cincinnati, and soon became epidemic. Professor

120 POVERTY AND SICKNESS. 
 
 Stowe, absent in Brattleboro , and filled with anxiety 
 for the safety of his family, was most anxious, in spite 
 of his feeble health, to return and share the danger 
 with them, but this his wife would not consent to, as 
 is shown by her letters to him, written at this time. 
 In one of them, dated June 29, 1849, she says : 
 
 MY DEAR HUSBAND, This week has been unus 
 ually fatal. The disease in the city has been malig 
 nant and virulent. Hearse drivers have scarce been 
 allowed to unharness their horses, while furniture carts 
 and common vehicles are often employed for the re 
 moval of the dead. The sable trains which pass our 
 windows, the frequent indications of crowding haste, 
 and the absence of reverent decency have, in many 
 cases, been most painful. Of course all these things, 
 whether we will or no, bring very doleful images to the 
 mind. 
 
 On Tuesday one hundred and sixteen deaths from 
 cholera were reported, and that night the air was of 
 that peculiarly oppressive, deathly kind that seems to 
 lie like lead on the brain and soul. 
 
 As regards your coming home, I am decidedly op 
 posed to it. First, because the chance of your being 
 taken ill is just as great as the chance of your being 
 able to render us any help. To exchange the salu 
 brious air of Brattleboro for the pestilent atmosphere 
 of this place with your system rendered sensitive by 
 water-cure treatment would be extremely dangerous. 
 It is a source of constant gratitude to me that neither 
 you nor father are exposed to the dangers here. 
 
 Second, none of us are sick, and it is very uncertain 
 whether we shall be. 
 

<page 150>
THE CHOLERA EPIDEMIC. 121 
 
 Third, if we were sick there are so many of us that 
 it is not at all likely we shall all be taken at once. 
 
 July 1. Yesterday Mr. Stagg went to the city and 
 found all gloomy and discouraged, while a universal 
 panic seemed to be drawing nearer than ever before. 
 Large piles of coal were burning on the cross walks 
 and in the public squares, while those who had talked 
 confidently of the cholera being confined to the lower 
 classes and those who were imprudent began to feel as 
 did the magicians of old, &quot; This is the finger of God.&quot; 
 
 Yesterday, upon the recommendation of all the cler 
 gymen of the city, the mayor issued a proclamation for 
 a day of general fasting, humiliation, and prayer, to be 
 observed on Tuesday next. 
 
 July 3. We are all in good health and try to main 
 tain a calm and cheerful frame of mind. The doctors 
 are nearly used up. Dr. Bowen and Dr. Peck are sick 
 in bed. Dr. Potter and Dr. Pulte ought, I suppose, to 
 be there also. The younger physicians have no rest 
 night or day. Mr. Fisher is laid up from his incessant 
 visitations with the sick and dying. Our own Dr. 
 Brown is likewise prostrated, but we are all resolute to 
 stand by each other, and there are so many of us that 
 it is not likely we can all be taken sick together. 
 
 July 4. All well. The meeting yesterday was very 
 solemn and interesting. There is more or less sickness 
 about us, but no very dangerous cases. One hundred 
 and twenty burials from cholera alone yesterday, yet 
 to-day we see parties bent on pleasure or senseless ca 
 rousing, while to-morrow and next day will witness a 
 fresh harvest of death from them. How we can become 
 accustomed to anything ! Awhile ago ten a day dying 
 

<page 151>
122 POVERTY AND SICKNESS. 
 
 of cholera struck terror to all hearts ; but now the tide 
 has surged up gradually until the deaths average over 
 a hundred daily, and everybody is getting accustomed 
 to it. Gentlemen make themselves agreeable to ladies 
 by reciting the number of deaths in this house or that. 
 This together with talk of funerals, cholera medicines, 
 cholera dietetics, and chloride of lime form the ordinary 
 staple of conversation. Serious persons of course throw 
 in moral reflections to their taste. 
 
 July 10. Yesterday little Charley was taken ill, 
 not seriously, and at any other season I should not be 
 alarmed. Now, however, a slight illness seems like a 
 death sentence, and I will not dissemble that I feel 
 from the outset very little hope. I still think it best 
 that you should not return. By so doing you might 
 lose all you have gained. You might expose yourself 
 to a fatal incursion of disease. It is decidedly not 
 your duty to do so. 
 
 July 12. Yesterday I carried Charley to Dr. Pulte, 
 who spoke in such a manner as discouraged and fright 
 ened me. He mentioned dropsy on the brain as a pos 
 sible result. I came home with a heavy heart, sorrow 
 ing, desolate, and wishing my husband and father were 
 here. 
 
 About one o clock this morning Miss Stewart sud 
 denly opened my door crying, &quot; Mrs. Stowe, Henry is 
 vomiting.&quot; I was on my feet in an instant, and lifted 
 up my heart for help. He was, however, in a few min 
 utes relieved. Then I turned my attention to Charley, 
 who was also suffering, put him into a wet sheet, and 
 kept him there until he was in a profuse perspiration. 
 He is evidently getting better, and is auspiciously cross. 
 

<page 152>
THE CHOLERA EPIDEMIC. 123 
 
 Never was crossness in a baby more admired Anna 
 and I have said to each other exultingly a score of 
 times, &quot; How cross the little fellow is ! How he does 
 scold ! &quot; 
 
 July 15. Since I last wrote our house has been a 
 perfect hospital. Charley apparently recovering, but 
 still weak and feeble, unable to walk or play, and so 
 miserably fretful and unhappy. Sunday Anna and I 
 were fairly stricken down, as many others are, with no 
 particular illness, but with such miserable prostration. 
 I lay on the bed all day reading my hymn-book and 
 thinking over passages of Scripture. 
 
 July 17. To-day we have been attending poor old 
 Aunt Frankie s 1 funeral. She died yesterday morning, 
 taken sick the day before while washing. Good, hon 
 est, trustful old soul ! She was truly one who hun 
 gered and thirsted for righteousness. 
 
 Yesterday morning our poor little dog, Daisy, who 
 had been ailing the day before, was suddenly seize :1 
 with frightful spasms and died in half an hour. Poor 
 little affectionate thing ! If I were half as good for my 
 nature as she for hers I should be much better than I 
 am. While we were all mourning over her the news 
 came that Aunt Frankie was breathing her last. Hatty, 
 Eliza, Anna, and I made her shroud yesterday, and 
 this morning I made her cap. We have just come 
 from her grave. 
 
 July 23. At last, my dear, the hand of the Lord 
 hath touched us. We have been watching all day by 
 the dying bed of little Charley, who is gradually sink 
 ing. After a partial recovery from the attack I de-

 scribed in my last letter he continued for some days 
 very feeble, but still we hoped for recovery. About 
 four days ago he was taken with decided cholera, and 
 now there is no hope of his surviving this night. 
 
 Every kindness is shown us by the neighbors. Do 
 not return. All will be over before you could possi 
 bly get here, and the epidemic is now said by the phy 
 sicians to prove fatal to every new case. Bear up. 
 Let us not faint when we are rebuked of Him. I dare 
 not trust myself to say more but shall write again soon. 
 
 July 26. 
 
 MY DEAR HUSBAND, At last it is over and our 
 dear little one is gone from us. He is now among 
 the blessed. My Charley my beautiful, loving, glad 
 some baby, so loving, so sweet, so full of life and hope 
 and strength now lies shrouded, pale and cold, in the 
 room below. Never was he anything to me but a com 
 fort. He has been my pride and joy. Many a heart 
 ache has he cured for me. Many an anxious night 
 have I held him to my bosom and felt the sorrow and 
 loneliness pass out of me with the touch of his little 
 warm hands. Yet I have just seen him in his death 
 agony, looked on his imploring face when I could not 
 help nor soothe nor do one thing, not one, to mitigate 
 his cruel suffering, do nothing but pray in my anguish 
 that he might die soon. I write as though there were 
 no sorrow like my sorrow, yet there has been in this 
 city, as in the land of Egypt, scarce a house without its 
 dead. This heart-break, this anguish, has been every 
 where, and when it will end God alone knows. 
 

<page 154>
THE COLLINS PROFESSORSHIP. 125 
 
 With this severest blow of all, the long years of 
 trial and suffering in the West practically end ; for in 
 September, 1849, Professor Stowe returned from Brat- 
 tleboro , and at the same time received a call to the 
 Collins Professorship at Bowdoin College, in Bruns 
 wick, Maine, that he decided to accept.

 FOR THE &quot;NATIONAL ERA.&quot; LETTER TO FREDERICK DOUGLASS. 
 &quot;UNCLE TOM S CABIN&quot; A WORK OF RELIGIOUS EMOTION. 
 
 EARLY in the winter of 1849 Mrs. Stowe wrote in 
 a private journal in which she recorded thought and 
 feeling concerning religious themes : &quot; It has been said 
 that it takes a man to write the life of a man ; that is, 
 there must be similarity of mind in the person who 
 undertakes to present the character of another. This 
 is true, also, of reading and understanding biography. 
 A statesman and general would read the life of Napo 
 leon with the spirit and the understanding, while the 
 commonplace man plods through it as a task. The 
 difference is that the one, being of like mind and spirit 
 with the subject of the biography, is able to sympathize 
 with him in all his thoughts and experiences, and the 
 other is not. The life of Henry Martyn would be 
 tedious and unintelligible to a mind like that of a 
 Richelieu or a Mazarin. They never experienced or 
 

<page 156>
SYMPATHY IN READING BIOGRAPHY. 127 
 
 saw or heard anything like it, and would be quite at a 
 loss where to place such a man in their mental cate 
 gories. It is not strange, therefore, that of all biog 
 raphy in the world that of Jesus Christ should be least 
 understood. It is an exception to all the world has 
 ever seen. The world knew Him not. There is, to 
 be sure, a simple grandeur about the life of Jesus which 
 awes almost every mind. The most hardened scoffer, 
 after he has jested and jeered at everything in the 
 temple of Christianity, stands for a moment uncovered 
 and breathless when he comes to the object of its adora 
 tion and feels how awful goodness is, and Virtue in her 
 shape how lovely. Yet, after all, the character of the 
 Christ has been looked at and not sympathized with. 
 Men have turned aside to see this great sight. Chris 
 tians have fallen in adoration, but very few have tried 
 to enter into his sympathies and to feel as He felt.&quot; 
 
 How little she dreamed that these words were to be 
 come profoundly appropriate as a description of her 
 own life in its relation to mankind ! How little the 
 countless thousands who read, have read, and will read, 
 &quot; Uncle Tom s Cabin &quot; enter into or sympathize with 
 the feelings out of which it was written ! A delicate, 
 sensitive woman struggling with poverty, with weary 
 step and aching head attending to the innumerable 
 demands of a large family of growing children ; a de 
 voted Christian seeking with strong crying and tears a 
 kingdom not of this world, is this the popular con 
 ception of the author of &quot; Uncle Tom s Cabin &quot; ? 
 Nevertheless it is the reality. When, amid the burn 
 ing ruins of a besieged city, a mother s voice is heard 
 uttering a cry of anguish over a child killed in her 
 

<page 157>
128 REMOVAL TO BRUNSWICK. 
 
 arms by a bursting shell, the attention is arrested, the 
 heart is touched. So &quot; Uncle Tom s Cabin &quot; was a cry 
 of anguish from a mother s heart, and uttered in sad 
 sincerity. It was the bursting forth of deep feeling, 
 with all the intense anguish of wounded love. It will 
 be the purpose of this chapter to show this, and to 
 cause to pass before the reader s mind the time, the 
 household, and the heart from which this cry was 
 heard. 
 
 After struggling for seventeen years with ill health 
 and every possible vexation and hindrance in his work, 
 Professor Stowe became convinced that it was his duty 
 to himself and his family to seek some other field of 
 labor. 
 
 February 6, 1850, he writes to his mother, in Na- 
 tick, Mass. : &quot; My health has not been good this win 
 ter, and I do not suppose that I should live long were 
 I to stay here. I have done a great deal of hard work 
 here, and. practiced no little self-denial. I have seen 
 the seminary carried through a most vexatious series of 
 lawsuits, ecclesiastical and civil, and raised from the 
 depths of poverty to comparative affluence, and I feel 
 at liberty now to leave. During the three months of 
 June, July, and August last, more than nine thousand 
 persons died of cholera within three miles of my house, 
 and this winter, in the same territory, there have been 
 more than ten thousand cases of small-pox, many of 
 them of the very worst kind. Several have died on the 
 hill, and the Jesuits college near us has been quite 
 broken up by it. There have been, however, no cases 
 in our families or in the seminary. 
 
 &quot; I have received many letters from friends in the 
 

<page 158>
REASONS FOR LEAVING THE WEST. 129 
 
 East expressing great gratification at the offer from 
 Bowdoin College, and the hope that I would accept 
 it. I am quite inclined to do so, but the matter is not 
 yet finally settled, and there are difficulties in the way. 
 They can offer me only $1,000 a year, and I must, 
 out of it, hire my own house, at an expense of $75 to 
 $100 a year. Here the trustees offer me $1,500 a 
 year if I will stay, and a good house besides, which 
 would make the whole salary equivalent to $1,800; 
 and to-day I have had another offer from New York 
 city of $2,300. ... On the whole, I have written to 
 Bowdoin College, proposing to them if they will give 
 me $500 free and clear in addition to the salary, I will 
 accept their proposition, and I suppose that there is no 
 doubt that they will do it. In that case I should come 
 on next spring, in May or June.&quot; 
 
 This offer from Bowdoin College was additionally 
 attractive to Professor Stowe from the fact that it was 
 the college from which he graduated, and where some 
 of the happiest years of his life had been passed. 
 
 The professorship was one just established through 
 the gift of Mrs. Collins, a member of Bowdoin Street 
 Church in Boston, and named in her honor, the &quot; Col 
 lins Professorship of Natural and Revealed Religion.&quot; 
 
 It was impossible for Professor Stowe to leave Lane 
 Seminary till some one could be found to take his 
 place ; so it was determined that Mrs. Stowe, with three 
 of the children, should start for the East in April, and 
 having established the family in Brunswick, Professor 
 Stowe was to come on with the remaining children 
 when his engagements would permit.

 Stowe at her brother Henry s, at Brooklyn, April 29, 
 1850, show us that the journey was accomplished with 
 out special incident. 
 
 &quot; The boat got into Pittsburgh between four and 
 five on Wednesday. The agent for the Pennsylvania 
 Canal came on board and soon filled out our tickets, 
 calling my three chicks one and a* half. We had a 
 quiet and agreeable passage, and crossed the slides at 
 five o clock in the morning, amid exclamations of un 
 bounded delight from all the children, to whom the 
 mountain scenery was a new and amazing thing. We 
 reached Hollidaysburg about eleven o clock, and at two 
 ^o clock in the night were called up to get into the cars 
 .at Jacktown. Arriving at Philadelphia about three 
 o clock^ in the afternoon, we took the boat and railroad 
 line for New York. 
 
 &quot; At Lancaster we telegraphed to Brooklyn, and 
 when we arrived in New York, between ten and eleven 
 at night, Cousin Augustus met us and took us over to 
 Brooklyn. We had ridden three hundred miles since 
 two o clock that morning, and were very tired. ... I 
 am glad we came that way, for the children have seen 
 some of the finest scenery in our country. . . . Henry s 
 people are more than ever in love with him, and have 
 raised his salary to $3,300, and given him a beautiful 
 horse and carriage worth $600. . . . My health is 
 already improved by the journey, and I was able to 
 walk a good deal between the locks on the canal. As 
 to furniture, I think that we may safely afford an out 
 lay of $150, and that will purchase all that may be 
 necessary to set us up, and then we can get more as 
 we have means and opportunity. ... If I got any-

 thing for those pieces I wrote before coming away, I 
 would like to be advised thereof by you. . . . My plan 
 is to spend this week in Brooklyn, the next in Hart 
 ford, the next in Boston, and go on to Brunswick some 
 time in May or June.&quot; 
 
 May 18, 1850, we find her writing from Boston, 
 where she is staying with her brother, Rev. Edward 
 Beecher : 
 
 MY DEAR HUSBAND, I came here from Hartford 
 on Monday, and have since then been busily engaged 
 in the business of buying and packing furniture. 
 
 I expect to go to Brunswick next Tuesday night by 
 the Bath steamer, which way I take as the cheaper. 
 My traveling expenses, when I get to Brunswick, in 
 cluding everything, will have been seventy-six dollars. 
 . . . And now, lastly, my dear husband, you have 
 never been wanting ... in kindness, consideration, 
 and justice, and I want you to reflect calmly how great 
 a work has been imposed upon me at a time when my 
 situation particularly calls for rest, repose, and quiet. 
 
 To come alone such a distance with the whole charge 
 of children, accounts, and baggage ; to push my way 
 through hurrying crowds, looking out for trunks, and 
 bargaining with hackmen, has been a very severe trial 
 of my strength, to say nothing of the usual fatigues of 
 traveling. 
 
 It was at this time, and as a result of the experiences 
 of this trying period, that Mrs. Stowe wrote that little 
 tract dear to so many Christian hearts, &quot; Earthly Care 
 a Heavenly Discipline.&quot; 
 

<page 163>
132 REMOVAL TO BRUNSWICK. 
 
 On the eve of sailing for Brunswick, Mrs. Stowe 
 writes to Mrs. Sykes (Miss May) : &quot; I am wearied and 
 worn out with seeing to bedsteads, tables, chairs, mat 
 tresses, with thinking about shipping my goods and 
 making out accounts, and I have my trunk yet to pack, 
 as I go on board the Bath steamer this evening. I beg 
 you to look up Brunswick on the map ; it is about half 
 a day s ride in the cars from Boston. I expect to reach 
 there by the way of Bath by to-morrow forenoon. 
 There I have a house engaged and kind friends who 
 offer every hospitable assistance. Come, therefore, to 
 see me, and we will have a long talk in the pine woods, 
 and knit up the whole history from the place where we 
 left it.&quot; 
 
 Before leaving Boston she had written to her hus 
 band in Cincinnati : &quot; You are not able just now to 
 bear anything, my dear husband, therefore trust all to 
 me ; I never doubt or despair. I am already making 
 arrangements with editors to raise money. 
 
 &quot;I have sent some overtures to Wright. If he 
 accepts my pieces and pays you for them, take the 
 money and use it as you see necessary ; if not, be sure 
 and bring the pieces back to me. I am strong in 
 spirit, and God who has been with me in so many 
 straits will not forsake me now. I know Him well ; He 
 is my Father, and though I may be a blind and erring 
 child, He will help me for all that. My trust through 
 all errors and sins is in Him. He who helped poor 
 timid Jacob through all his fears and apprehensions, 
 who helped Abraham even when he sinned, who was 
 with David in his wanderings, and who held up the too 
 confident Peter wjien he began to sink, He will help

 us, and his arms are about us, so that we shall not sink, 
 my dear husbandry 
 
 May 29, 1850, she writes from Brunswick : &quot; After 
 a week of most incessant northeast storm, most dis 
 couraging and forlorn to the children, the sun has at 
 length come out. . . . There is a fair wind blowing, 
 and every prospect, therefore, that our goods will 
 arrive promptly from Boston, and that we shall be in 
 our own house by next week. Mrs. Upham 1 has done 
 everything for me, giving up time and strength and 
 taking charge of my affairs in a way without which we 
 could not have got along at all in a strange place and 
 in my present helpless condition. This family is de 
 lightful, there is such a perfect sweetness and quietude in 
 all its movements. Not a harsh word or hasty expres 
 sion is ever heard. It is a beautiful pattern of a Chris 
 tian family, a beautiful exemplification of religion. . . . 
 
 The events of the first summer in Brunswick are 
 graphically described by Mrs. Stowe in a letter written 
 to her sister-in-law, Mrs. George Beecher, December 17, 
 1850. 
 
 MY DEAR SISTER, Is it really true that snow is on 
 the ground and Christmas coming, and I have not 
 written unto thee, most dear sister? No, I don t 
 believe it ! I have n t been so naughty it s all a 
 mistake yes, written I must have and written I 
 have, too in the night-watches as I lay on my bed 
 such beautiful letters I wish you had only gotten 
 them ; but by day it has been hurry, hurry, hurry, and 
 drive, drive, drive ! or else the calm of a sick-room, 
 ever since last spring.

 I put off writing when your letter first came because 
 I meant to write you a long letter a full and com 
 plete one, and so days slid by, and became weeks, 
 and my little Charlie came . . . etc. and etc. ! ! ! 
 Sarah, when I look back, I wonder at myself, not that 
 I forget any one thing that I should remember, but 
 that I have remembered anything. From the time that 
 I left Cincinnati with my children to come forth to a 
 country that I knew not of almost to the present time, 
 it has seemed as if I could scarcely breathe, I was so 
 pressed with care. My head dizzy with the whirl of 
 railroads and steamboats ; then ten days sojourn in Bos 
 ton, and a constant toil and hurry in buying my furni 
 ture and equipments ; and then landing in Brunswick 
 in the midst of a drizzly, inexorable northeast storm, 
 and beginning the work of getting in order a deserted, 
 dreary, damp old house. All day long running from 
 one thing to another, as for example, thus : 
 
 Mrs. Stowe, how shall I make this lounge, and what 
 shall I cover the back with first ? 
 
 Mrs. Stowe. With the coarse cotton in the closet. 
 
 Woman. Mrs. Stowe, there is n t any more soap to 
 clean the windows. 
 
 Mrs. Stowe. Where shall I get soap ? 
 
 Here H., run up to the store and get two bars. 
 
 There is a man below wants to see Mrs. Stowe about 
 the cistern. Before you go down, Mrs. Stowe, just 
 show me how to cover this round end of the lounge. 
 
 There s a man up from the depot, and he says that 
 a box has come for Mrs. Stowe, and it s coming up to 
 the house ; will you come down and see about it ? 
 
 Mrs. Stowe, don t go till you have shown the man 
 

<page 166>
&quot;MID SCENES OF CONFUSION: 135 
 
 how to nail that carpet in the corner. He s nailed it 
 all crooked ; what shall he do ? The black thread is 
 all used up, and what shall I do about putting gimp on 
 the back of that sofa? Mrs. Stowe, there is a man 
 come with a lot of pails and tinware from Furbish ; will 
 you settle the bill now ? 
 
 Mrs. Stowe, here is a letter just come from Boston 
 inclosing that bill of lading ; the man wants to know 
 what he shall do with the goods. If you will tell me 
 what to say I will answer the letter for you. 
 
 Mrs. Stowe, the meat-man is at the door. Had n t 
 we better get a little beefsteak, or something, for din 
 ner ? 
 
 Shall Hatty go to Boardman s for some more black 
 thread ? 
 
 Mrs. Stowe, this cushion is an inch too wide for the 
 frame. What shall we do now ? 
 
 Mrs. Stowe, where are the screws of the black walnut 
 bedstead ? 
 
 Here s a man has brought in these bills for freight. 
 Will you settle them now ? 
 
 Mrs. Stowe, I don t understand using this great 
 needle. I can t make it go through the cushion ; it 
 sticks in the cotton. 
 
 Then comes a letter from my husband saying he is 
 sick abed, and all but dead ; don t ever expect to see 
 his family again ; wants to know how I shall manage, 
 in case I am left a widow ; knows we shall get in debt 
 and never get out ; wonders at my courage ; thinks I 
 am very sanguine ; warns me to be prudent, as there 
 won t be much to live on in case of his death, etc., etc., 
 etc. I read the letter and poke it into the stove, and 
 proceed. . . . 
 

<page 167>
136 REMOVAL TO BRUNSWICK. 
 
 Some of my adventures were quite funny ; as for 
 example : I had in my kitchen elect no sink, cistern, or 
 any other water privileges, so I bought at the cotton 
 factory two of the great hogsheads they bring oil in, 
 which here in Brunswick are often used for cisterns, 
 and had them brought up in triumph to my yard, and 
 was congratulating myself on my energy, when lo and 
 behold ! it was discovered that there was no cellar door 
 except one in the kitchen, which was truly a strait- and 
 narrow way, down a long pair of stairs. Hereupon, as 
 saith John Bunyan, I fell into a muse, how to get 
 my cisterns into my cellar. In days of chivalry I 
 might have got a knight to make me a breach through 
 the foundation walls, but that was not to be thought of 
 now, and my oil hogsheads standing disconsolately in 
 the yard seemed to reflect no great credit on my fore 
 sight. In this strait I fell upon a real honest Yankee 
 cooper, whom I besought, for the reputation of his 
 craft and mine, to take my hogsheads to pieces, carry 
 them down in staves, and set them up again, which the 
 worthy man actually accomplished one fair summer 
 forenoon, to the great astonishment of &quot; us Yankees-.&quot; 
 When my man came to put up the pump, he stared 
 very hard to see my hogsheads thus translated and 
 standing as innocent and quiet as could be in the cel 
 lar, and then I told him, in a very mild, quiet way, that 
 I got em taken to pieces and put together just as if 
 I had been always in the habit of doing such things. 
 Professor Smith came down and looked very hard at 
 them and then said, &quot; Well, nothing can beat a willful 
 woman.&quot; Then followed divers negotiations with a 
 very clever, but (with reverence) somewhat lazy gentle- 
 

<page 168>
JOHN TITCOMB. 137 
 
 man of jobs, who occupieth a carpenter s shop opposite 
 to mine. This same John Titcomb, my very good 
 friend, is a character peculiar to Yankeedom. He is 
 part owner and landlord of the house I rent, and con 
 nected by birth with all the best families in town ; a 
 man of real intelligence, and good education, a great 
 reader, and quite a thinker. Being of an ingenious 
 turn he does painting, gilding, staining, upholstery 
 jobs, varnishing, all in addition to his primary trade of 
 carpentry. But he is a man studious of ease, and fully 
 possessed with the idea that man wants but little here 
 below ; so he boards himself in his workshop on crack 
 ers and herring, washed down with cold water, and 
 spends his time working, musing, reading new publica 
 tions, and taking his comfort. In his shop you shall 
 see a joiner s bench, hammers, planes, saws, gimlets, 
 varnish, paint, picture frames, fence posts, rare old 
 china, one or two fine portraits of his ancestry, a book 
 case full of books, the tooth of a whale, an old spin 
 ning-wheel and spindle, a lady s parasol frame, a church 
 lamp to be mended, in short, Henry says Mr. Titcomb s 
 shop is like the ocean ; there is no end to the curiosities 
 in it. 
 
 In all my moving and fussing Mr. Titcomb has been 
 my right-hand man. Whenever a screw was loose, a 
 nail to be driven, a lock mended, a pane of glass set, 
 and these cases were manifold, he was always on hand. 
 But my sink was no fancy job, and I believe nothing 
 but a very particular friendship would have moved him 
 to undertake it. So this same sink lingered in a preca 
 rious state for some weeks, and when I had nothing 
 else to do, I used to call and do what I could in the 
 

<page 169>
138 REMOVAL TO BRUNSWICK. 
 
 way of enlisting the good man s sympathies in its be 
 half. 
 
 How many times I have been in and seated myself 
 in one of the old rocking-chairs, and talked first of the 
 news of the day, the railroad, the last proceedings in 
 Congress, the probabilities about the millennium, and 
 thus brought the conversation by little and little round 
 to my sink ! . . . because, till the sink was done, the 
 pump could not be put up, and we could n t have any 
 rain-water. Sometimes my courage would quite fail me 
 to introduce the subject, and I would talk of every 
 thing else, turn and get out of the shop, and then turn 
 back as if a thought had just struck my mind, and 
 say: 
 
 &quot; Oh, Mr. Titcomb ! about that sink?&quot; 
 
 &quot; Yes, ma am, I was thinking about going down 
 street this afternoon to look out stuff for it.&quot; 
 
 &quot; Yes, sir, if you would be good enough to get it 
 done as soon as possible ; we are in great need of it.&quot; 
 
 &quot; I think there s no hurry. I believe we are going 
 to have a dry time now, so that you could not catch 
 any water, and you won t need a pump at present.&quot; 
 
 These negotiations extended from the first of June 
 to the first of July, and at last my sink was completed, 
 and so also was a new house spout, concerning which I 
 had had divers communings with Deacon Dunning of 
 the Baptist church. Also during this time good Mrs. 
 Mitchell and myself made two sofas, or lounges, a bar 
 rel chair, divers bedspreads, pillow cases, pillows, bol 
 sters, mattresses ; we painted rooms ; we revarnished 
 furniture ; we what did n t we do ? 
 
 Then came on Mr. Stowe ; and then came the eighth

 of July and my little Charley. I was really glad for 
 an excuse to He in bed, for I was full tired, I can assure 
 you. Well, I was what folks call very comfortable for 
 two weeks, when my nurse had to leave me. . . . 
 
 During this time I have employed my leisure hours 
 in making up my engagements with newspaper editors. 
 I have written more than anybody, or I myself, would 
 have thought. I have taught an hour a day in our 
 school, and I have read two hours every evening to the 
 children. The children study English history in school, 
 and I am reading Scott s historic novels in their order. 
 To-night I finish the &quot;Abbot;&quot; shaU begin &quot; Kenil- 
 worth &quot; next week; yet I am constantly pursued and 
 haunted by the idea that I don t do anything. Since I 
 began this note I have been caUed off at least a dozen 
 times ; once for the fish-man, to buy a codfish ; once to 
 see a man who had brought me some barrels of apples ; 
 once to see a book-man ; then to Mrs. Upham, to see 
 about a drawing I promised to make for her ; then to 
 nurse the baby ; then into the kitchen to make a chow 
 der for dinner ; and now I am at it again, for nothing 
 but deadly determination enables me ever to write ; it 
 is rowing against wind and tide._ 
 
 I suppose you think now I have begun, I am never 
 going to stop, and in truth it looks like it ; but the 
 spirit moves now and I must obey. 
 
 Christmas is coming, and our little household is ah 1 
 alive with preparations ; every one collecting their lit 
 tle gifts with wonderful mystery and secrecy. . . . 
 
 To teh 1 the truth, dear, I am getting tired ; my neck 
 and back ache, and I must come to a close. 
 
 Your ready kindness to me in the spring I felt very

 140 REMOVAL TO BRUNSWICK. 
 
 much ; and why I did not have the sense to have sent 
 you one line just by way of acknowledgment, I m 
 sure I don t know ; I felt just as if I had, till I awoke, 
 and behold ! I had not. But, my dear, if my wits are 
 somewhat wool-gathering and unsettled, my heart is as 
 true as a star. I love you, and have thought of you 
 often. 
 
 This fall I have felt often sad, lonesome, both very 
 unusual feelings with me in these busy days ; but the 
 breaking away from my old home, and leaving father 
 and mother, and coming to a strange place affected me 
 naturally. In those sad hours my thoughts have often 
 turned to George; I have thought with encourage 
 ment of his blessed state, and hoped that I should soon 
 be there too. I have many warm and kind friends 
 here, and have been treated with great attention and 
 kindness. Brunswick is a delightful residence, and if 
 you come East next summer you must come to my new 
 home. George 1 would delight to go a-fishing with the 
 children, and see the ships, and sail in the sailboats, 
 and all that. 
 
 Give Aunt Harriet s love to him, and tell him when 
 he gets to be a painter to send me a picture. 
 
 Affectionately yours, H. STOWE. 
 
 The year 1850 is one memorable in the history of 
 our nation as well as in the quiet household that we 
 have followed in its pilgrimage from Cincinnati to 
 Brunswick.

 the statesmen and soldiers of the Revolution were no

 friends of negro slavery. In fact, the very principles 
 of the Declaration of Independence sounded the death- 
 knell of slavery forever^J No stronger utterances 
 against this national sin are to be found anywhere 
 than in the letters and published writings of Jefferson, 
 Washington, Hamilton, and Patrick Henry. &quot;Jeffer 
 son encountered difficulties greater than he could over 
 come, and after vain wrestlings the words that broke 
 from him, &amp;lt;T tremble for my country when I reflect 
 that God is just and that his justice cannot sleep for 
 ever, were the words of despair.y 
 
 66 It was the desire of Washington s heart that Vir 
 ginia should remove slavery by a public act ; and as 
 the prospects of a general emancipation grew more and 
 more dim ... he did all that he could by bequeathing 
 freedom to his own slaves.&quot; 
 
 Hamilton was one of the founders of the Manumis 
 sion Society, the object of which was the abolition of 
 slaves in the State of New York. Patrick Henry, 
 speaking of slavery, said : &quot; A serious view of this 
 subject gives a gloomy prospect to future times.&quot; Slav 
 ery was thought by the founders of our Republic to 
 be a dying institution, and all the provisions of the 
 Constitution touching slavery looked towards gradual 
 emancipation as an inevitable result of the growth of 
 the democracy. 
 
 From an economic standpoint slave labor had ceased 
 to be profitable. &quot; The whole interior of the Southern 
 States was languishing, and its inhabitants emigrating, 
 for want of some object to engage their attention and 
 employ their industry.&quot; The cultivation of cotton was 
 
 1 Bancroft s funeral oration on Lincoln. 
 

<page 173>
142 REMOVAL TO BRUNSWICK. 
 
 not profitable for the reason that there was no machine 
 for separating the seed from the fibre. 
 
 This was the state of affairs in 1793, when Eli 
 Whitney, a New England mechanic, at this time resid 
 ing in Savannah, Georgia, invented his cotton-gin, or a 
 machine to separate seed and fibre. &quot; The invention 
 of this machine at once set the whole country in active 
 motion.&quot; The effect of this invention may to some 
 extent be appreciated when we consider that whereas 
 in 1793 the Southern States produced only about five 
 or ten thousand bales, in 1859 they produced over five 
 millions. But with this increase of the cotton culture 
 the value of slave property was augmented. Slavery 
 grew and spread. In 1818 to 1821 it first became a 
 factor in politics during the Missouri compromise. By 
 this compromise slavery was not to extend north of 
 latitude 36 30 . From the time of this compromise 
 till the year 1833 the slavery agitation slumbered. 
 This was the year that the British set the slaves free 
 in their West Indian dependencies. This act caused 
 great uneasiness among the slaveholders of the South. 
 The National Anti-Slavery Society met in Philadelphia 
 and pronounced slavery a national sin, which could be 
 atoned for only by immediate emancipation. Such men 
 as Garrison and Lundy began a work of agitation that 
 was soon to set the whole nation in a ferment. From 
 this time on slavery became the central problem of 
 American history, and the line of cleavage in American 
 politics. The invasion of Florida when it was yet the 
 territory of a nation at peace with the United States, 
 and its subsequent purchase from Spain, the annexa-

<page 174>
THE COMPROMISE. 143 
 
 tion of Texas and the war with Mexico, were the direct 
 results of the policy of the pro-slavery party to increase 
 its influence and its territory. In 1849 the State of 
 California knocked at the door of the Union for admis 
 sion as a free State. This was bitterly opposed by the 
 slaveholders of the South, who saw in it a menace to 
 the slave-power from the fact that no slave State was 
 seeking admission at the same time. Both North and 
 South the feeling ran so high as to threaten the dis 
 memberment of the Union, and the scenes of violence 
 and bloodshed which were to come eleven years after 
 wards. It was to preserve the Union and avert the 
 danger of the hour that Henry Clay brought forward 
 his celebrated compromise measures in the winter of 
 1850. To conciliate the North, California was to be 
 admitted as a free State. To pacify the slaveholders 
 of the South, more stringent laws were to be enacted 
 &quot; concerning persons bound to service in one State and 
 escaping into another.&quot; 
 
 The 7th of March, 1850, Daniel Webster made his 
 celebrated speech, in which he defended this compro 
 mise, and the abolitionists of the North were filled with 
 indignation, which found its most fitting expression in 
 Whittier s &quot; Ichabod : &quot; &quot; So fallen, so lost, the glory / 
 from his gray hairs gone.&quot; ...&quot; When honor dies j 
 the man is dead.&quot; 
 
 It was in the midst of this excitement that Mrs. 
 Stowe, with her children and her modest hopes for the 
 future, arrived at the house of her brother, Dr. Edward 
 Beecher. 
 
 Dr. Beecher had been the intimate friend and sup 
 porter of Love joy, who had been murdered by the 
 

<page 175>
144 REMOVAL TO BRUNSWICK. 
 
 slaveholders at Alton for publishing an anti-slavery 
 paper. His soul was stirred to its very depths by the 
 iniquitous law which was at this time being debated 
 in Congress, a law which not only gave the slave 
 holder of the South the right to seek out and bring 
 back into slavery any colored person whom he claimed 
 as a slave, but commanded the people of the free 
 States to assist in this revolting business.j The most 
 frequent theme of conversation while Mrs. Stowe was 
 in Boston was this proposed law, and when she arrived 
 in Brunswick her soul was all on fire with indignation 
 at this new indignity and wrong about to be inflicted 
 by the slave-power on the innocent and defenseless. 
 
 After the passage of the Fugitive .. ffla.yg^A r.t, letter 
 after letter was received by Mrs. Stowe in Brunswick 
 from Mrs. Edward Beecher and other friends, describ 
 ing the heart-rending scenes which were the inevitable 
 results of the enforcement of this terrible law. Cities 
 were more available for the capturing of escaped slaves 
 than the country, and Boston, which claimed to have 
 the cradle of liberty, opened her doors to the slave- 
 hunters. The sorrow and anguish caused thereby no 
 pen could describe. Families were broken up. Some 
 hid in garrets and cellars. Some fled to the wharves 
 and embarked in ships and sailed for Europe. Others 
 went to Canada. One poor fellow who was doing good 
 business as a crockery merchant, and supporting his 
 family well, when he got notice that his master, whom 
 he had left many years before, was after him, set out 
 for Canada in midwinter on foot, as he did not dare to 
 take a public conveyance. He froze both of his feet 
 on the journey, and they had to be amputated. Mrs. 
 

<page 176>
THE FUGITIVE SLAVE LAW. 145 
 
 Edward Beecher, in a letter to Mrs. Stowe s son, writ- 
 ingjpf this period, says : 
 
 I &quot; I had been nourishing an anti-slavery spirit since 
 Love joy was murdered for publishing in his paper 
 articles against slavery and intemperance, when our 
 home was in Illinois.^ These terrible things which 
 were going on in Boston were well calculated to rouse 
 up this spirit. What can I do ? I thought. Not 
 much myself, but I know one who can. So I wrote 
 several letters to your mother, telling her of various 
 heart-rending events caused by the enforcement of the 
 Fugitive Slave Law. I remember distinctly saying in 
 one of them, Now, Hattie, if I could use a pen as you 
 can, I would write something that would make this 
 whole nation feel what an accursed thing slavery is. 
 . . . When we lived in Boston your mother often 
 visited us. ... Several numbers of f Uncle Tom s 
 Cabin were written in your Uncle Edward s study at 
 these times, and read to us from the manuscripts.&quot; 
 
 A member of Mrs. Stowe s family well remembers 
 the scene in the little parlor in Brunswick when the 
 letter alluded to was received. Mrs. Stowe herself read 
 it aloud to the assembled family, and when she came 
 to the passage, &quot; I would write something that would 
 make this whole nation feel what an accursed thing 
 slavery is,&quot; Mrs. Stowe rose up from her chair, crush- - 
 ing the letter in her hand, and with an expression on 
 her face that stamped itself on the mind of her child, 
 said : &quot; I will write something. I will if I live.&quot;_ 
 
 This was the origin of &quot; Uncle Tom s Cabin,&quot; and 
 Professor Cairnes has well said in his admirable work, 
 &quot;The Slave Power,&quot; &quot;The Fugitive Slave Law has 
 

<page 177>
146 REMOVAL TO BRUNSWICK. 
 
 been to the slave power a questionable gain. Among 
 its first-fruits was Uncle Tom s Cabin. 
 
 The purpose of writing a story that should make the 
 the whole nation feel that slavery was an accursed 
 thing was not immediately carried out. In December, 
 1850, Mrs. Stowe writes : &quot; Tell sister Katy I thank 
 her for her letter and will answer it. As long as the 
 baby sleeps with me nights I can t do much at any 
 thing, but I will do it at last. I will write that thing 
 if I live. 
 
 &quot; What are folks in general saying about the slave 
 law, and the stand taken by Boston ministers univer 
 sally, except Edward ? 
 
 &quot; To me it is incredible, amazing, mournful ! ! I 
 feel as if I should be willing to sink with it, were all 
 this sin and misery to sink in the sea. ... I wish 
 father would come on to Boston, and preach on the 
 Fugitive Slave Law, as he once preached on the slave- 
 trade, when I was a little girl in Litchfield. I sobbed 
 aloud in one pew and Mrs. Judge Reeves in another. 
 I wish some Martin Luther would arise to set this com 
 munity right.&quot; 
 
 December 22, 1850, she writes to her husband in 
 Cincinnati : &quot; Christmas has passed, not without many 
 thoughts of our absent one. If you want a descrip 
 tion of the scenes in our family preceding it, vide a 
 New Year s Story/ which I have sent to the New 
 York Evangelist. I am sorry that in the hurry of 
 getting oft* this piece and one for the * Era you were 
 neglected.&quot; The piece for the &quot; Era &quot; was a humorous 
 article called &quot; A Scholar s Adventures in the Country,&quot; 
 being, in fact, a picture drawn from life and embody- 
 

<page 178>
FIRST WINTER IN MAINE. 147 
 
 ing Professor Stowe s efforts in the department of agri 
 culture while in Cincinnati. 
 
 December 29, 1850. &quot; We have had terrible weather 
 here. I remember such a storm when I was a child in 
 Litchfield. Father and mother went to Warren, and 
 were almost lost in the snowdrifts. 
 
 &quot; Sunday night I rather watched than slept. The 
 wind howled, and the house rocked just as our old 
 Litchfield house used to. The cold has been so intense 
 that the children have kept begging to get up from 
 table at meal-times to warm feet and fingers. Our air 
 tight stoves warm all but the floor, heat your head 
 and keep your feet freezing. If I sit by the open fire 
 in the parlor my back freezes, if I sit in my bedroom 
 and try to write my head aches and my feet are cold. 
 I am projecting a sketch for the Era on the capa 
 bilities of liberated blacks to take care of themselves. 
 Can t you find out for me how much Willie Watson 
 has paid for the redemption of his friends, and get any 
 items in figures of that kind that you can pick up in 
 Cincinnati ? . . . When I have a headache and feel 
 sick, as I do to-day, there is actually not a place in the 
 house where I can lie down and take a nap without be 
 ing disturbed. Overhead is the school-room, next door 
 is the dining-room, and the girls practice there two 
 hours a day. If I lock my door and lie down some one 
 is sure to be rattling the latch before fifteen minutes 
 have passed. . . . There is no doubt in my mind that 
 our expenses this year will come two hundred dollars, 
 if not three, beyond our salary. We shall be able to 
 come through, notwithstanding; but I don t want to 
 feel obliged to work as hard every year as I have this. 
 

<page 179>
148 REMOVAL TO BRUNSWICK. 
 
 I can earn four hundred dollars a year by writing, but 
 I don t want to feel that I must, and when weary with 
 teaching the children, and tending the baby, and buy 
 ing provisions, and mending dresses, and darning stock 
 ings, sit down and write a piece for some paper.&quot; 
 
 January 12, 1851, Mrs. Stowe again writes to Pro 
 fessor Stowe at Cincinnati : &quot; Ever since we left Cin 
 cinnati to come here the good hand of God has been 
 visibly guiding our way. Through what difficulties 
 have we been brought ! Though we knew not where 
 means were to come from, yet means have been fur 
 nished every step of the way, and in every time of 
 need. I was just in some discouragement with regard 
 to my writing ; thinking that the editor of the Era 
 was overstocked with contributors, and would not want 
 my services another year, and lo ! he sends me one 
 hundred dollars, and ever so many good words with it. 
 Our income this year will be seventeen hundred dol 
 lars in all, and I hope to bring our expenses within 
 thirteen hundred.&quot; 
 
 It was in the month of February after these words 
 were written that Mrs. Stowe was seated at communion 
 service in the college church at Brunswick. Suddenly, 
 like the unrolling of a picture, the scene of the death 
 of Uncle Tom passed before her mind. So strongly 
 was she affected that it was with difficulty she could 
 keep from weeping aloud. Immediately on returning 
 home she took pen and paper and wrote out the vision 
 which had been as it were blown into her mind as by 
 the rushing of a mighty wind. Gathering her family 
 about her she read what she had written. Her two 
 little ones of ten and twelve years of age broke into 
 

<page 180>
LETTER TO FREDERICK DOUGLASS. 149 
 
 convulsions of weeping, one of them saying through 
 his sobs, &quot; Oh, mamma ! slavery is the most cruel thing 
 in the world.&quot; Thus Uncle Tom was ushered into the _ 
 world, and it was, as we said at the beginning, a cry, 
 an immediate, an involuntary expression of deep, im 
 passioned feeling, j 
 
 Twenty-five years afterwards Mrs. Stowe wrote in a 
 letter to one of her children, of this period of her life : 
 &quot; I well remember the winter you were a baby and I 
 was writing Uncle Tom s Cabin. My heart was burst- / 
 ing with tne anguish excited by the cruelty and in jus- / 
 tice our nation was showing to the slave, and praying 
 God to let me do a little and to cause my cry for them - 
 to be heard. I remember many a night weeping over 
 you as you lay sleeping beside me, and I thought of 
 the slave mothers whose babes were torn from them.&quot; 
 
 It was not till the following April that the first 
 chapter of the story was finished and sent on to the 
 &quot; National Era&quot; at Washington. 
 
 In July Mrs. Stowe wrote to ^Frederick Douglass the 
 following letter, which is given entire as the best possi 
 ble introduction to the history of the career of that 
 memorable work, &quot; Uncle Tom s Cabin.&quot; 
 
 BRUNSWICK, July 9, 1851. 
 
 FREDERICK DOUGLASS, ESQ. : 
 
 Sir, You may perhaps have noticed in your ed 
 itorial readings a series of articles that I am furnish 
 ing for the &quot; Era &quot; under the title of &quot; Uncle Tom s . 
 Cabin, or Life among the Lowly.&quot; 
 
 In the course of my story the scene will fall upon a 
 cotton plantation. I am very desirous, therefore, to 
 

<page 181>
150 REMOVAL TO BRUNSWICK. 
 
 information from one who has been an actual 
 laborer on one, and it occurred to me that in the circle 
 of your acquaintance there might be one who would 
 be able to communicate to me some such information 
 as I desire. I have before me an able paper written 
 by a Southern planter, in which the details and modus 
 operandi are given from his point of sight. I am 
 anxious to have something more from another stand 
 point. I wish to be able to make a picture that shall 
 be graphic and true to nature in its detailsA Such a 
 person as Henry Bibb, if in the country, might give 
 me just the kind of information I desire. You may 
 possibly know of some other person. I will subjoin 
 to this letter a list of questions, which in that case you 
 will do me a favor by inclosing to the individual, with 
 the request that he will at earliest convenience answer 
 them. 
 
 For some few weeks past I have received your paper 
 through the mail, and have read it with great interest, 
 and desire to return my acknowledgments for it. It 
 will be a pleasure to me at some time when less occu 
 pied to contribute something to its columns. I have 
 noticed with regret your sentiments on two subjects 
 the church and African colonization, . . . with the 
 more regret because I think you have a considerable 
 share of reason for your feelings on both these sub 
 jects ; but I would willingly, if I could, modify your 
 views on both points. 
 
 In the first place you say the church is &quot; pro-slav 
 ery.&quot; There is a sense in which this may be true. 
 The American church of all denominations, taken as 
 a body, comprises the best and most conscientious peo- 
 

<page 182>
LETTER TO FREDERICK DOUGLASS. 151 
 
 pie in the country. I do not say it comprises none but 
 these, or that none such are found out of it, but 
 only if a census were taken of the purest and most high 
 principled men and women of the country, the majority 
 of them would be found to be professors of religion in 
 some of the various Christian denominations. This 
 fact has given to the church great weight in this coun 
 try the general and predominant spirit of intelli 
 gence and probity and piety of its majority has given 
 it that degree of weight that it has the power to de 
 cide the great moral questions of the day. Whatever 
 it unitedly and decidedly sets itself against as moral 
 evil it can put down. In this sense the church is re 
 sponsible for the sin of slavery. Dr. Barnes has beau 
 tifully and briefly expressed this on the last page of 
 his work on slavery, when he says : &quot; Not all the force 
 out of the church could sustain slavery an hour if it 
 were not sustained in it.&quot; It then appears that the 
 church has the power to put an end to this evil and 
 does not do it. In this sense she may be said to be 
 pro-slavery. But the church has the same power over 
 intemperance, and Sabbath-breaking, and sin of all 
 kinds. There is not a doubt that if the moral power 
 of the church were brought up to the New Testament 
 standpoint it is sufficient to put an end to all these as 
 well as to slavery. But I would ask you, Would you 
 consider it a fair representation of the Christian church 
 in this country to say that it is pro-intemperance, pro- 
 Sabbath-breaking, and pro everything that it might put 
 down if it were in a higher state of moral feeling ? If 
 you should make a list of all the abolitionists of the 
 country, I think that you would find a majority of 
 

<page 183>

 them in the church certainly some of the most in 
 fluential and efficient ones are ministers. 
 
 I am a minister s daughter, and a minister s wife, 
 and* I have had six brothers in the ministry (one is in 
 heaven) ; I certainly ought to know something of the 
 feelings of ministers on this subject. I was a child in 
 1820 when the Missouri question was agitated, and one 
 of the strongest and deepest impressions on my mind 
 was that made by my father s sermons and prayers, and 
 the anguish of his soul for the poor slave at that time. 
 I remember his preaching drawing tears down the 
 hardest faces of the old farmers in his congregation. 
 
 I well remember his prayers morning and evening in 
 the family for &quot; poor, oppressed, bleeding Africa,&quot; that 
 the time of her deliverance might come ; prayers offered 
 with strong crying and tears, and which indelibly im 
 pressed my heart and made me what I am from my 
 very soul, the enemy of all slavery. Every brother I 
 have has been in his sphere a leading anti-slavery man. 
 One of them was to the last the bosom friend and 
 counselor of Love joy. /_As for myself and husband, we 
 have for the last seventeen years lived on the border of 
 a slave State, and we have never shrunk from the fugi 
 tives, and we have helped them with all we had to give.^ 
 I have received the children of liberated slaves into a 
 family school, and taught them with my own children, 
 and it has been the influence that we found in th&^ 
 church and by the altar that has made us do all this.J 
 Gather up all the sermons that have been published on 
 this offensive and unchristian Fugitive Slave Law, and 
 you will find that those against it are numerically more 
 than those in its favor, and yet some of the strongest 
 

<page 184>
A HEART-WORK. 153 
 
 opponents have not published their sermons. Out of 
 thirteen ministers who meet with my husband weekly 
 for discussion of moral subjects, only three are found 
 who will acknowledge or obey this law in any shape. 
 
 After all, my brother, the strength and hope of your 
 oppressed race does lie in the church in hearts united 
 to Him of whom . it is said, &quot; He shall spare the souls 
 of the needy, and precious shall their blood be in his 
 sight.&quot; Everything is against you, but Jesus Christ is 
 for you, and He has not forgotten his church, mis 
 guided and erring though it be. I have looked all the 
 field over with despairing eyes ; I see no hope but in 
 Him. This movement must and will become a purely 
 religious one. The light will spread in churches, the 
 tone of feeling will rise, Christians North and South 
 will give up all connection with, and take up their tes 
 timony against, slavery, and thus the work will be 
 done. 
 
 This letter gives us a conception of the. state of 
 moral and religious exaltation of the heart and mind 
 out of which flowed chapter after chapter of that won 
 derful story. It all goes to prove the correctness of 
 the position from which we started, that &quot; Uncle Tom s 
 Cabin &quot; came from the heart rather than the head. It 
 was an outburst of deep feeling, a cry in the darkness. 
 The writer no more thought of style or literary excel 
 lence than the mother who rushes into the street and 
 cries for help to save her children from a burning 
 house thinks of the teachings of the rhetorician or the 
 elocutionist. 
 
 A few years afterwards Mrs. Stowe, writing of this 
 

<page 185>
154 REMOVAL TO BRUNSWICK. 
 
 story, said, &quot; This story is to show how Jesus Christ, 
 who liveth and was dead, and now is alive and forever- 
 more, has still a mother s love for the poor and lowly, 
 and that no man can sink so low but that Jesus Christ 
 will stoop to take his hand. ^Who so low, who so pppr^ 
 who so despised as the American slave ? The law 
 almost denies his existence as a person, and regards 
 him for the most part as less than a man a mere 
 thing, the^propeji^zijQf . another. The law forbids him 
 to read or write, to hold property, to make a contract, 
 or even to form a legal marriage. It takes from him 
 all legal right to the wife of his bosom, the children of 
 his body. He can do nothing, possess nothing, acquire 
 nothing, but what must belong to his master. Yet 
 even to this slave Jesus Christ stoops, from where he 
 sits at the right hand of the Father, and says, ( Fear 
 not, thou whom man despiseth, for I am thy brother. 
 Fear not, for I have redeemed thee, I have called thee 
 by thy name, thou art mine. 
 
 yj&quot; Uncle Tom s Cabin &quot; is a work of religion ; the 
 fundamental principles of the gospel applied to the 
 burning question of negro slavery?\ It sets forth those 
 principles of the Declaration of Independence that 
 made Jefferson, Hamilton, Washington, and Patrick 
 Henry anti-slavery men ; not in the language of the 
 philosopher, but in a series of pictures. Mrs. Stowe 
 spoke to the understanding and moral sense through 
 the imagination. 
 
 r~~&quot; Uncle Tom s Cabin &quot; made the enforcement of the 
 Fugitive Slave Law an impossibility. ^ It aroused the 
 public sentiment of the world by presenting in the con 
 crete that which had been a mere series of abstract 
 

<page 186>
POWER OF THE CONCRETE. 155 
 
 propositions. It was, as we have already said, an ap 
 peal to the imagination through a series of pictures. 
 People are like children, and understand pictures better 
 than words. Some one rushes into your dining-room 
 while you are at breakfast and cries out, &quot; Terrible 
 railroad accident, forty killed and wounded, six were 
 burned alive.&quot; 
 
 &quot; Oh, shocking ! dreadful ! &quot; you exclaim, and yet 
 go quietly on with your roUs and coffee. But suppose 
 you stood at that instant by the wreck, and saw the 
 mangled dead, and heard the piercing shrieks of the 
 wounded, you would be faint and dizzy with the intol 
 erable spectacle. 
 
 _ So &quot; Uncle Tom s Cabin &quot; made the crack of the 
 slavedriver s whip, and the cries of the tortured blacks 
 ring in every household in the land, till human hearts 
 could endure it no longer.

 UNCLE TOM S CABIN, 1852.

 TORY MESSAGES. KIND WORDS FROM ABROAD. MRS. STOWE 
 TO THE EARL OF CARLISLE. LETTERS FROM AND TO LORD 
 SHAFTESBURY. CORRESPONDENCE WITH ARTHUR HELPS. 
 
 THE wonderful story that was begun in the &quot; Na 
 tional Era/ June 5, 1851, and was announced to run 
 for about three months, was not completed in that 
 paper until April 1, 1852.^) It had been contemplated 
 as a mere magazine tale of perhaps a dozen chapters, 
 but once begun it could no more be controlled than the 
 waters of the swollen Mississippi, bursting through a 
 crevasse in its levees. The intense interest excited by 
 the story, the demands made upon the author for more 
 facts, the unmeasured words of encouragement to keep 
 on in her good work that poured in from all sides, and 
 above all the ever-growing conviction that she had been 
 intrusted with a great and holy mission, compelled her 
 to keep on until the humble tale had assumed the pro 
 portions df a volume prepared to stand among the most 
 notable books in the world. As Mrs. Stowe has since 
 repeatedly said, &quot; I could not control the story ; it 
 wrote itself ; &quot; or &quot;I the author of Uncle Tom s 
 Cabin ? No, indeed. The Lord himself wrote it, 
 and I was but the humblest of instruments in his hand. 
 To Him alone should be given all the praise.&quot; 
 

<page 188>
THE NATIONAL ERA. 157 
 
 Although the publication of the &quot; National Era &quot; has 
 been long since suspended, the journal was in those 
 days one of decided literary merit and importance. On 
 its title-page, with the name of Dr. Gamaliel Bailey as 
 editor, appeared that of John Greenleaf Whittier as 
 corresponding editor. In its columns Mrs. Southworth 
 made her first literary venture, while Alice and Phosbe 
 Gary:, Grace Greenwood, and a host of other well-known 
 names were published with that of Mrs. Stowe, which 
 appeared last of all in its prospectus for 1851. 
 
 Before the conclusion of &quot; Uncle Tom s Cabin &quot; Mrs. 
 Stowe had so far outstripped her contemporaries that 
 her work was pronounced by competent judges to be 
 the most powerful production ever contributed to the 
 magazine literature of this country, and she stood in 
 the foremost rank of American writers. 
 
 After finishing her story Mrs. Stowe penned the fol 
 lowing appeal to its more youthful readers, and its serial 
 publication was concluded : 
 
 &quot; The author of ( Uncle Tom s Cabin must now take 
 leave of a wide circle of friends whose faces she has 
 never seen, but whose sympathies coming to her from 
 afar have stimulated and cheered her in her work. 
 
 &quot; The thought of the pleasant family circles that she 
 has been meeting in spirit week after week has been a 
 constant refreshment to her, and she cannot leave them 
 without a farewell. 
 
 &quot; In particular the dear children who have followed 
 her story have her warmest love. / Dear children, you 
 will soon be men and women, and I hope that you will 
 learn from this story always to remember and pity the 
 poor and oppressed. When you grow up, show your 
 

<page 189>
158 UNCLE TOM S CABIN. 
 
 pity by doing all you can for them. Never, if you can 
 help it, let a colored child be shut out from school or 
 treated with neglect and contempt on account of his 
 color. Remember the sweet example of little Eva, and 
 try to feel the same regard for all that she did. Then, 
 when you grow up, I hope the foolish and unchristian 
 prejudice against people merely on account of their 
 complexion will be done away withT) 
 
 &quot; Farewell, dear children, until we meet again.&quot; 
 
 With the completion of the story the editor of the 
 &quot; Era &quot; wrote : &quot; Mrs. Stowe has at last brought her 
 great work to a close. We do not recollect any pro 
 duction of an American writer that has excited more 
 general and profound interest.&quot; 
 
 For the story as a serial the author received $300. 
 In the meantime, however, it had attracted the atten 
 tion of Mr. John P. Jewett, a Boston publisher, who 
 promptly made overtures for its publication in book 
 form. He offered Mr. and Mrs. Stowe a half share in 
 the profits, provided they would share with him the ex 
 pense of publication. This was refused by Professor 
 Stowe, who said he was altogether too poor to assume 
 any such risk ; and the agreement finally made was that 
 the author should receive a ten per cent, royalty upon 
 all sales. 
 
 Mrs. Stowe had no reason to hope for any large 
 pecuniary gain from this publication, for it was practi 
 cally her first book. To be sure, she had, in 1832, pre 
 pared a small school geography for a Western publisher, 
 and ten years later the Harpers had brought out her 
 &quot; Mayflower.&quot; Still, neither of these had been suffi 
 ciently remunerative to cause her to regard literary work 
 

<page 190>
THE FIRST EDITION. 159 
 
 as a money-making business, and in regard to this new 
 contract she writes : &quot; I did not know until a week after 
 ward precisely what terms Mr. Stowe had made, and I 
 did not care. I had the most perfect indifference to 
 the bargain.&quot; 
 
 The agreement was signed March 13, 1852, and, as 
 by arrangement with the &quot; National Era &quot; the book 
 publication of the story was authorized before its com 
 pletion as a serial, the first edition of five thousand 
 copies was issued on the twentieth of the same month. 
 
 In looking over the first semi-annual statement pre 
 sented by her publishers we find Mrs. Stowe charged, 
 a few days before the date of publication of her book, 
 with &quot; one copy U. T. C. cloth $.56,&quot; and this was the 
 first copy of &quot; Uncle Tom s Cabin &quot; ever sold in book 
 form. Five days earlier we find her charged with one 
 copy of Horace Mann s speeches. In writing of this 
 critical period of her life Mrs. Stowe says : 
 
 &quot; After sending the last proof-sheet to the office I 
 sat alone reading Horace Mann s eloquent plea for these 
 young men and women, then about to be consigned to 
 the slave warehouse of Bruin & Hill in Alexandria, Va., 
 a plea impassioned, eloquent, but vain, as all other 
 pleas on that side had ever proved in all courts hitherto. 
 It seemed that there was no hope, that nobody would 
 hear, nobody would read, nobody pity ; that this fright 
 ful system, that had already pursued its victims into 
 the free States, might at last even threaten them in 
 Canada.&quot; 1 
 
 Filled with this fear, she determined to do all that 
 
 1 Introduction to Illustrated Edition of Uncle Tom, p. xiii. (Hough- 
 ton, Osgood & Co., 1879.) 
 

<page 191>
160 UNCLE TOM S CABIN. 
 
 one woman might to enlist the sympathies of England 
 for the cause, and to avert, even as a remote contin 
 gency, the closing of Canada as a haven of refuge for 
 the oppressed. To this end she at once wrote letters 
 to Prince Albert, to the Duke of Argyll, to the Earls 
 of Carlisle and Shaftesbury, to Macaulay, Dickens, and 
 others whom she knew to be interested in the cause of 
 anti-slavery. These she ordered to be sent to their 
 several addresses, accompanied by the very earliest 
 copies of her book that should be printed. 
 
 Then, having done what she could, and committed 
 the result to God, she calmly turned her attention to 
 other affairs. 
 
 F In the mean time the fears of the author as to whether 
 or not her book would be read were quickly dispelled. 
 Three thousand copies were sold the very first day, a 
 . second edition was issued the following week, a third on 
 the 1st of April, and within a year one hundred and 
 twenty editions, or over three hundred thousand copies 
 of the book, had been issued and sold in this country. 
 Almost in a day the poor professor s wife had become 
 the most talked-of woman in the world, her influence for 
 good was spreading to its remotest corners, and hence 
 forth she was to be a public character, whose every 
 movement would be watched with interest, and whose 
 every word would be quoted. The long, weary struggle 
 with poverty was to be hers no longer ; for, in seeking 
 to aid the oppressed, she had also so aided herself that 
 within four months from the time her book was pub 
 lished it had yielded her $10,000 in royalties. 
 
 Now letters regarding the wonderful book, and ex 
 pressing all shades of opinion concerning it, began to

LETTERS OF COMMENDATION. 161 
 
 pour in upon the author. Her lifelong friend, whose 
 words we have already so often quoted, wrote : 
 
 &quot; I sat up last night until long after one o clock read 
 ing and finishing Uncle Tom s Cabin. I could not 
 leave it any more than I could have left a dying child, 
 nor could I restrain an almost hysterical sobbing for an 
 hour after I laid my head upon my pillow. I thought 
 I was a thorough-going abolitionist before, but your 
 book has awakened so strong a feeling of indignation 
 and of compassion that I never seem to have had any 
 feeling on this subject until now.&quot; 
 
 The poet Longfellow wrote : 
 
 I congratulate you most cordially upon the immense 
 success and influence of &quot; Uncle Tom s Cabin.&quot; It is 
 one of the greatest triumphs recorded in literary his 
 tory, to say nothing of the higher triumph of its moral 
 effect. 
 
 With great regard, and friendly remembrance to Mr. 
 Stowe, I remain, 
 
 Yours most truly, 
 
 HENRY W. LONGFELLOW. 
 
 Whittier wrote to Garrison : 
 
 &quot; What a glorious work Harriet Beecher Stowe has 
 wrought. Thanks for the Fugitive Slave Law ! Better 
 would it be far slavery if that law had never been en 
 acted ; for it gave occasion for Uncle Tom s Cabin. 
 
 Garrison wrote to Mrs. Stowe : 
 
 &quot; I estimate the value of anti-slavery writing by the 
 abuse it brings. Now all the defenders of slavery have 
 let me alone and are abusing you.&quot; 
 

<page 195>
162 UNCLE TOM S CABIN. 
 
 To Mrs. Stowe, Whittier wrote : 
 
 Ten thousand thanks for thy immortal book. My 
 young friend Mary Irving (of the &quot; Era &quot;) writes me 
 that she has been reading it to some twenty young 
 ladies, daughters of Louisiana slaveholders, near New 
 Orleans, and amid the scenes described in it, and that 
 they, with one accord, pronounce it true. 
 Truly thy friend, 
 
 JOHN G. WHITTIER. 
 
 From Thomas Wentworth Higginson came the fol 
 lowing : 
 
 To have written at once the most powerful of con 
 temporary fictions and the most efficient of anti-slavery 
 tracts is a double triumph in literature and philan- 
 vthropy, to which this country has heretofore seen no 
 parallel. 
 
 Yours respectfully and gratefully, 
 
 T. W. HIGGINSON. 
 
 A few days after the publication of the book, Mrs. 
 Stowe, writing from Boston to her husband in Bruns 
 wick, says : &quot; I have been in such a whirl ever since I 
 have been here. I found business prosperous. Jewett 
 animated. He has been to Washington and conversed 
 with all the leading senators, Northern and Southern. 
 , Seward told him it was the greatest book of the times, 
 or something of that sort, and he and Sumner went 
 around with him to recommend it to Southern men and 
 get them to read it.&quot; 
 

<page 196>
OPINIONS AT THE SOUTH. 163 
 
 It is true that with these congratulatory and com 
 mendatory letters came hosts of others, threatening and 
 insulting, from the Haleys and Legrees of the country. 
 
 Of them Mrs. Stowe said : &quot; They were so curiously 
 compounded of blasphemy, cruelty, and obscenity, that 
 their like could only be expressed by John Bunyan s 
 account of the speech of Apollyon : ( He spake as a 
 dragon. &quot; 
 
 A correspondent of the &quot; National Era &quot; wrote : 
 &quot; Uncle Tom s Cabin is denounced by time-serving 
 preachers as a meretricious work. Will you not come \ 
 out in defense of it and roh 1 back the tide of vitupera 
 tion?&quot; 
 
 To this the editor answered : &quot; We should as soon 
 think of coming out in defense of Shakespeare.&quot; 
 
 Several attempts were made in the South to write 
 books con^overting^^ncle Tom s Cabin,&quot; and show 
 ing a much brighter side of. the slavery question, but 
 they all fell flat and were left unread. Of one of 
 them, a clergyman of Charleston, S. C., wrote in a pri 
 vate letter : 
 
 &quot; I have read two columns in the Southern Press 
 of Mrs. Eastman s Aunt Phillis Cabin, or Southern 
 Life as it is/ with the remarks of the editor. I have 
 no comment to make on it, as that is done by itself. 
 The editor might have saved himself being writ down 
 an ass by the public if he had withheld his nonsense. 
 If the two columns are a fair specimen of Mrs. East 
 man s book, I pity her attempt and her name as an 
 author.&quot; 
 
 In due time Mrs. Stowe began to receive answers to 
 the letters she had forwarded with copies of her book 
 

<page 197>
164 UNCLE TOM S CABIN. 
 
 to prominent men in England, and these were without 
 exception flattering and encouraging. Through his 
 private secretary Prince Albert acknowledged with 
 thanks the receipt of his copy, and promised to read it. 
 Succeeding mails brought scores of letters from English 
 men of letters and statesmen. Lord^arlislejffirojte : 
 &quot; I return my deep and solemn thanks to Almighty 
 God who has led and enabled you to write such a book. 
 I do feel indeed the most thorough assurance that in 
 his good Providence such a book cannot have been 
 written in vain. I have long felt that slavery is by 
 far the topping question of the world and age we live 
 in, including all that is most thrilling in heroism and 
 most touching in distress ; in short, the real epic of the 
 universe. The self-interest of the parties most nearly 
 concerned on the one hand, the apathy and ignorance 
 of unconcerned observers on the other, have left these 
 august pretensions to drop very much out of sight. 
 Hence my rejoicing that a writer has appeared who 
 will be read and must be felt, and that happen what 
 may to the transactions of slavery they will no longer 
 
 be suppressed-!l3 
 
 To this letter, of which but an extract has been 
 given, Mrs. Stowe sent the following reply : 
 
 MY LORD, It is not with the common pleasure of 
 gratified authorship that I say how much I am gratified 
 by the receipt of your very kind communication with 
 regard to my humble efforts in the cause of humanity. 
 The subject is one so grave, so awful the success of 
 what I have written has been so singular and so unex 
 pected that I can scarce retain a self -consciousness 
 

<page 198>
LETTER TO LORD CARLISLE. 165 
 
 and am constrained to look upon it all as the work of a 
 Higher Power, who, when He pleases, can accomplish 
 his results by the feeblest instruments. I am glad of 
 anything which gives notoriety to the book, because it 
 Jg_a__plg for f.hp rlmnli ^nd^the helpless ! I amglacT 
 particularly of notoriety in England because I see with 
 what daily increasing power England s opinion is to act 
 on this country. No one can tell but a native born 
 here by what an infinite complexity of ties, nerves, and 
 ligaments this terrible evil is bound in one body politic ; 
 how the slightest touch upon it causes even the free 
 States to thrill and shiver, what a terribly corrupting 
 and tempting power it has upon the conscience and 
 moral sentiment even of a free community. Nobody 
 can tell the thousand ways in which by trade, by fam 
 ily affinity, or by political expediency, the free part of 
 our country is constantly tempted to complicity with 
 the slaveholding part. It is a terrible thing to become 
 used to hearing the enormities of slavery, to hear of 
 things day after day that one would think the sun 
 should hide his face from, and yet, to get used to them, 
 to discusss them coolly, to dismiss them coolly. For 
 example, the sale of intelligent, handsome colored 
 females for vile purposes, facts of the most public 
 nature, have made this a perfectly understood matter 
 in our Northern States. I have now, myself, under 
 charge and educating, two girls of whose character any 
 mother might be proud, who have actually been res 
 cued from this sale in the New Orleans market. 
 
 I desire to inclose a tract 1 in which I sketched down 
 a few incidents in the history of the family to which 
 1 Afterwards embodied in the Key to Uncle Tom s Cabin. 
 

<page 199>
166 UNCLE TOM S CABIN. 
 
 these girls belong ; it will show more than words can 
 the kind of incident to which I allude. The tract is 
 not a published document, only printed to assist me in 
 raising money, and it would not, at present, be for the 
 good of the parties to have it published even in Eng 
 land. 
 
 But though these things are known in the free 
 States, and other things, if possible, worse, yet there is 
 a terrible deadness of moral sense. They are known 
 by clergymen who yet would not on any account so far 
 commit themselves as to preach on the evils of slavery, 
 or pray for the slaves in their pulpits. They are 
 known by politicians who yet give their votes for slav 
 ery extension and perpetuation. 
 
 This year both our great leading parties voted to 
 suppress all agitation of the subject, and in both those 
 parties were men who knew personally facts of slavery 
 and the internal slave-trade that one would think no 
 man could ever forget. Men united in pledging them 
 selves to the Fugitive Slave Law, who yet would tell 
 you in private conversation that it was an abomination, 
 and who do not hesitate to say, that as a matter of 
 practice they always help the fugitive because they 
 can t do otherwise. 
 
 The moral effect of this constant insincerity, the 
 moral effect of witnessing and becoming accustomed to 
 the most appalling forms of crime and oppression, is to 
 me the most awful and distressing part of the subject. 
 Nothing makes me feel it so painfully as to see with 
 how much more keenness the English feel the disclos 
 ures of my book than the Americans. I myself am 
 blunted by use by seeing, touching, handling the 
 

<page 200>
AN APPEAL TO FACTS. 167 
 
 details. In dealing even for the ransom of slaves, in 
 learning market prices of men, women, and children, I 
 feel that I acquire a horrible familiarity with evil. 
 
 Here, then, the great, wise, and powerful mind of 
 England, if she will but fully master the subject, may 
 greatly help us. Hers is the same kind of mind as 
 our own, but disembarrassed from our temptations and 
 unnerved by the thousands of influences that blind and 
 deaden us. There is a healthful vivacity of moral feel 
 ing on this subject that must electrify our paralyzed 
 vitality. For this reason, therefore, I rejoice when I 
 see minds like your lordship s turning to this subject ; 
 and I feel an intensity of emotion, as if I could say, Do 
 not for Christ s sake let go ; you know not what you 
 may do. 
 
 Your lordship will permit me to send you two of the 
 most characteristic documents of the present struggle, 
 written by two men who are, in their way, as eloquent 
 for the slave as Chatham was for us in our hour of 
 need. 
 
 I am now preparing some additional notes to my 
 book, in which I shall further confirm what I have 
 said by facts and statistics, and in particular by ex 
 tracts from the codes of slaveholding States, and the 
 records of their courts. These are documents that 
 cannot be disputed, and I pray your lordship to give 
 them your attention. No disconnected facts can be so 
 terrible as these legal decisions. They will soon appear 
 in England. 
 
 It is so far from being irrelevant for England to 
 notice slavery that I already see indications that this 
 subject, on both sides, is yet to be presented there, and 
 

<page 201>

 the battle fought on English ground. I see that my 
 friend the South Carolinian gentleman has sent to 
 &quot; Eraser s Magazine &quot; an article; before published in 
 this country, on &quot; Uncle Tom s Cabin.&quot; The article in 
 the London &quot;Times&quot; was eagerly reprinted in this 
 country, was issued as a tract and sold by the hundred, 
 headed, &quot; What they think of &amp;lt; Uncle Tom in Eng 
 land.&quot; If I mistake not, a strong effort will be made 
 to pervert the public mind of England, and to do away 
 the impression which the book has left. 
 
 For a time after it was issued it seemed to go by 
 acclamation. From quarters the mOst unexpected, from 
 all political parties, came an almost unbroken chorus of 
 approbation. I was very much surprised, knowing the 
 explosive nature of the subject. It was not till the 
 sale had run to over a hundred thousand copies that 
 reaction began, and the reaction was led off by the 
 London &quot; Times.&quot; Instantly, as by a preconcerted sig 
 nal, all papers of a certain class began to abuse ; and 
 some who had at first issued articles entirely commen 
 datory, now issued others equally depreciatory. Reli 
 gious papers, notably the &quot; New York Observer,&quot; came 
 out and denounced the book as anti-Christian, anti- 
 evangelical, resorting even to personal slander on the 
 author as a means of diverting attention from the work. 
 
 All this has a meaning, but I think it comes too 
 late. I can think of no reason why it was not tried 
 sooner, excepting that God had intended that the cause 
 should have a hearing. It is strange that they should 
 have waited so long for the political effect of a book 
 which they might have foreseen at first ; but not 
 strange that they should, now they do see what it is 
 doing, attempt to root it up. 
 

<page 202>
AN APPEAL TO FACTS. 169 
 
 The effects of the book so far have been, I think, 
 these : 1st. To soften and moderate the bitterness of 
 feeling in extreme abolitionists. 2d. To convert to 
 abolitionist views many whom this same bitterness had 
 repelled. 3d. To inspire the free colored people with 
 self-respect, hope, and confidence. 4th. To inspire 
 universally through the country a kindlier feeling to 
 ward the negro race. 
 
 It was unfortunate for the cause of freedom that the 
 first agitators of this subject were of that class which 
 your lordship describes in your note as &quot; well-meaning 
 men.&quot; I speak sadly of their faults, for they were 
 men of noble hearts. &quot; But oppression maketh a wise 
 man mad&quot; and they spoke and did many things in the 
 frenzy of outraged humanity that repelled sympathy 
 and threw multitudes off to a hopeless distance. It is 
 mournful to think of all the absurdities that have been 
 said and done in the name and for the sake of this 
 holy cause, that have so long and so fatally retarded it. 
 
 I confess that I expected for myself nothing but 
 abuse from extreme abolitionists, especially as I dared 
 to name a forbidden shibboleth, &quot; Liberia,&quot; and the 
 fact that the wildest and extremest abolitionists united 
 with the coldest conservatives, at first, to welcome and 
 advance the book is a thing that I have never ceased 
 to wonder at. 
 
 I have written this long letter because I am ex 
 tremely desirous that some leading minds in England 
 should know how we stand. The subject is now on 
 trial at the bar of a civilized world a Christian 
 world ! and I feel sure that God has not ordered this 
 without a design. Yours for the cause, 
 
 HARRIET BEECHER STOWE.

170 UNCLE TOM S CABIN. 
 
 In December the Earl of Shaftesbury wrote to Mrs. 
 Stowe : 
 
 MADAM, It is very possible that the writer of this 
 letter may be wholly unknown to you. But whether 
 my name be familiar to your ears, or whether you now 
 read it for the first time, I cannot refrain from express 
 ing to you the deep gratitude that I feel to Almighty 
 God who has inspired both your heart and your head 
 in the composition of &quot; Uncle Tom s Cabin.&quot; None 
 but a Christian believer could have produced such a 
 book as yours, which has absolutely startled the whole 
 world, and impressed many thousands by revelations of 
 cruelty and sin that give us an idea of what would be 
 the uncontrolled dominion of Satan on this fallen earth. 
 
 To this letter Mrs. Stowe replied as follows : 
 
 ANDOVER, January 6, 1853. 
 
 To THE EARL OF SHAFTESBURY : 
 
 My Lord, The few lines I have received from you 
 are a comfort and an encouragement to me, feeble as 
 I now am in health, and pressed oftentimes with sor 
 rowful thoughts. 
 
 It is a comfort to know that in other lands there 
 are those who feel as we feel, and who are looking with 
 simplicity to the gospel of Jesus, and prayerfully hop 
 ing his final coming. 
 
 My lord, before you wrote me I read with deep 
 emotion your letter to the ladies of England, and sub 
 sequently the noble address of the Duchess of Suther 
 land, and I could not but feel that such movements, 
 

<page 204>
MRS. STOWE S REPLY. 171 
 
 
 
 originating in such a quarter, prompted by a spirit so 
 devout and benevolent, were truly of God, and must 
 result in a blessing to the world. 
 
 I grieve to see that both in England and this coun 
 try there are those who are entirely incapable of appre 
 ciating the Christian and truly friendly feeling that 
 prompted this movement, and that there are even those 
 who meet it with coarse personalities such as I had not 
 thought possible in an English or American paper. 
 
 When I wrote my work it was in simplicity and in 
 the love of Christ, and if I felt anything that seemed 
 to me like a call to undertake it, it was this, that I had 
 a true heart of love for the Southern people, a feeling 
 appreciation of their trials, and a sincere admiration of 
 their many excellent traits, and that I thus felt, I 
 think, must appear to every impartial reader of the 
 work. 
 
 It was my hope that a book so kindly intended, so 
 favorable in many respects, might be permitted free 
 circulation among them, and that the gentle voice of 
 Eva and the manly generosity of St. Clare might be 
 allowed to say those things of the system which would 
 be invidious in any other form. 
 
 At first the book seemed to go by acclamation ; the 
 South did not condemn, and the North was loud and 
 unanimous in praise ; not a dissenting voice was raised ; 
 to my astonishment everybody praised. But when the 
 book circulated so widely and began to penetrate the 
 Southern States, when it began to be perceived how 
 powerfully it affected every mind that read it, there 
 came on a reaction. 
 
 Answers, pamphlets, newspaper attacks came thick 
 

<page 205>
172 UNCLE TOM S CABIN. 
 
 
 
 and fast, and certain Northern papers, religious, so 
 called, turned and began to denounce the work as un 
 christian, heretical, etc. The reason of all this is that 
 it has been seen that the book has a direct tendency 
 to do what it was written for, to awaken conscience 
 in the slaveholding States and lead to emancipation. 
 
 Now there is nothing that Southern political leaders 
 and capitalists so dread as anti-slavery feeling among 
 themselves. All the force of lynch law is employed to 
 smother discussion and blind conscience on this ques 
 tion. The question is not allowed to be discussed, and 
 he who sells a book or publishes a tract makes himself 
 liable to fine and imprisonment. 
 
 My book is, therefore, as much under an interdict 
 in some parts of the South as the Bible is in Italy. It 
 is not allowed in the bookstores, and the greater part 
 of the people hear of it and me only through grossly 
 caricatured representations in the papers, with garbled 
 extracts from the book. 
 
 A cousin residing in Georgia this winter says that 
 the prejudice against my name is so strong that she 
 dares not have it appear on the outside of her letters, 
 and that very amiable and excellent people have asked 
 her if such as I could be received into reputable society 
 at the North. 
 
 Under these circumstances, it is a matter of partic 
 ular regret that the &quot; New York Observer,&quot; an old and 
 long-established religious paper in the United States, 
 extensively read at the South, should have come out 
 in such a bitter and unscrupulous style of attack as 
 even to induce some Southern papers, with a generosity 
 one often finds at the South, to protest against it. 
 

<page 206>
MRS. STOWE S REPLY. 173 
 
 That they should use their Christian character and 
 the sacred name of Christ still further to blind the 
 minds and strengthen the prejudices of their Southern 
 brethren is to me a matter of deepest sorrow. All 
 those things, of course, cannot touch me in my private 
 capacity, sheltered as I am by a happy home and very 
 warm friends. I only grieve for it as a dishonor to 
 Christ and a real injustice to many noble-minded peo 
 ple at the South, who, if they were allowed quietly and 
 dispassionately to hear and judge, might be led to the 
 best results. 
 
 But, my lord, all this only shows us how strong is 
 the interest we touch. All the wealth of America 
 may be said to be interested in it. And, if I may judge 
 from the furious and bitter tone of some English papers, 
 they also have some sensitive connection with the evil. 
 
 I trust that those noble and gentle ladies of Eng 
 land who have in so good a spirit expressed their views 
 of the question will not be discouraged by the strong 
 abuse that will follow. England is doing us good. We 
 need the vitality of a disinterested country to warm our 
 torpid and benumbed public sentiment. 
 
 Nay, the storm of feeling which the book raises in 
 Italy, Germany, and France is all good, though truly 
 t is painful for us Americans to bear. The fact is, we 
 have become used to this frightful evil, and we need 
 the public sentiment of the world to help us. 
 
 I am now writing a work to be called &quot; Key to Uncle 
 Tom s Cabin.&quot; It contains, in an undeniable form, the 
 facts which corroborate all that I have said. One third 
 of it is taken up with judicial records of trials and 
 decisions, and with statute law. It is a most fearful 
 

<page 207>
174 UNCLE TOM S CABIN. 
 
 story, my lord, I can truly say that I write with life- 
 blood, but as called of God. I give in my evidence, 
 and I hope that England may so fix the attention of the 
 world on the facts of which I am the unwilling pub 
 lisher, that the Southern States may be compelled to 
 notice what hitherto they have denied and ignored. If 
 they call the fiction dreadful, what will they say of the 
 fact, where I cannot deny, suppress, or color ? But it 
 is God s will that it must be told, and I am the unwill 
 ing agent. 
 
 This coming month of April, my husband and my 
 self expect to sail for England on the invitation of the 
 Anti-Slavery Society of the Ladies and Gentlemen of 
 Glasgow, to confer with friends there. 
 
 There are points where English people can do much 
 good ; there are also points where what they seek to do 
 may be made more efficient by a little communion witli 
 those who know the feelings and habits of our country 
 men : but I am persuaded that England can do much 
 for us. 
 
 My lord, they greatly mistake who see, in this move 
 ment of English Christians for the abolition of slavery, 
 signs of disunion between the nations. It is the purest 
 and best proof of friendship England has ever shown 
 us, and will, I am confident, be so received. I earnestly 
 trust that all who have begun to take in hand the cause 
 will be in nothing daunted, but persevere to the end ; 
 for though everything else be against us, Christ is cer 
 tainly on our side and He must at last prevail, and it 
 will be done, &quot; not by might, nor by power, but by His 
 Spirit.&quot; Yours in Christian sincerity, 
 
 H. B. STOWE. 
 

<page 208>
LETTER TO ARTHUR HELPS. 175 
 
 Mrs. Stowe also received a letter from Arthur Helps l 
 accompanying a review of her work written by himself 
 and published in &quot; Eraser s Magazine.&quot; In his letter 
 Mr. Helps took exception to the comparison instituted 
 in &quot; Uncle Tom s Cabin &quot; between the working-classes 
 of England and the slaves of America. In her answer 
 to this criticism and complaint Mrs. Stowe says : 
 
 MB. ARTHUR HELPS : 
 
 My dear Sir, I cannot but say I am greatly 
 obliged to you for the kind opinions expressed in your 
 letter. On one point, however, it appears that my book 
 has not faithfully represented to you the feelings of my 
 heart. I mean in relation to the English nation as a 
 nation. You will notice that the remarks on that sub 
 ject occur in the dramatic part of the book, in the 
 mouth of an intelligent Southerner. As a fair-minded 
 
 o 
 
 person, bound to state for both sides all that could be 
 said in the person of St. Clare, the best that could be 
 said on that point, and what I know is in fact con 
 stantly reiterated, namely, that the laboring class of 
 the South are in many respects, as to physical comfort, 
 in a better condition than the poor of England. 
 
 This is the slaveholder s stereotyped apology, a 
 defense it cannot be, unless two wrongs make one right. 
 
 It is generally supposed among us that this estimate 
 of the relative condition of the slaves and the poor of 
 England is correct, and we base our ideas on reports 
 made in Parliament and various documentary evidence ; 
 also such sketches as &quot; London Labor and London Poor,&quot; 
 which have been widely circulated among us. The in-

 ference, however, which we of the freedom party draw 
 from it, is not that the slave is, on the whole, in the 
 best condition because of this striking difference ; that 
 in America the slave has not a recognized human char 
 acter in law, has not even an existence, whereas in Eng 
 land the law recognizes and protects the meanest sub 
 ject, in theory always, and in fact to a certain extent. 
 A prince of the blood could not strike the meanest 
 laborer without a liability to prosecution, in theory at 
 least, and that is something. In America any man 
 may strike any slave he meets, and if the master does 
 not choose to notice it, he has no redress. 
 
 I do not suppose human nature to be widely different 
 in England and America. In both countries, when any 
 class holds power and wealth by institutions which in 
 the long run bring misery on lower classes, they are 
 very unwilling still to part with that wealth and power. 
 They are unwilling to be convinced that it is their duty, 
 and unwilling to do it if they are. It is always so 
 everywhere ; it is not English nature or American nature, 
 but human nature. We have seen in England the bat 
 tle for popular rights fought step by step with as de 
 termined a resistance from parties in possession as the 
 slaveholder offers in America. 
 
 There was the same kind of resistance in certain quar 
 ters there to the laws restricting the employing of young 
 children eighteen hours a day in factories, as there is 
 here to the anti-slavery effort. 
 
 Again, in England as in America, there are, in those 
 very classes whose interests are most invaded by what 
 are called popular rights, some of the most determined 
 supporters of them, and here I think that the balance 
 

<page 210>
ENGLAND AND AMERICA. 177 
 
 preponderates in favor of England. I think there are 
 more of the high nobility of England who are friends 
 of the common people and willing to help the cause of 
 human progress, irrespective of its influence on their own 
 interests, than there are those of a similar class among 
 slaveholding aristocracy, though even that class is not 
 without such men. But I am far from having any of 
 that senseless prejudice against the English nation as a 
 nation which, greatly to my regret, I observe sometimes 
 in America. It is a relic of barbarism for two such 
 nations as England and America to cherish any such 
 unworthy prejudice. 
 
 For my own part, I am proud to be of English blood ; 
 and though I do not think England s national course 
 faultless, and though I think many of her institutions 
 and arrangements capable of much revision and im 
 provement, yet my heart warms to her as, on the whole, 
 the strongest, greatest, and best nation on earth. Have 
 not England and America one blood, one language, 
 one literature, and a glorious literature it is ! Are not 
 Milton and Shakespeare, and all the wise and brave 
 and good of old, common to us both, and should there 
 be anything but cordiality between countries that have 
 so glorious an inheritance in common ? If there is, it 
 will be elsewhere than in hearts like mine. 
 Sincerely yours,

 PREPARING TO VISIT SCOTLAND. LETTER TO MRS. FOLLEN. 
 
 VERY soon after the publication of &quot; Uncle Tom s 
 Cabin &quot; Mrs. Stowe visited her brother Henry in Brook 
 lyn, and while there became intensely interested in the 
 case of the Edmondsons, a slave family of Washington, 
 D. C. Emily and Mary two of the daughters of Paul 
 (a free colored man) and Milly (a slave) Edmondson, 
 had, for trying to escape from bondage, been sold to a 
 trader for the New Orleans market. While they were 
 lying in jail in Alexandria awaiting the making up of 
 a gang for the South, their heartbroken father deter 
 mined to visit the North and try to beg from a free 
 dom-loving people the money with which to purchase 
 his daughters liberty. The sum asked by the trader 
 was $2,250, but its magnitude did not appall the brave 
 old man, and he set forth upon his quest full of faith 
 that in some way he would secure it. 
 
 Reaching New York, he went to the anti-slavery 
 bureau and related his pitiful story. The sum de 
 manded was such a large one and seemed so exorbi- 
 

<page 212>
PAUL EDMONSON. 179 
 
 tant that even those who took the greatest interest in 
 the case were disheartened over the propect of raising 
 it. The old man was finally advised to go to Henry 
 Ward Beecher and ask his aid. He made his way to 
 the door of the great Brooklyn preacher s house, but, 
 overcome by many disappointments and fearing to meet 
 with another rebuff, hesitated to ring the bell, and sat 
 down on the steps with tears streaming from his eyes. 
 
 There Mr. Beecher found him, learned his story, and 
 promised to do what he could. There was a great 
 meeting in Plymouth Church that evening, and, taking 
 the old colored man with him to it, Mrs. Stowe s 
 brother made such an eloquent and touching appeal on 
 behalf of the slave girls as to rouse his audience to 
 profound indignation and pity. The entire sum of 
 $2,250 was raised then and there, and the old man, 
 hardly able to realize his great joy, was sent back to his 
 despairing children with their freedom money in his 
 hand. 
 
 All this had happened in the latter part of 1848, and 
 Mrs. Stowe had first known of the liberated girls in 
 1851, when she had been appealed to for aid in edu 
 cating them. From that time forward she became per 
 sonally responsible for all their expenses while they 
 remained in school, and until the death of one of them 
 in 1853. 
 
 Now during her visit to New York in the spring of 
 1852 she met their old mother, Milly Edmondson, who 
 had come North in the hope of saving her two remain 
 ing slave children, a girl and a young man, from falling 
 into the trader s clutches. Twelve hundred dollars was 
 the sum to be raised, and by hard work the father had 
 

<page 213>

 laid by one hundred of it when a severe illness put an 
 end to his efforts. After many prayers and much con 
 sideration of the matter, his feeble old wife said to him 
 one day, &quot; Paul, I m a gwine up to New York myself 
 to see if I can t get that money.&quot; 
 
 Her husband objected that she was too feeble, that 
 she would be unable to find her way, and that North 
 ern people had got tired of buying slaves to set them 
 free, but the resolute old woman clung to her purpose 
 and finally set forth. Reaching New York she made 
 her way to Mr. Beecher s house, where she was so fortu 
 nate as to find Mrs. Stowe. Now her troubles were at 
 an end, for this champion of the oppressed at once 
 made the slave woman s cause her own and promised 
 that her children should be redeemed. She at once set 
 herself to the task of raising the purchase-money, not 
 only for Milly s children, but for giving freedom to the 
 old slave woman herself. On May 29, she writes to her 
 husband in Brunswick : 
 
 &quot; The mother of the Edmondson girls, now aged and 
 feeble, is in the city. I did not actually know when I 
 wrote Uncle Tom of a living example in which Chris 
 tianity had reached its fullest development under the 
 crushing wrongs of slavery, but in this woman I see it. 
 I never knew before what I could feel till, with her sor 
 rowful, patient eyes upon me, she told me her history 
 and begged my aid. The expression of her face as she 
 spoke, and the depth of patient sorrow in her eyes, was 
 beyond anything I ever saw. 
 
 &quot; ( Well/ said I, when she had finished, * set your 
 heart at rest ; you and your children shall be redeemed. 
 If I can t raise the money otherwise, I will pay it my-

 self. You should have seen the wonderfully sweet, 
 solemn look she gave me as she said, The Lord bless 
 you, my child ! 
 
 &quot; Well, I have received a sweet note from Jenny 
 Lind, with her name and her husband s with which to 
 head my subscription list. They give a hundred dol 
 lars. Another hundred is subscribed by Mr. Bowen in 
 his wife s name, and I have put my own name down for 
 an equal amount. A lady has given me twenty-five 
 dollars, and Mr. Storrs has pledged me fifty dollars. 
 Milly and I are to meet the ladies of Henry s and Dr. 
 Cox s churches to-morrow, and she is to tell them her 
 story. I have written to Drs. Bacon and Button in 
 New Haven to secure a similar meeting of ladies there. 
 I mean to have one in Boston, and another in Port 
 land. It will do good to the givers as well as to the 
 receivers. 
 
 &quot; But all this time I have been so longing to get 
 your letter from New Haven, for I heard it was there. 
 It is not fame nor praise that contents me. I seem 
 never to have needed love so much as now. I long to 
 hear you say how much you love me. Dear one, if this 
 effort impedes my journey home, and wastes some of 
 my strength, you will not murmur. When I see this 
 Christlike soul standing so patiently bleeding, yet for 
 giving, I feel a sacred call to be the helper of the help 
 less, and it is better that my own family do without me 
 for a while longer than that this mother lose all. / 
 must redeem her. 
 
 &quot; New Haven, June 2. My old woman s case pro 
 gresses gloriously. I am to see the ladies of this place 
 to-morrow. Four hundred dollars were contributed by 
 

<page 215>
182 FIRST TRIP TO EUROPE. 
 
 individuals in Brooklyn, and the ladies who took sub 
 scription papers at the meeting will undoubtedly raise 
 two hundred dollars more.&quot; 
 
 Before leaving New York, Mrs. Stowe gave Milly 
 Edmondson her check for the entire sum necessary to 
 purchase her own freedom and that of her children, 
 and sent her home rejoicing. That this sum was made 
 up to her by the generous contributions of those to 
 whom she appealed is shown by a note written to her 
 husband and dated July, 1852, in which she says : 
 
 &quot; Had a very kind note from A. Lawrence inclosing 
 a twenty-dollar gold-piece for the Edmondsons. Isa 
 bella s ladies gave me twenty-five dollars, so you see 
 our check is more than paid already.&quot; 
 
 Although during her visit in New York Mrs. Stowe 
 made many new friends, and was overwhelmed with 
 congratulations and praise of her book, the most pleas 
 ing incident of this time seems to have been an episto- 
 latory interview with Jenny Lind (Goldschmidt). In 
 writing of it to her husband she says : 
 
 &quot; Well, we have heard Jenny Lind, and the affair 
 was a bewildering dream of sweetness and beauty. 
 Her face and movements are full of poetry and feeling. 
 She has the artless grace of a little child, the poetic 
 effect of a wood-nymph, is airy, light, and graceful. 
 
 &quot; We had first-rate seats, and how do you think we 
 got them ? When Mr. Howard went early in the 
 morning for tickets, Mr. Goldschmidt told him it was 
 impossible to get any good ones, as they were all sold. 
 Mr. Howard said he regretted that, on Mrs. Stowe s ac 
 count, as she was very desirous of hearing Jenny Lind. 
 Mrs. Stowe ! exclaimed Mr. Goldschmidt, the author 
 

<page 216>
MRS. GOLDSCHMIDTS NOTE. 183 
 
 of &quot; Uncle Tom s Cabin &quot; ? Indeed, she shall have a 
 seat whatever happens ! 
 
 &quot; Thereupon he took his hat and went out, returning 
 shortly with tickets for two of the best seats in the 
 house, inclosed in an envelope directed to me in his 
 wife s handwriting. Mr. Howard said he could have 
 sold those tickets at any time during the day for ten 
 dollars each. 
 
 &quot; To-day I sent a note of acknowledgment with a 
 copy of my book. I am most happy to have seen her, 
 for she is a noble creature.&quot; 
 
 To this note the great singer wrote in answer : 
 
 MY DEAR MADAM, Allow me to express my sin 
 cere thanks for your very kind letter, which I was very 
 happy to receive. 
 
 You must feel and know what a deep impression 
 &quot; Uncle Tom s Cabin &quot; has made upon every heart that 
 can feel for the dignity of human existence : so I with 
 my miserable English would not even try to say a word 
 about the great excellency of that most beautiful book, 
 but I must thank you for the great joy I have felt over 
 that book. 
 
 Forgive me, my dear madam : it is a great liberty I 
 take in thus addressing you, I know, but I have so 
 wished to find an opportunity to pour out my thank 
 fulness in a few words to you that I cannot help this 
 intruding. I have the feeling about &quot; Uncle Tom s 
 Cabin &quot; that great changes will take place by and by, 
 from the impression people receive out of it, and that 
 the writer of that book can fall asleep to-day or to 
 morrow with the bright, sweet conscience of having

 been a strong means in the Creator s hand of operating 
 essential good in one of the most important questions 
 for the welfare of our black brethren. God bless and 
 protect you and yours, dear madam, and certainly God s 
 hand will remain with a blessing over your head. 
 
 Once more forgive my bad English and the liberty 
 I have taken, and believe me to be, dear madam, 
 Yours most truly, 
 
 JENNY GOLDSCHMIDT, nee LLNTD. 
 
 In answer to Mrs. Stowe s appeal on behalf of the 
 Edmonsons, Jenny Lind wrote : 
 
 MY DEAR MRS. STOWE, I have with great interest 
 read your statement of the black family at Washing 
 ton. It is with pleasure also that I and my husband 
 are placing our humble names on the list you sent. 
 
 The time is short. I am very, very sorry that I shall 
 not be able to see you. I must say farewell to you in 
 this way. Hoping that in the length of time you may 
 live to witness the progression of the good sake for 
 which you so nobly have fought, my best wishes go 
 with you. Yours in friendship, 
 
 JENNY GOLDSCHMIDT. 
 
 While Mrs. Stowe was thus absent from home, her 
 husband received and accepted a most urgent call to 
 the Professorship of Sacred Literature in the Theolog 
 ical Seminary at Andover, Mass. 
 
 In regard to leaving Brunswick and her many 
 friends there, Mrs. Stowe wrote : &quot; For my part, if I 
 must leave Brunswick, I would rather leave at once. I 
 

<page 218>
&quot;THE CABIN.&quot; 185 
 
 can tear away with a sudden pull more easily than to 
 linger there knowing that I am to leave at last. I 
 shall never find people whom I shall like better than 
 those of Brunswick.&quot; 
 
 As Professor Stowe s engagements necessitated his 
 spending much of the summer in Brunswick, and also 
 making a journey to Cincinnati, it devolved upon his 
 wife to remain in Andover, and superintend the prepa 
 ration of the house they were to occupy. This was 
 known as the old stone workshop, on the west side of 
 the Common, and it had a year or two before been 
 fitted up by Charles Munroe and Jonathan Edwards 1 
 as the Seminary gymnasium. Beneath Mrs. Stowe s 
 watchful care and by the judicious expenditure of 
 money, it was transformed by the first of November 
 into the charming abode which under the name of 
 
 o 
 
 &quot; The Cabin &quot; became noted as one of the pleasantest 
 literary centres of the country. Here for many years 
 were received, and entertained in a modest way, many 
 of the most distinguished people of this and other 
 lands, and here were planned innumerable philanthropic 
 undertakings in which Mrs. Stowe and her scholarly 
 husband were the prime movers. 
 
 The summer spent in preparing this home was one 
 of great pleasure as well as literary activity. In July 
 Mrs. Stowe writes to her husband : &quot; I had no idea this 
 place was so beautiful. Our family circle is charming. 
 All the young men are so gentlemanly and so agree 
 able, as well as Christian in spirit. Mr. Dexter, his 
 wife, and sister are delightful. Last evening a party 
 of us went to ride on horseback down to Pomp s Pond.

 What a beautiful place it is ! There is everything here 
 that there is at Brunswick except the sea, a great ex 
 ception. Yesterday I was out all the forenoon sketch 
 ing elms. There is no end to the beauty of these trees. 
 I shall fill my book with them before I get through. 
 We had a levee at Professor Park s last week, quite a 
 brilliant affair. To-day there is to be a fishing party 
 to go to Salem beach and have a chowder. 
 
 &quot; It seems almost too good to be true that we are 
 going to have such a house in such a beautiful place, 
 and to live here among all these agreeable people, 
 where everybody seems to love you so much and to 
 think so much of you. I am almost afraid to accept it, 
 and should not, did I not see the Hand that gives it all 
 and know that it is both firm and true. He knows if 
 it is best for us, and His blessing addeth no sorrow 
 therewith. I cannot describe to you the constant un 
 dercurrent of love and joy and peace ever flowing 
 through my soul. I am so happy so blessed ! &quot; 
 
 The literary work of this summer was directed to 
 ward preparing articles on many subjects for the &quot; New 
 York Independent &quot; and the &quot; National Era,&quot; as well 
 as collecting material for future books. That the 
 &quot; Pearl of Orr s Island,&quot; which afterward appeared as a 
 serial in the &quot; Independent,&quot; was already contemplated, 
 is shown by a letter written July 29th, in which Mrs. 
 Stowe says : &quot; What a lovely place Andover is ! So 
 many beautiful walks ! Last evening a number of us 
 climbed Prospect Hill, and had a most charming walk. 
 Since I came here we have taken up hymn-singing to 
 quite an extent, and while we were all up on the hill 
 we sang &amp;lt; When I can read my title clear. It went 
 finely.

THE MAINE STORY. 187 
 
 &quot; I seem to have so much to fill my time, and yet 
 there is my Maine story waiting. However, I am com 
 posing it every day, only I greatly need living studies 
 for the filling in of my sketches. There is old Jonas, 
 my fish father, a sturdy, independent fisherman 
 farmer, who in his youth sailed all over the world and 
 made up his mind about everything. In his old age 
 he attends prayer-meetings and reads the Missionary 
 Herald. He also has plenty of money in an old brown 
 sea-chest. He is a great heart with an inflexible will 
 and iron muscles. I must go to Orr s Island and see 
 him again. I am now writing an article for the Era 
 on Maine and its scenery, which I think is even better 
 than the Independent letter. In it I took up Long 
 fellow. Next I shall write one on Hawthorne and his 
 surroundings. 
 
 &quot; To-day Mrs. Jewett sent out a most solemnly sav 
 age attack upon me from the Alabama Planter. 
 Among other things it says : ( The plan for assaulting 
 the best institutions in the world may be made just as 
 rational as it is by the wicked (perhaps unconsciously 
 so) authoress of this book. The woman who wrote it 
 must be either a very bad or a very fanatical person. 
 For her own domestic peace we trust no enemy will 
 ever penetrate into her household to pervert the scenes 
 he may find there with as little logic or kindness as she 
 has used in her &quot; Uncle Tom s Cabin.&quot; There s for 
 you ! Can you wonder now that such a wicked woman 
 should be gone from you a full month instead of the 
 week I intended ? Ah, welladay ! &quot; 
 
 At last the house was finished, the removal from 
 Brunswick effected, and the reunited famify was com-

 fortably settled in its Andover home. The plans for 
 the winter s literary work were, however, altered by 
 force of circumstances. Instead of proceeding quietly 
 and happily with her charming Maine story, Mrs. Stowe 
 found it necessary to take notice in some manner of 
 the cruel and incessant attacks made upon her as the 
 author of &quot; Uncle Tom s Cabin,&quot; and to fortify herself 
 against them by a published statement of incontroverti 
 ble facts. It was claimed on all sides that she had in 
 her famous book made such ignorant or malicious mis 
 representations that it was nothing short of a tissue of 
 falsehoods, and to refute this she was compelled to 
 write a &quot; Key to Uncle Tom s Cabin/ in which should 
 appear the sources from which she had obtained her 
 knowledge. Late in the winter Mrs. Stowe wrote : 
 
 &quot; I am now very much driven. I am preparing a 
 Key to unlock ( Uncle Tom s Cabin. It will contain 
 all the original facts, anecdotes, and documents on 
 which the story is founded, with some very interesting 
 and affecting stories parallel to those told of Uncle 
 Tom. Now I want you to write for me just what you 
 heard that slave-buyer say, exactly as he said it, that 
 people may compare it with what I have written. My 
 Key will be stronger than the Cabin.&quot; 
 
 In regard to this &quot; Key &quot; Mrs. Stowe also wrote to 
 the Duchess of Sutherland upon hearing that she had 
 headed an address from the women of England to those 
 of America : 
 
 /^ It is made up of the facts, the documents, the 
 things whic^i my own eyes have looked upon and my 
 hands have handled, that attest this awful indictment 
 

<page 224>
THE KEY. 189 
 
 upon my country. I write it in the anguish of my 
 soul, with tears and prayer, with sleepless nights and 
 weary days. I bear my testimony with a heavy heart, 
 as one who in court is forced by an awful oath to dis 
 close the sins of those dearest.^X 
 
 So I am called to draw up this fearful witness 
 against my country and send it into all countries, that 
 the general voice of humanity may quicken our para 
 lyzed vitality, that all Christians may pray for us, and 
 that shame, honor, love of country, and love of Christ 
 may be roused to give us strength to cast out this 
 mighty evil. Yours for the oppressed, 
 
 H. B. STOWE. 
 
 This harassing, brain-wearying, and heart-sickening 
 labor was continued until the first of April, 1853, when, 
 upon invitation of the Anti-Slavery Society of Glasgow, 
 Scotland, Mrs. Stowe, accompanied by her husband and 
 her brother, Charles Beecher, sailed for Europe. 
 
 In the mean time the success of &quot;Uncle Tom s Cabin &quot; 
 abroad was already phenomenal and unprecedented. 
 From the pen of Mr. Sampson Low, the well-known 
 London publisher, we have the following interesting 
 statement regarding it : 
 
 &quot; The first edition printed in London was in April, 
 1852, by Henry Vizetelly, in a neat volume at ten and 
 sixpence, of which he issued 7,000 copies. He received 
 the first copy imported, through a friend who had 
 bought it in Boston the day the steamer sailed, for his 
 own reading. He gave it to Mr. V., who took it to 
 the late Mr. David Bogue, well known for his general 
 shrewdness and enterprise. He had the book to read 
 

<page 225>
190 FIRST TRIP TO EUROPE. 
 
 and consider over night, and in the morning returned 
 it, declining to take it at the very moderate price of 
 five pounds. 
 
 &quot; Vizetelly at once put the volume into the hands of a 
 friendly printer and brought it out on his own account, 
 through the nominal agency of Clarke & Co. The 
 7,000 copies sold, other editions followed, and Mr. 
 Vizetelly disposed of his interest in the book to the 
 printer and agent, who joined with Mr. Beeton and at 
 once began to issue monster editions. The demand 
 called for fresh supplies, and these created an increased 
 demand. The discovery was soon made that any one 
 was at liberty to reprint the book, and the initiative 
 was thus given to a new era in cheap literature, founded 
 on American reprints. A shilling edition followed the 
 one-and-sixpence, and this in turn became the precursor 
 of one complete for sixpence. From April to De 
 cember, 1852, twelve different editions (not reissues) 
 were published, and within the twelve months of its 
 first appearance eighteen different London publishing 
 houses were engaged in supplying the great demand 
 that had set in, the total number of editions being 
 forty, varying from fine art-illustrated editions at 15s., 
 10s., and 7s. 6d., to the cheap popular editions of Is., 
 9d., and 6d. 
 
 &quot; After carefully analyzing these editions and weigh 
 ing probabilities with ascertained facts, I am able pretty 
 confidently to say that the aggregate number of copies 
 circulated in Great Britain and the colonies exceeds 
 one and a half millions.&quot; 
 
 A similar statement made by Clarke & Co. in October, 
 1852, reveals the following facts. It says : &quot; An early 
 

<page 226>
UNCLE TOM IN ENGLAND. 191 
 
 copy was sent from America the latter end of April to 
 Mr. Bogue, the publisher, and was offered by him to 
 Mr. Gilpin, late of Bishopsgate Street. Being declined 
 by Mr. Gilpin, Mr. Bogue offered it to Mr. Henry 
 Vize telly, and by the latter gentleman it was eventually 
 purchased for us. Before printing it, however, as 
 there was one night allowed for decision, one volume 
 was taken home to be read by Mr. Vizetelly, and the 
 other by Mr. Salisbury, the printer, of Bouverie Street. 
 The report of the latter gentleman the following morn 
 ing, to quote his own words, was : I sat up till four 
 in the morning reading the book, and the interest I felt 
 was expressed one moment by laughter, another by tears. 
 Thinking it might be weakness and not the power of 
 the author that affected me, I resolved to try the effect 
 upon my wife (a rather strong-minded woman). I 
 accordingly woke her and read a few chapters to her. 
 Finding that the interest in the story kept her awake, 
 and that she, too, laughed and cried, I settled in my 
 mind that it was a book that ought to, and might with 
 safety, be printed. 
 
 &quot; Mr. Vizetelly s opinion coincided with that of Mr. 
 Salisbury, and to the latter gentleman it was confided 
 to be brought out immediately. The week following 
 the book was produced and one edition of 7,000 copies 
 worked off. It made no stir until the middle of June, 
 although we advertised it very extensively. From 
 June it began to make its way, and it sold at the rate of 
 1,000 per week during July. In August the demand 
 became very great, and went on increasing to the 20th, 
 by which time it was perfectly overwhelming. We 
 have now about 400 people employed in getting out 
 

<page 227>
192 FIRST TRIP TO EUROPE. 
 
 the book, and seventeen printing machines besides hand 
 presses. Already about 150,000 copies of the book 
 are in the hands of the people, and still the returns of 
 sales show no decline.&quot; 
 
 The story was dramatized in the United States in 
 August, 1852, without the consent or knowledge of 
 the author, who had neglected to reserve her rights for 
 this purpose. In September of the same year we find 
 it announced as the attraction at two London theatres, 
 namely, the Royal Victoria and the Great National 
 Standard. In 1853 Professor Stowe writes : &quot; The 
 drama of Uncle Tom has been going on in the Na 
 tional Theatre of New York all summer with most un 
 paralleled success. Everybody goes night after night, 
 and nothing can stop it. The enthusiasm beats that 
 of the run in the Boston Museum out and out. The 
 &amp;lt; Tribune is full of it. The &amp;lt; Observer/ the &amp;lt; Journal 
 of Commerce, and all that sort of fellows, are aston 
 ished and nonplussed. They do not know what to say 
 or do about it.&quot; 
 
 While the English editions of the story were rapidly 
 multiplying, and being issued with illustrations by 
 Cruikshank, introductions by Elihu Burritt, Lord Car 
 lisle, etc., it was also making its way over the Continent. 
 For the authorized French edition, translated by Ma 
 dame Belloc, and published by Charpentier of Paris, 
 Mrs. Stowe wrote the following : 
 
 PREFACE TO THE EUROPEAN EDITION. 
 
 In authorizing the circulation of this work on the 
 Continent of Europe, the author has only this apology, 
 that the love of man is higher than the love of country. 
 

<page 228>
PREFACE TO EUROPEAN EDITION. 193 
 
 The great mystery which all Christian nations hold 
 in common, the union of God with man through the 
 humanity of Jesus Christ, invests human existence with 
 an awful sacredness ; and in the eye of the true believer 
 in Jesus, he who tramples on the rights of his meanest 
 fellow-man is not only inhuman but sacrilegious, and 
 the worst form of this sacrilege is the institution of # 
 slavery. 
 
 It hajsjjgenjsaid that the representations of this book 
 are exaggerations ! and oh, would that this were true ! 
 Would that this book were indeed a fiction, and not a 
 close mosaic of facts ! But that it is not a fiction the 
 proofs lie bleeding in thousands of hearts ; they have 
 been attested by surrounding voices from almost every 
 slave State, and from slave-owners themselves. Since so 
 it must be, thanks be to God that this mighty cry, this 
 wail of an unutterable anguish, has at last been heard ! 
 
 It has been said, and not in utter despair but in sol 
 emn hope and assurance may we regard the struggle 
 that now convulses America, the outcry of the demon 
 of slavery, which has heard the voice of Jesus of Naza 
 reth, and is rending and convulsing the noble nation 
 from which at last it must depart. 
 
 It cannot be that so monstrous a solecism can long 
 exist in the bosom of a nation which in all respects is 
 the best exponent of the great principle of universal 
 brotherhood. In America the Frenchman, the Ger 
 man, the Italian, the Swede, and the Irish all mingle on 
 terms of equal right ; all nations there display their 
 characteristic excellences and are admitted by her lib 
 eral laws to equal privileges : everything is tending to 
 liberalize, humanize, and elevate, and for that very rea- 
 

<page 229>

 194 FIRST TRIP TO EUROPE. 
 
 son it is that the contest with slavery there grows every 
 year more terrible. 
 
 The stream of human progress, widening, deepening, 
 strengthening from the confluent forces of all nations, 
 meets this barrier, behind which is concentrated all the 
 ignorance, cruelty, and oppression of the dark ages, and 
 it roars and foams and shakes the barrier, and anon it 
 must bear it down. 
 
 In its commencement slavery overspread every State 
 in the Union : the progress of society has now eman 
 cipated the North from its yoke. In Kentucky, Ten 
 nessee, Virginia, and Maryland, at different times, strong 
 movements have been made for emancipation, move 
 ments enforced by a comparison of the progressive 
 march of the adjoining free States with the poverty 
 and sterility and ignorance produced by a system which 
 in a few years wastes and exhausts all the resources of 
 soil without the power of renewal. 
 
 The time cannot be distant when these States will 
 emancipate for self-preservation ; and if no new slave 
 territory be added, the increase of slave population in 
 the remainder will enforce measures of emancipation. 
 
 Here, then, is the point of the battle. Unless more 
 slave territory is gained, slavery dies ; if it is gained, it 
 lives. Around this point political parties fight and 
 manoeuvre, and every year the battle wages hotter. 
 
 The internal struggles of no other nation in the 
 world are so interesting to Europeans as those of 
 America ; for America is fast filling up from Europe, 
 and every European has almost immediately his vote in 
 her councils. 
 
 If, therefore, the oppressed of other nations desire to 
 

<page 230>
TRANSLATIONS. 195 
 
 find in America an asylum of permanent freedom, let 
 them come prepared, heart and hand, and vote against 
 the institution of slavery ; for they who enslave man 
 cannot themselves remain free. 
 
 True are the great words of Kossuth : &quot; No nation 
 can remain free with whom freedom is & privilege and 
 not a principle.&quot; 
 
 This preface was more or less widely copied hi the 
 twenty translations of the book that quickly followed 
 its first appearance. These, arranged in the alphabetical 
 order of their languages, are as follows : Armenian, Bo 
 hemian, Danish, Dutch, Finnish, Flemish, French, Ger 
 man, Hungarian, Illyrian, Italian, Polish, Portuguese, 
 Romaic or modern Greek, Russian, Servian, Spanish, 
 Wallachian, and Welsh. 
 
 In Germany it received the following flattering notice 
 from one of the leading literary journals : &quot; The aboli 
 tionists in the United States should vote the author of 
 Uncle Tom s Cabin a civic crown, for a more pow 
 erful ally than Mrs. Harriet Beecher Stowe and her 
 romance they could not have. We confess that in the 
 whole modern romance literature of Germany, England, 
 and France, we know of no novel to be called equal to 
 this. In comparison with its glowing eloquence that 
 never fails of its purpose, its wonderful truth to nature, 
 the largeness of its ideas, and the artistic faultlessness 
 of the machinery in this book, George Sand, with her 
 Spiridion and Claudie, appears to us untrue and artificial ; 
 Dickens, with his but too faithful pictures from the 
 popular life of London, petty ; Bulwer, hectic and self- 
 conscious. It is like a sign of warning from the New 
 World to the Old.&quot; 
 

<page 231>
196 FIRST TRIP TO EUROPE. 
 
 Madatne George Sand reviewed the book, and spoke 
 of Mrs. Stowe herself in words at once appreciative and 
 discriminating : &quot; Mrs. Stowe is all instinct ; it is the 
 very reason she appears to some not to have talent. 
 Has she not talent ? What is talent ? Nothing, doubt 
 less, compared to genius ; but has she genius ? She 
 has genius as humanity feels the need of genius, 
 the genius of goodness, not that of the man of letters, 
 but that of the saint.&quot; 
 
 Charles Sumner wrote from the senate chamber at 
 Washington to Professor Stowe : &quot; All that I hear and 
 read bears testimony to the good Mrs. Stowe has done. 
 The article of George Sand is a most remarkable trib 
 ute, such as was hardly ever offered by such a genius to 
 any living mortal. Should Mrs. Stowe conclude to visit 
 Europe she will have a triumph.&quot; 
 
 From Eversley parsonage Charles Kingsley wrote to 
 Mrs. Stowe : 
 
 &quot; A thousand thanks for your delightful letter. As 
 for your progress and ovation here in England, I have 
 no fear for you. You will be flattered and worshiped. 
 You deserve it and you must bear it. I am sure that 
 you have seen and suffered too much and too long to 
 be injured by the foolish yet honest and heartfelt lion 
 izing which you must go through. 
 
 I have many a story to tell you when we meet about 
 the effects of the great book upon the most unexpected 
 people. 
 
 Yours ever faithfully, 
 
 C. KINGSLEY.

LETTER TO MRS. POLLEN. 197 
 
 March 28, 1853, Professor Stowe sent the following 
 communication to the Committee of Examination of the 
 Theological Seminary at Andover : &quot; As I shall not be 
 present at the examinations this term, I think it proper 
 to make to you a statement of the reasons of my ab 
 sence. During the last winter I have not enjoyed my 
 usual health. Mrs. Stowe also became sick and very 
 much exhausted. At this time we had the offer of a 
 voyage to Great Britain and back free of expense.&quot; 
 
 This offer, coming as it did from the friends of the 
 cause of emancipation in the United Kingdom, was 
 gladly accepted by Mr. and Mrs. Stowe, and they sailed 
 immediately. 
 
 The preceding month Mrs. Stowe had received a let 
 ter from Mrs. Follen in London, asking for information 
 with regard to herself, her family, and the circum 
 stances of her writing &quot; Uncle Tom s Cabin.&quot; 
 
 In reply Mrs. Stowe sent the following very charac 
 teristic letter, which may be safely given at the risk of 
 some repetition : 
 
 ANDOVER, February 16, 1853. 
 
 MY DEAR MADAM, I hasten to reply to your letter, 
 to me the more interesting that I have long been ac 
 quainted with you, and during all the nursery part of 
 my life made daily use of your poems for children. 
 
 I used to think sometimes in those days that I would 
 write to you, and tell you how much I was obliged to 
 you for the pleasure which they gave us all. 
 
 So you want to know something about what sort of 
 a woman I am ! Well, if this is any object, you shall 
 have statistics free of charge. To begin, then, I am a 
 little bit of a woman, somewhat more than forty,

 about as thin and dry as a pinch of snuff ; never very 
 much to look at in my best days, and looking like a 
 used-up article now. 
 
 I was married when I was twenty-five years old to a 
 man rich in Greek and Hebrew, Latin and Arabic, and, 
 alas ! rich in nothing else. When I went to house 
 keeping, my entire stock of china for parlor and kitchen 
 was bought for eleven dollars. That lasted very well 
 for two years, till my brother was married and brought 
 his bride to visit me. I then found, on review, that I 
 had neither plates nor teacups to set a table for my 
 father s family ; wherefore I thought it best to reinforce 
 the establishment by getting me a tea-set that cost ten 
 dollars more, and this, I believe, formed my whole stock 
 in trade for some years. 
 
 But then I was abundantly enriched with wealth of 
 another sort. 
 
 I had two little, curly-headed twin daughters to begin 
 with, and my stock in this line has gradually increased, 
 till I have been the mother of seven children, the most 
 beautiful and the most loved of whom lies buried near 
 my Cincinnati residence. It was at his dying bed and 
 / . - at his grave that I learned what a poor slave mother 
 may feel when her child is torn away from her. In 
 those depths of sorrow which seemed to me immeasur 
 able, it was my only prayer to God that such anguish 
 might not be suffered in vain. There were circum 
 stances about his death of such peculiar bitterness, of 
 what seemed almost cruel suffering, that I felt that I 
 could never be consoled for it, unless this crushing of 
 my own heart might enable me to work out some great 
 good to others. . . . 
 

<page 234>
HOW SHE BECAME AN AUTHOR, 199 
 
 I allude to this here because I have often felt that 
 much that is in that book (&quot; Uncle Tom &quot;) had its root 
 in the awful scenes and bitter sorrows of that summer. 
 It has left now, I trust, no trace on my mind, except a 
 deep compassion for the sorrowful, especially for moth 
 ers who are separated from their children. 
 
 During long years of struggling with poverty and 
 sickness, and a hot, debilitating climate, my children 
 grew up around me. The nursery and the kitchen were 
 my principal fields of labor. Some of my friends, pity 
 ing my trials, copied and sent a number of little sketches 
 from my pen to certain liberally paying &quot; Annuals &quot; 
 with my name. With the first money that I earned in 
 this way I bought a feather-bed ! for as I had married 
 into poverty and without a dowry, and as my husband 
 had only a large library of books and a great deal of 
 learning, the bed and pillows were thought the most 
 profitable investment. After this I thought that I had 
 discovered the philosopher s stone. So when a new car 
 pet or mattress was going to be needed, or when, at the 
 close of the year, it began to be evident that my family 
 accounts, like poor Dora s, &quot; would n t add up,&quot; then I 
 used to say to my faithful friend and factotum Anna, 
 who shared all my joys and sorrows, &quot; Now, if you will 
 keep the babies and attend to the things in the house 
 for one day, I 11 write a piece, and then we shall be out 
 of the scrape.&quot; So I became an author, very modest 
 at first, I do assure you, and remonstrating very seri 
 ously with the friends who had thought it best to put 
 my name to the pieces by way of getting up a reputa 
 tion ; and if you ever see a woodcut of me, with an 
 immoderately long nose, on the cover of all the U. S. 
 

<page 235>
200 FIRST TRIP TO EUROPE. 
 
 Almanacs, I wish you to take notice, that I have been 
 forced into it contrary to my natural modesty by the 
 imperative solicitations of my dear five thousand friends 
 and the public generally. One thing I must say with 
 regard to my life at the West, which you will under 
 stand better than many English women could. 
 
 I lived two miles from the city of Cincinnati, in the 
 country, and domestic service, not always you know to 
 be found in the city, is next to an impossibility to ob 
 tain in the country, even by those who are willing to 
 give the highest wages ; so what was to be expected for 
 poor me, who had very little of this world s goods to 
 offer? 
 
 Had it not been for my inseparable friend Anna, a 
 noble-hearted English girl, who landed on our shores 
 in destitution and sorrow, and clave to me as Euth to 
 Naomi, I had never lived through all the trials which 
 this uncertainty and want of domestic service imposed 
 on both : you may imagine, therefore, how glad I was 
 when, our seminary property being divided out into 
 small lots which were rented at a low price, a number 
 of poor families settled in our vicinity, from whom we 
 could occasionally obtain domestic service. About a 
 dozen families of liberated slaves were among the num 
 ber, and they became my favorite resort in cases of 
 emergency. If anybody wishes to have a black face 
 look handsome, let them be left, as I have been, in feeble 
 health in oppressive hot weather, with a sick baby in 
 arms, and two or three other little ones in the nursery, 
 and not a servant in the whole house to do a single turn. 
 Then, if they could see my good old Aunt Frankie com 
 ing with her honest, bluff, black face, her long, strong 
 

<page 236>
ELIZA BUCK. 201 
 
 arms, her chest as big and stout as a barrel, and her 
 hilarious, hearty laugh, perfectly delighted to take one s 
 washing and do it at a fair price, they would appreciate 
 the beauty of black people. 
 
 My cook, poor Eliza Buck, how she would stare to 
 think of her name going to England ! was a regular 
 epitome of slave life in herself ; fat, gentle, easy, lov 
 ing and lovable, always calling my very modest house 
 and door-yard &quot; The Place,&quot; as if it had been a planta 
 tion with seven hundred hands on it. She had lived 
 through the whole sad story of a Virginia-raised slave s 
 life. In her youth she must have been a very hand 
 some mulatto girl. Her voice was sweet, and her man 
 ners refined and agreeable. She was raised in a good 
 family as a nurse and seamstress. When the family 
 became embarrassed, she was suddenly sold on to a 
 plantation in Louisiana. She has often told me how, 
 without any warning, she was suddenly forced into a 
 carriage, and saw her little mistress screaming and 
 stretching her arms from the window towards her as 
 she was driven away. She has told me of scenes on 
 the Louisiana plantation, and she has often been out at 
 night by stealth ministering to poor slaves who had 
 been mangled and lacerated by the lash. Hence she 
 was sold into Kentucky, and her last master was the 
 father of all her children. On this point she ever 
 maintained a delicacy and reserve that always appeared 
 to me remarkable. She always called him her husband ; 
 and it was not till after she had lived with me some 
 years that I discovered the real nature of the connec 
 tion. I shall never forget how sorry I felt for her, nor 
 my feelings at her humble apology, &quot; You know, Mrs. 
 

<page 237>
202 FIRST TRIP TO EUROPE. 
 
 Stowe, slave women cannot help themselves.&quot; She had 
 two very pretty quadroon daughters, with her beautiful 
 hair and eyes, interesting children, whom I had in 
 structed in the family school with my children. Time 
 would fail to tell you aU that I learned incidentally of 
 the slave system in the history of various slaves who 
 came into my family, and of the underground railroad 
 which, I may say, ran through our house. But the 
 letter is already too long. 
 
 You ask with regard to the remuneration which I 
 have received for my work here in America. Having 
 been poor all my life and expecting to be poor the rest 
 of it, the idea of making money by a book which I 
 rote just because I could not help it, never occurred 
 jto me. It was therefore an agreeable surprise to re 
 ceive ten thousand dollars as the first-fruits of three 
 months sale. I presume as much more is now due. 
 Mr. Bosworth in England, the firm of Clarke & Co., 
 and Mr. Bentley, have all offered me an interest in the 
 sales of their editions in London. I am very glad of 
 it, both on account of the value of what they offer, 
 and the value of the example they set in this matter, 
 wherein I think that justice has been too little regarded. 
 
 I have been invited to visit Scotland, and shall proba 
 bly spend the summer there and in England. 
 
 I have very much at heart a design to erect in some 
 of the Northern States a normal school, for the educa 
 tion of colored teachers in the United States and in 
 Canada. I have very much wished that some perma 
 nent memorial of good to the colored race might be 
 created out of the proceeds of a work which promises 
 to have so unprecedented a sale. My own share of the 
 

<page 238>
WRITING WITH HEART S BLOOD. 203 
 
 profits will be less than that of the publisher s , either 
 English or American; but I am willing to give largely 
 for this purpose, and I have no doubt that the pub 
 lishers, both American and English, will unite with me ; 
 for nothing tends more immediately to the emancipa 
 tion of the slave than the education and elevation of 
 the free. 
 
 I am now writing a work which will contain, perhaps, 
 an equal amount of matter with &quot; Uncle Tom s Cabin.&quot; 
 It will contain all the facts and documents on which 
 that story was founded, and an immense body of facts, 
 reports of trials, legal documents, and testimony of 
 people now living South, which will more than confirm 
 every statement in &quot; Uncle Tom s Cabin.&quot; 
 
 I must confess that till I began the examination of 
 facts in order to write this book, much as I thought I 
 knew before, I had not begun to measure the depth of 
 the abyss. The law records of courts and judicial pro 
 ceedings are so incredible as to fill me with amazement 
 whenever I think of them. It seems to me that the 
 book cannot but be felt, and, coming upon the sensi 
 bility awaked by the other, do something. 
 
 I suffer exquisitely in writing these things. It may 
 be truly said that I write with my heart s blood. Many 
 times in writing &quot; Uncle Tom s Cabin &quot; I thought my 
 health would fail utterly ; but I prayed earnestly that 
 God would help me till I got through, and still I am 
 pressed beyond measure and above strength. 
 
 This horror, this nightmare abomination ! can it be 
 in my country ! It lies like lead on my heart, it 
 shadows my life with sorrow ; the more so that I feel, 
 as for my own brothers, for the South, and am pained 
 

<page 239>
204 FIRST TRIP TO EUROPE. 
 
 by every horror I am obliged to write, as one who is 
 forced by some awful oath to disclose in court some 
 family disgrace. Many times I have thought that I 
 must die, and yet I pray God that I may live to see 
 something done. I shall in all probability be in Lon 
 don in May : shall I see you ? 
 
 It seems to me so odd and dream-like that so many 
 persons desire to see me, and now I cannot help think 
 ing that they will think, when they do, that God hath 
 chosen &quot; the weak things of this world.&quot; 
 
 If I live till spring I shaU hope to see Shakespeare s 
 grave, and Milton s mulberry-tree, and the good land of 
 my fathers, old, old England ! May that day come ! 
 Yours affectionately, 
 
 H. B. STOWE.

 THE journey undertaken by Mrs. Stowe with her 
 husband and brother through England and Scotland, 
 and afterwards with her brother alone over much of 
 the Continent, was one of unusual interest. No one 
 was more surprised than Mrs. Stowe herself by the 
 demonstrations of respect and affection that everywere 
 greeted her. 
 
 Fortunately an unbroken record of this memorable 
 journey, in Mrs. Stowe s own words, has been preserved, 
 and we are thus able to receive her own impressions of 
 what she saw, heard, and did, under circumstances that 
 were at once pleasant, novel, and embarrassing. Be 
 ginning with her voyage, she writes as follows : 
 
 LIVERPOOL, April 11, 1853. 
 
 MY DEAR CHILDREN, You w r ish, first of all, to 
 hear of the voyage. Let me assure you, my dears, in 
 the very commencement of the matter, that going to 
 sea is not at all the thing that we have taken it to be. 
 
 Let me warn you, if you ever go to sea, to omit all 
 

<page 241>
206 SUNNY MEMORIES. 
 
 preparations for amusement on shipboard. Don t leave 
 so much as the unlocking of a trunk to be done after 
 sailing. In the few precious minutes when the ship 
 stands still, before she weighs her anchor, set your 
 house, that is to say your stateroom, as much in order 
 as if you were going to be hanged ; place everything 
 in the most convenient position to be seized without 
 trouble at a moment s notice ; for be sure that in half 
 an hour after sailing, an infinite desperation will seize 
 you, in which the grasshopper will be a burden. If 
 anything is in your trunk, it might almost as well be 
 in the sea, for any practical probability of your getting 
 to it. 
 
 Our voyage out was called &quot; a good run.&quot; It was 
 voted unanimously to be &quot; an extraordinary good pas 
 sage,&quot; &quot; a pleasant voyage ; &quot; yet the ship rocked the 
 whole time from side to side with a steady, dizzy, con 
 tinuous motion, like a great cradle. I had a new sym 
 pathy for babies, poor little things, who are rocked 
 hours at a time without so much as a &quot; by your leave &quot; 
 in the case. No wonder there are so many stupid peo 
 ple in the world ! 
 
 We arrived on Sunday morning : the custom-house 
 officers, very gentlemanly men, came on board ; our 
 luggage was all set out, and passed through a rapid 
 examination, which in many cases amounted only to 
 opening the trunk and shutting it, and all was over. 
 The whole ceremony did not occupy two hours. 
 
 We were inquiring of some friends for the most con 
 venient hotel, when we found the son of Mr. Cropper, 
 of Dingle Bank, waiting in the cabin to take us with 
 him to their hospitable abode. In a few moments after 
 

<page 242>
LANDING IN ENGLAND. 207 
 
 the baggage had been examined, we all bade adieu to 
 the old ship, and went on board the little steam tender 
 which carries passengers up to the city. 
 
 This Mersey River would be a very beautiful one, if 
 it were not so dingy and muddy. As we are sailing 
 up in the tender towards Liverpool, I deplore the cir 
 cumstance feelingly. 
 
 &quot; What does make this river so muddy ? &quot; 
 
 &quot; Oh, says a by-stander, &quot; don t you know that 
 
 &quot; The quality of mercy is not strained ? &quot; 
 
 I had an early opportunity of making acquaintance 
 with my English brethren ; for, much to my astonish 
 ment, I found quite a crowd on the wharf, and we 
 walked up to our carriage through a long lane of peo 
 ple, bowing, and looking very glad to see us. 
 
 When I came to get into the hack it was surrounded 
 by more faces than I could count. They stood very 
 quietly, and looked very kindly, though evidently very 
 much determined to look. Something prevented the 
 hack from moving on ; so the interview was prolonged 
 for some time. 
 
 Our carriage at last drove on, taking us through 
 Liverpool and a mile or two out, and at length wound 
 its way along the gravel paths of a beautiful little re 
 treat, on the banks of the Mersey, called the &quot; Dingle.&quot; 
 It opened to my eyes like a paradise, all wearied as I 
 was with the tossing of the sea. I have since become 
 familiar with these beautiful little spots, which are so 
 common in England ; but now all was entirely new to me. 
 
 After a short season allotted to changing our ship 
 garments and for rest, we found ourselves seated at the 
 

<page 243>
208 SUNNY MEMORIES. 
 
 dinner table. While dining, the sister-in-law of our 
 friends came in from the next door, to exchange a word 
 
 O 
 
 or two of welcome, and invite us to breakfast with 
 them the following morning. 
 
 The next morning we slept late and hurried to dress, 
 remembering our engagement to breakfast with the 
 brother of our host, whose cottage stands on the same 
 ground, within a few steps of our own. I had not the 
 slightest idea of what the English mean by a breakfast, 
 and therefore went in all innocence, supposing I should 
 see nobody but the family circle of my acquaintances. 
 Quite to my astonishment, I found a party of between 
 thirty and forty people ; ladies sitting with their 
 bonnets on, as in a morning call. It was impossible, 
 however, to feel more than a momentary embarrass 
 ment in the friendly warmth and cordiality of the circle 
 by whom we were surrounded. 
 
 In the evening I went into Liverpool to attend a 
 party of friends of the anti-slavery cause. When I 
 was going away, the lady of the house said that the 
 servants were anxious to see me ; so I came into the 
 dressing-room to give them an opportunity. 
 
 The next day was appointed to leave Liverpool. A 
 great number of friends accompanied us to the cars, 
 and a beautiful bouquet of flowers was sent with a very 
 affecting message from a sick gentleman, who, from the 
 retirement of his chamber, felt a desire to testify his 
 sympathy. We left Liverpool with hearts a little trem 
 ulous and excited by the vibration of an atmosphere of 
 universal sympathy and kindness, and found ourselves, 
 at length, shut from the warm adieu of our friends, in 
 a snug compartment of the railroad car. 
 

<page 244>
FIRST GLIMPSES OF SCOTLAND. 209 
 
 &quot; Dear me ! &quot; said Mr. S. ; &quot; six Yankees shut up in 
 a car together ! Not one Englishman to tell us any 
 thing about the country ! Just like the six old ladies 
 that made their living by taking tea at each other s 
 houses ! &quot; 
 
 What a bright lookout we kept for ruins and old 
 houses ! Mr. S., whose eyes are always in every place, 
 allowed none of us to slumber, but looking out, first on 
 his own side and then on ours, called our attention to 
 every visible thing. If he had been appointed on a 
 mission of inquiry, he could not have been more zealous 
 and faithful, and I began to think that our desire for 
 an English cicerone was quite superfluous. 
 
 Well, we are in Scotland at last, and now our pulse 
 rises as the sun declines in the west. We catch glimpses 
 of Sol way Frith and talk about Redgauntlet. The sun 
 went down and night drew on ; still we were in Scot 
 land. Scotch ballads, Scotch tunes, and Scotch litera 
 ture were in the ascendant. We sang &quot; Auld Lang 
 Syne,&quot; &quot; Scots wha hae,&quot; and &quot; Bonnie Doon,&quot; and 
 then, changing the key, sang &quot;Dundee,&quot; &quot;Elgin,&quot; and 
 &quot;Martyr.&quot; 
 
 &quot; Take care,&quot; said Mr. S. ; &quot; don t get too much ex 
 cited.&quot; 
 
 &quot; Ah,&quot; said I, &quot; this is a thing that comes only once 
 in a lifetime ; do let us have the comfort of it. We 
 shall never come into Scotland for the first time again.&quot; 
 
 While we were thus at the fusion point of enthu 
 siasm, the cars stopped at Lockerbie. All was dim and 
 dark outside, but we soon became conscious that there 
 was quite a number of people collected, peering into 
 the window ; and with a strange kind of thrill, I heard 
 

<page 245>
210 SUNNY MEMORIES. 
 
 my name inquired for in the Scottish accent. I went 
 to the window ; there were men, women, and children 
 gathered, and hand after hand was presented, with the 
 words, &quot; Ye re welcome to Scotland ! &quot; 
 
 Then they inquired for and shook hands with all 
 the party, having in some mysterious manner got the 
 knowledge of who they were, even down to little G., 
 whom they took to be my son. Was it not pleasant, 
 when I had a heart so warm for this old country ? I 
 shall never forget the thrill of those words, &quot; Ye re 
 welcome to Scotland,&quot; nor the &quot; Gude night.&quot; 
 
 After that we found similar welcomes in many suc 
 ceeding stopping - places ; and though I did wave a 
 towel out of the window, instead of a pocket handker 
 chief, and commit other awkwardnesses, from not know 
 ing how to play my part, yet I fancied, after all, that 
 Scotland and we were coming on well together. Who 
 the good souls were that were thus watching for us 
 through the night, I am sure I do not know ; but that 
 they were of the &quot;one blood&quot; which unites all the 
 families of the earth, I felt. 
 
 At Glasgow, friends were waiting in the station- 
 house. Earnest, eager, friendly faces, ever so many. 
 Warm greetings, kindly words. A crowd parting in 
 the middle, through which we were conducted into a 
 carriage, and loud cheers of welcome, sent a throb, as 
 the voice of living Scotland. 
 
 I looked out of the carriage, as we drove on, and 
 saw, by the light of a lantern, Argyll Street. It was 
 past twelve o clock when I found myself in a warm, 
 cosy parlor, with friends whom I have ever since been 
 glad to remember. In a little time we were all safely 
 

<page 246>
PUBLIC RECEPTIONS. 211 
 
 housed in our hospitable apartments, and sleep fell on 
 me for the first time in Scotland. 
 
 The next morning I awoke worn and weary, and 
 scarce could the charms of the social Scotch breakfast 
 restore me. 
 
 Our friend and host was Mr. Bailie Paton. I believe 
 that it is to his suggestion in a public meeting that we 
 owe the invitation which brought us to Scotland. 
 
 After breakfast the visiting began. First, a friend 
 of the family, with three beautiful children, the young 
 est of whom was the bearer of a handsomely bound al 
 bum, containing a pressed collection of the sea-mosses 
 of the Scottish coast, very vivid and beautiful. 
 
 All this day is a confused dream to me of a dizzy 
 and overwhelming kind. So many letters that it took 
 brother Charles from nine in the morning till two in 
 the afternoon to read and answer them in the shortest 
 manner ; letters from all classes of people, high and 
 low, rich and poor, in all shades and styles of composi 
 tion, poetry and prose ; some mere outbursts of feel 
 ing ; some invitations ; some advice and suggestions ; 
 some requests and inquiries ; some presenting books, or 
 flowers, or fruit. 
 
 Then came, in their turn, deputations from Paisley, 
 Greenock, Dundee, Aberdeen, Edinburgh, and Belfast 
 in Ireland ; calls of friendship, invitations of all de 
 scriptions to go everywhere, and to see everything, and 
 to stay in so many places. One kind, venerable minis 
 ter, with his lovely daughter, offered me a retreat in 
 his quiet manse on the beautiful shores of the Clyde. 
 
 For all these kindnesses, what could I give in return ? 
 There was scarce time for even a grateful thought on 
 

<page 247>
212 SUNNY MEMORIES. 
 
 each. People have often said to me that it must have 
 been an exceeding bore. For my part, I could not 
 think of regarding it so. It only oppressed me with an 
 unutterable sadness. 
 
 In the afternoon I rode out with the lord provost to 
 see the cathedral. The lord provost answers to the 
 lord mayor in England. His title and office in both 
 countries continue only a year, except in case of re 
 election. 
 
 As I saw the way to the cathedral blocked up by a 
 throng of people who had come out to see me, I could 
 not help saying, &quot; What went ye out for to see ? a 
 reed shaken with the wind ? &quot; In fact I was so worn 
 out that I could hardly walk through the building. 
 The next morning I was so ill as to need a physician, 
 unable to see any one that called, or to hear any of the 
 letters. I passed most of the day in bed, but in the 
 evening I had to get up, as I had engaged to drink tea 
 with two thousand people. Our kind friends, Dr. and 
 Mrs. Wardlaw, came after us, and Mr. S. and I went in 
 the carriage with them. Our carriage stopped at last 
 at the place. I have a dim remembrance of a way be 
 ing made for us through a great crowd all round the 
 house, and of going with Mrs. Wardlaw up into a 
 dressing-room where I met and shook hands with many 
 friendly people. Then we passed into a gallery, where 
 a seat was reserved for our party, directly in front of 
 the audience. Our friend Bailie Paton presided. Mrs. 
 Wardlaw and I sat together, and around us many 
 friends, chiefly ministers of the different churches, the 
 ladies and gentlemen of the Glasgow Anti-Slavery So 
 ciety and others. I told you it was a tea-party ; but 
 

<page 248>
A TEA-PARTY. 213 
 
 the arrangements were altogether different from any I 
 had ever seen. There were narrow tables stretched up 
 and down the whole extent of the great hall, and every 
 person had an appointed seat. These tables were set 
 out with cups and saucers, cakes, biscuit, etc., and when 
 the proper time came, attendants passed along serving 
 tea. The arrangements were so accurate and methodi 
 cal that the whole multitude actually took tea together, 
 without the least apparent inconvenience or disturbance. 
 
 There was a gentle, subdued murmur of conversation 
 all over the house, the sociable clinking of teacups and 
 teaspoons, while the entertainment was going on. It 
 seemed to me such an odd idea, I could not help won 
 dering what sort of a teapot that must be in which all 
 this tea for two thousand people was made. Truly, as 
 Hadji Baba says, I think they must have had the 
 &quot; father of all the tea-kettles &quot; to boil it in. I could 
 not help wondering if old mother Scotland had put two 
 thousand teaspoonfuls of tea for the company, and one 
 for the teapot, as is our good Yankee custom. 
 
 We had quite a sociable time up in our gallery. Our 
 tea-table stretched quite across, and we drank tea in 
 sight of all the people. By we, I mean a great num 
 ber of ministers and their wives, and ladies of the Anti- 
 Slavery Society, besides our party, and the friends 
 whom I have mentioned before. All seemed to be en 
 joying themselves. 
 
 After tea they sang a few verses of the seventy-sec 
 ond psalm in the old Scotch version. 
 
 April 17. To-day a large party of us started on a 
 small steamer to go down the Clyde. It was a trip full 
 of pleasure and incident. Now we were shown the re- 
 

<page 249>
214 SUNNY MEMORIES. 
 
 mains of old Cardross Castle, where it was said Robert 
 Bruce breathed his last. And now we came near the 
 beautiful grounds of Roseneath, a green, velvet-like pe 
 ninsula, stretching out into the widening waters. 
 
 Somewhere about here I was presented, by his own 
 request, to a broad-shouldered Scotch farmer, who stood 
 some six feet two, and who paid me the compliment to 
 say that he had read my book, and that he would walk 
 six miles to see me any day. Such a flattering evidence 
 of discriminating taste, of course, disposed my heart 
 towards him ; but when I went up and put my hand 
 into his great prairie of a palm, I was as a grasshopper 
 in my own eyes. I inquired who he was and was told 
 he was one of the Duke of Argyll s farmers. I thought 
 to myself if all the duke s farmers were of this pattern, 
 that he might be able to speak to the enemy in the 
 gates to some purpose. 
 
 It was concluded after we left Roseneath that, instead 
 of returning by the boat, we should take carriage and 
 ride home along the banks of the river. In our car 
 riage were Mr. S. and myself, Dr. Robson, and Lady 
 Anderson. About this time I commenced my first es 
 say towards giving titles, and made, as you may sup 
 pose, rather an odd piece of work of it, generally say 
 ing &quot; Mrs.&quot; first, and &quot; Lady &quot; afterwards, and then 
 begging pardon. Lady Anderson laughed and said 
 she would give me a general absolution. She is a truly 
 genial, hearty Scotchwoman, and seemed to enter hap 
 pily into the spirit of the hour. 
 
 As we rode on, we found that the news of our com 
 ing had spread through the village. People came and 
 stood in their doors, beckoning, bowing, smiling, and 
 

<page 250>
GREETINGS FROM THE PEOPLE. 215 
 
 waving their handkerchiefs, and the carriage was sev 
 eral times stopped by persons who came to offer flowers. 
 I remember, in particular, a group of young girls bring 
 ing to the carriage two of the most beautiful children 
 I ever saw, whose little hands literally deluged us with 
 flowers. 
 
 At the village of Helensburgh we stopped a little 
 while to call upon Mrs. Bell, the wife of Mr. Bell, the 
 inventor of the steamboat. His invention in this coun 
 try was at about the same time as that of Fulton in 
 America. Mrs. Bell came to the carriage to speak to 
 us. She is a venerable woman, far advanced in years. 
 They had prepared a lunch for us, and quite a number 
 of people had come together to meet us, but our friends 
 said there was not time for us to stop. 
 
 We rode through several villages after this, and met 
 everywhere a warm welcome. What pleased me was, 
 that it was not mainly from the literary, nor the rich, 
 nor the great, but the plain, common people. The 
 butcher came out of his stall and the baker from his 
 shop, the miller dusty with flour, the blooming, comely 
 young mother, with her baby in her arms, all smiling 
 and bowing, with that hearty, intelligent, friendly look, 
 as if they knew we should be glad to see them. 
 
 Once, while we stopped to change horses, I, for the 
 sake of seeing something more of the country, walked 
 on. It seems the honest landlord and his wife were 
 greatly disappointed at this ; however, they got into 
 the carriage and rode on to see me, and I shook hands 
 with them with a right good will. 
 
 We saw several of the clergymen, who came out to 
 meet us ; and I remember stopping just to be intro- 
 

<page 251>
216 SUNNY MEMORIES. 
 
 duced, one by one, to a most delightful family, a gray- 
 headed father and mother, with comely brothers and 
 fair sisters, all looking so kindly and homelike, that I 
 should have been glad to accept the invitation they 
 gave me to their dwelling. 
 
 This day has been a strange phenomenon to me. In 
 the first place, I have seen in all these villages how 
 universally the people read. I have seen how capable 
 they are of a generous excitement and enthusiasm, and 
 how much may be done by a work of fiction so writ 
 ten as to enlist those sympathies which are common to 
 all classes. Certainly a great deal may be effected in 
 this way, if God gives to any one the power, as I hope 
 he will to many. The power of fictitious writing, for 
 good as well as evil, is a thing which ought most seri 
 ously to be reflected on. No one can fail to see that 
 in our day it is becoming a very great agency.^ 
 
 We came home quite tired, as you may well suppose. 
 You will not be surprised that the next day I found 
 myself more disposed to keep my bed than go out. 
 
 Two days later : We bade farewell to Glasgow, over 
 whelmed with kindness to the last, and only oppressed 
 by the thought of how little that was satisfactory we 
 were able to give in return. Again we were in the rail 
 road car on our way to Edinburgh. A pleasant two 
 hours trip is this from Glasgow to Edinburgh. When 
 the cars stopped at Linlithgow station, the name started 
 us as out of a dream. 
 
 In Edinburgh the cars stopped amid a crowd of peo 
 ple who had assembled to meet us. The lord provost 
 met us at the door of the car, and presented us to the 
 magistracy of the city and the committees of the Edin- 
 

<page 252>
EDINBURGH. 217 
 
 burgh Anti-Slavery Societies. The drab dresses and 
 pure white bonnets of many Friends were conspicuous 
 among the dense moving crowd, as white doves seen 
 against a dark cloud. Mr. S. and myself, and our 
 future hostess, Mrs. Wigham, entered the carriage with 
 the lord provost, and away we drove, the crowd follow 
 ing with their shouts and cheers. I was inexpressibly 
 touched and affected by this. While we were passing 
 the monument of Scott, I felt an oppressive melan 
 choly. What a moment life seems in the presence of 
 the noble dead ! What a momentary thing is art, in 
 all its beauty ! Where are all those great souls that 
 have created such an atmosphere of light about Edin 
 burgh ? and how little a space was given them to live 
 and enjoy ! 
 
 We drove all over Edinburgh, up to the castle, to the 
 university, to Holyrood, to the hospitals, and through 
 many of the principal streets, amid shouts, and smiles, 
 and greetings. Some boys amused me very much by 
 their pertinacious attempts to keep up with the car 
 riage. 
 
 &quot; Heck,&quot; says one of them, &quot; that s her ; see the 
 courls ! &quot; 
 
 The various engravers who have amused themselves 
 by diversifying my face for the public having all, with 
 great unanimity, agreed in giving prominence to this 
 point, I suppose the urchins thought they were on safe 
 ground there. I certainly think I answered one good 
 purpose that day, and that is of giving the much-op 
 pressed and calumniated class called boys an opportu 
 nity to develop all the noise that was in them, a thing 
 for which I think they must bless me in their remem 
 brances. 
 

<page 253>

 At last the carriage drove into a deep-graveled yard, 
 and we alighted at a porch covered with green ivy, and 
 found ourselves once more at home. 
 
 You may spare your anxieties about me, for I do as 
 sure you that if I were an old Sevres china jar I could 
 not have more careful handling than I do. Everybody 
 is considerate ; a great deal to say when there appears 
 to be so much excitement. Everybody seems to under 
 stand how good-for-nothing I am; and yet, with all 
 this consideration, I have been obliged to keep my room 
 and bed for a good part of the time. Of the multi 
 tudes who have called, I have seen scarcely any. 
 
 To-morrow evening is to be the great tea-party here. 
 How in the world I am ever to live through it I don t 
 know. 
 
 The amount of letters we found waiting for us here 
 in Edinburgh was, if possible, more appalling than in 
 Glasgow. Among those from persons whom you would 
 be interested in hearing of, I may mention a very kind 
 and beautiful one from the Duchess of Sutherland, and 
 one also from the Earl of Carlisle, both desiring to 
 make appointments for meeting us as soon as we come 
 to London. Also a very kind and interesting note from 
 the Rev. Mr. Kingsley and lady. I look forward with 
 a great deal of interest to passing a little time with 
 them in their rectory. 
 
 As to all engagements, I am in a state of happy ac 
 quiescence, having resigned myself, as a very tame lion, 
 into the hands of my keepers. Whenever the time 
 comes for me to do anything, I try to behave as well as 
 I can, which, as Dr. Young says, is all that an angel 
 could do under the same circumstances. 
 

<page 254>
THE PENNY OFFERING. 219 
 
 April 26. Last night came off the soiree. The 
 hall was handsomely decorated with flags in front. 
 We went with the lord provost in his carriage. We 
 went up as before into a dressing-room, where I was 
 presented to many gentlemen and ladies. When we go 
 in, the cheering, clapping, and stamping at first strikes 
 one with a strange sensation ; but then everybody looks 
 so heartily pleased and delighted, and there is such an 
 all-pervading atmosphere of geniality and sympathy, as 
 makes me in a few moments feel quite at home. After 
 all, I consider that these cheers and applauses are Scot 
 land s voice to America, a recognition of the brother 
 hood of the countries. 
 
 The national penny offering, consisting of a thou 
 sand golden sovereigns on a magnificent silver salver, 
 stood conspicuously in view of the audience. It has 
 been an unsolicited offering, given in the smallest sums, 
 often from the extreme poverty of the giver. The 
 committee who collected it in Edinburgh and Glasgow 
 bore witness to the willingness with which the very 
 poorest contributed the offering of their sympathy. In 
 one cottage they found a blind woman, and said, 
 &quot; Here, at least, is one who will feel no interest, as she 
 cannot have read the book.&quot; 
 
 &quot; Indeed,&quot; said the old lady, &quot; if I cannot read, my 
 son has read it to me, and I ve got my penny saved to 
 give.&quot; 
 
 It is to my mind extremely touching to see how the 
 poor, in their poverty, can be moved to a generosity 
 surpassing that of the rich. Nor do I mourn that they 
 took it from their slender store, because I know that a 
 penny given from a kindly impulse is a greater comfort 
 

<page 255>
220 SUNNY MEMORIES. 
 
 and blessing to the poorest giver than even a penny re 
 ceived. 
 
 As in the case of the other meeting, we came out 
 long before the speeches were ended. Well, of course 
 I did not sleep all night, and the next day I felt quite 
 miserable. 
 
 From Edinburgh we took cars for Aberdeen. I en 
 joyed this ride more than anything we had seen yet, the 
 country was so wild and singular. In the afternoon we 
 came in sight of the German Ocean. The free, bra 
 cing air from the sea, and the thought that it actually 
 was the German Ocean, and that over the other side 
 was Norway, within a day s sail of us, gave it a strange, 
 romantic charm. It was towards the close of the after 
 noon that we found ourselves crossing the Dee, in view 
 of Aberdeen. My spirits were wonderfully elated : the 
 grand scenery and fine, bracing air ; the noble, distant 
 view of the city, rising with its harbor and shipping, 
 all filled me with delight. In this propitious state, dis 
 posed to be pleased with everything, our hearts re 
 sponded warmly to the greetings of the many friends 
 who were waiting for us at the station-house. 
 
 The lord provost received us into his carriage, and 
 as we drove along pointed out to us the various objects 
 of interest in the beautiful town. Among other things, 
 a fine old bridge across the Dee attracted our particular 
 attention. We were conducted to the house of Mr. 
 Cruikshank, a Friend, and found waiting for us there 
 the thoughtful hospitality which we had ever experi 
 enced in all our stopping-places. A snug little quiet 
 supper was laid out upon the table, of which we par 
 took in haste, as we were informed that the assembly at 
 the hall were waiting to receive us. 
 

<page 256>
ABERDEEN. 221 
 
 There arrived, we found the hall crowded, and with 
 difficulty made our way to the platform. Whether 
 owing to the stimulating effect of the air from the 
 ocean, or to the comparatively social aspect of the scene, 
 or perhaps to both, certain it is that we enjoyed the 
 meeting with great zest. I was surrounded on the stage 
 with blooming young ladies, one of whom put into my 
 hands a beautiful bouquet, some flowers of which I 
 have now, dried, in my album. The refreshment tables 
 were adorned with some exquisite wax flowers, the work, 
 as I was afterwards told, of a young lady in the place. 
 One of these designs especially interested me. It was 
 a group of water-lilies resting on a mirror, which gave 
 them the appearance of growing in the water. 
 
 We had some very animated speaking, in which the 
 speakers contrived to blend enthusiastic admiration and 
 love for America with detestation of slavery. 
 
 They presented an offering in a beautiful embroid 
 ered purse, and after much shaking of hands we went 
 home, and sat down to the supper-table for a little more 
 chat before going to bed. The next morning as we 
 had only till noon to stay in Aberdeen our friends, 
 the lord provost and Mr. Leslie, the architect, came im 
 mediately after breakfast to show us the place. 
 
 About two o clock we started from Aberdeen, among 
 crowds of friends, to whom we bade farewell with real 
 regret. 
 
 At Stonehaven station, where we stopped a few min 
 utes, there was quite a gathering of the inhabitants to 
 exchange greetings, and afterwards, at successive sta 
 tions along the road, many a kindly face and voice made 
 our journey a pleasant one. 
 

<page 257>
222 SUNNY MEMORIES. 
 
 When we got into Dundee it seemed all alive with 
 welcome. We went in the carriage with the lord pro 
 vost, Mr. Thorns, to his residence, where a party had 
 been waiting dinner for us for some time. 
 
 The meeting in the evening was in a large church, 
 densely crowded, and conducted much as the others 
 had been. When they came to sing the closing hymn, 
 I hoped they would sing Dundee; but they did not, 
 and I fear in Scotland, as elsewhere, the characteristic 
 national melodies are giving way before more modern 
 ones. 
 
 We left Dundee at two o clock, by cars, for Edin 
 burgh again, and in the evening attended another soiree 
 of the workingmen of Edinburgh. We have received 
 letters from the workingmen, both in Dundee and 
 Glasgow, desiring our return to attend soirees in those 
 cities. Nothing could give us greater pleasure, had we 
 time or strength. The next day we had a few calls to 
 make, and an invitation from Lady Drummond to visit 
 classic Hawthornden, which, however, we had not time 
 to accept. In the forenoon, Mr. S. and I called on 
 Lord and Lady Gainsborough. Though she is one of 
 the queen s household, she is staying here at Edinburgh 
 while the queen is at Osborne. I infer, therefore, that 
 the appointment includes no very onerous duties. The 
 Earl of Gainsborough is the eldest brother of the Rev. 
 Baptist W. Noel. . 
 
 It was a rainy, misty morning when I left my kind 
 retreat and friends in Edinburgh. Considerate as every 
 body had been about imposing on my time or strength, 
 still you may well believe that I was much exhausted. 
 We left Edinburgh, therefore, with the determination 
 

<page 258>
JOSEPH STURGE. 223 
 
 to plunge at once into some hidden and unknown spot, 
 where we might spend two or three days quietly by our 
 selves ; and remembering your Sunday at Stratf ord-on- 
 Avon, I proposed that we should go there. As Strat 
 ford, however, is off the railroad line, we determined to 
 accept the invitation, which was lying by us, from our 
 friend, Joseph Sturge, of Birmingham, and take sanctu 
 ary with him. So we wrote on, intrusting him with the 
 secret, and charging him on no account to let any one 
 know of our arrival. 
 
 About night our cars whizzed into the depot at Bir 
 mingham ; but just before we came in a difficulty was 
 started in the company. &quot;Mr. Sturge is to be there 
 waiting for us, but he does not know us and we don t 
 know him ; what is to be done ? &quot; C. insisted that 
 he should know him by instinct ; and so, after we 
 reached the depot, we told him to sally out and try. 
 Sure enough, in a few moments he pitched upon a 
 cheerful, middle-aged gentleman, with a moderate but 
 not decisive broad brim to his hat, and challenged him 
 as Mr. Sturge. The result verified the truth that &quot; in 
 stinct is a great matter.&quot; In a few moments our new 
 friend and ourselves were snugly encased in a fly, trot 
 ting off as briskly as ever we could to his place at 
 Edgbaston, nobody a whit the wiser. You do not 
 know how pleased we felt to think we had done it so 
 nicely. 
 
 As we were drinking tea that evening, Elihu Burritt 
 came in. It was the first time I had ever seen him, 
 though I had heard a great deal of him from our 
 friends in Edinburgh. He is a man in middle life, tall 
 and slender, with fair complexion, blue eyes, an air of 
 

<page 259>
224 SUNNY MEMORIES. 
 
 delicacy and refinement, and manners of great gentle 
 ness. My ideas of the &quot; learned blacksmith &quot; had been 
 of something altogether more ponderous and peremp 
 tory. Elihu has been for some years operating, in Eng 
 land and on the Continent, in a movement which many 
 in our half-Christianized times regard with as much 
 incredulity as the grim, old warlike barons did the sus 
 picious imbecilities of reading and writing. The sword 
 now, as then, seems so much more direct a way to termi 
 nate controversies, that many Christian men, even, can 
 not conceive how the world is to get along without it. 
 
 We spent the evening in talking over various topics 
 relating to the anti-slavery movement. Mr. Sturge was 
 very confident that something more was to be done than 
 had ever been done yet, by combinations for the en 
 couragement of free in the place of slave grown 
 produce ; a question which has, ever since the days of 
 Clarkson, more or less deeply occupied the minds of 
 abolitionists in England. I should say that Mr. Sturge 
 in his family has for many years conscientiously for 
 borne the use of any article produced by slave labor. I 
 could scarcely believe it possible that there could be 
 such an abundance and variety of all that is comfortable 
 and desirable in the various departments of household 
 living within these limits. Mr. Sturge presents the 
 subject with very great force, the more so from the 
 consistency of his example. 
 
 The next morning, as we were sitting down to break 
 fast, our friends sent in to me a plate of the largest, 
 finest strawberries I have ever seen, which, considering 
 that it was only the latter part of April, seemed to me 
 quite an astonishing luxury. 
 

<page 260>
BIRMINGHAM. 225 
 
 Before we left, we had agreed to meet a circle of 
 friends from Birmingham, consisting of the Abolition 
 Society there, which is of long standing, extending back 
 in its memories to the very commencement of the agi 
 tation under Clarkson and Wilberforce. The windows 
 of the parlor were opened to the ground ; and the com 
 pany invited filled not only the room, but stood f in a 
 crowd on the grass around the window. Among the 
 peaceable company present was an admiral in the navy, 
 a fine, cheerful old gentleman, who entered with hearty 
 interest into the scene. 
 
 A throng of friends accompanied us to the depot, 
 while from Birmingham we had the pleasure of the 
 company of Elihu Burritt, and enjoyed a delightful run 
 to London, where we arrived towards evening. 
 
 At the station-house in London we found the Rev. 
 Messrs. Binney and Sherman waiting for us with car 
 riages. C. went with Mr. Sherman, and Mr. S. and 
 I soon found ourselves in a charming retreat called 
 Rose Cottage, in Walworth, about which I will tell 
 you more anon. Mrs. B. received us with every atten 
 tion which the most thoughtful hospitality could sug 
 gest. One of the first things she said to me after we 
 got into our room was, &quot; Oh, we are so glad you have 
 come ! for we are all going to the lord mayor s dinner 
 to-night, and you are invited.&quot; So, though I was tired, 
 I hurried to dress in all the glee of meeting an adven 
 ture. As soon as Mr. and Mrs. B. and the rest of the 
 party were ready, crack went the whip, round went the 
 wheels, and away we drove. 
 
 We found a considerable throng, and I was glad to 
 accept a seat which was offered me in the agreeable 
 

<page 261>
226 SUNNY MEMORIES. 
 
 vicinity of the lady mayoress, so that I might see what 
 would be interesting to me of the ceremonial. 
 
 A very dignified gentleman, dressed in black velvet, 
 with a fine head, made his way through the throng, 
 and sat down by me, introducing himself as Lord Chief 
 Baron Pollock. He told me he had just been reading 
 the legal part of the &quot; Key to Uncle Tom s Cabin,&quot; 
 and remarked especially on the opinion of Judge 
 Ruffin, in the case of State v. Mann, as having made 
 a deep impression on his mind. 
 
 Dinner was announced between nine and ten o clock, 
 and we were conducted into a splendid hall, where the 
 tables were laid. 
 
 Directly opposite me was Mr. Dickens, whom I now 
 beheld for the first time, and was surprised to see look 
 ing so young. Mr. Justice Talfourd, known as the 
 author of &quot; Ion,&quot; was also there with his lady. She 
 had a beautiful, antique cast of head. The lord mayor 
 was simply dressed in black, without any other adorn 
 ment than a massive gold chain. We rose from table 
 between eleven and twelve o clock that is, we ladies 
 and went into the drawing-room, where I was pre 
 sented to Mrs. Dickens and several other ladies. Mrs. 
 Dickens is a good specimen of a truly English woman ; 
 tall, large, and well developed, with fine, healthy color, 
 and an air of frankness, cheerfulness, and reliability. 
 A friend whispered to me that she was as observing 
 and fond of humor as her husband. 
 
 After a while the gentlemen came back to the draw 
 ing-room, and I had a few moments of very pleasant, 
 friendly conversation with Mr. Dickens. They are both 
 people that one could not know a little of without de 
 siring to know more. 
 

<page 262>
WEARINESS. 227 
 
 After a little we began to talk of separating ; the 
 lord mayor to take his seat in the House of Commons, 
 and the rest of the party to any other engagement that 
 might be upon their list. 
 
 &quot; Come, let us go to the House of Commons,&quot; said 
 one of my friends, &quot; and make a night of it.&quot; &quot; With 
 all my heart,&quot; replied I, &quot; if I only had another body 
 to go into to-morrow.&quot; 
 
 What a convenience in sight-seeing it would be if 
 one could have a relay of bodies as of clothes, and slip 
 from one into the other ! But we, not used to the Lon 
 don style of turning night into day, are full weary 
 already. So good-night to you all.

 ROSE COTTAGE, WALWORTH, LONDON, May 2, 1856. 
 
 MY DEAR, This morning Mrs. Follen called and 
 we had quite a chat. We are separated by the whole 
 city. She lives at the West End, while I am down here 
 in Walworth, which is one of the postscripts of Lon 
 don, for this place has as many postscripts as a lady s 
 letter. This evening we dined with the Earl of Carlisle. 
 There was no company but ourselves, for he, with great 
 consideration, said in his note that he thought a little 
 quiet would be the best thing he could offer. 
 
 Lord Carlisle is a great friend to America, and so is 
 his sister, the Duchess of Sutherland. He is the only 
 English traveler who ever wrote notes on our country 
 in a real spirit of appreciation. 
 
 We went about seven o clock, the dinner hour being 
 here somewhere between eight and nine. We were 
 shown into an ante-room adjoining the entrance hall, 
 and from that into an adjacent apartment, where we 
 met Lord Carlisle. The room had a pleasant, social 
 

<page 264>
DINES WITH LORD CARLISLE. 229 
 
 air, warmed and enlivened by the blaze of a coal fire 
 and wax candles. 
 
 We had never, any of us, met Lord Carlisle before ; 
 but the considerateness and cordiality of our reception 
 obviated whatever embarrassment there might have 
 been in this circumstance. In a few moments after we 
 were all seated, a servant announced the Duchess of 
 Sutherland, and Lord Carlisle presented me. She is tall 
 and stately, with a most noble bearing. Her fair com 
 plexion, blonde hair, and full lips speak of Saxon blood. 
 
 The only person present not of the family connec 
 tion was my quondam correspondent in America, Arthur 
 Helps. Somehow or other I had formed the impres 
 sion from his writings that he was a venerable sage of 
 very advanced years, who contemplated life as an aged 
 hermit from the door of his cell. Conceive my sur 
 prise to find a genial young gentleman of about twenty- 
 five, who looked as if he might enjoy a joke as well as 
 another man. 
 
 After the ladies left the table, the conversation 
 turned on the Maine law, which seems to be considered 
 over here as a phenomenon in legislation, and many of 
 the gentlemen present inquired about it with great 
 curiosity. 
 
 After the gentlemen rejoined us, the Duke and 
 Duchess of Argyll came in, and Lord and Lady Blan- 
 tyre. These ladies are the daughters of the Duchess 
 of Sutherland. The Duchess of Argyll is of slight 
 and fairy-like figure, with flaxen hair and blue eyes, 
 answering well enough to the description of Annot 
 Lyle in the Legend of Montrose. Lady Blantyre was 
 somewhat taller, of fuller figure, with a very brilliant 
 

<page 265>
230 FROM OVER THE SEA. 
 
 bloom. Lord Blantyre is of the Stuart blood, a tall 
 and slender young man with very graceful manners. 
 
 As to the Duke of Argyll, we found that the picture 
 drawn of him by his countrymen in Scotland was in 
 every way correct. Though slight of figure, with fair 
 complexion and blue eyes, his whole appearance is in 
 dicative of energy and vivacity. His talents and effi 
 ciency have made him a member of the British Cabinet 
 at a much earlier age than is usual ; and he has dis 
 tinguished himself not only in political life, but as a 
 writer, having given to the world a work on Presby- 
 terianism, embracing an analysis of the ecclesiastical 
 history of Scotland since the Reformation, which is 
 spoken of as written with great ability, and in a most 
 liberal spirit. He made many inquiries about our dis 
 tinguished men, particularly of Emerson, Longfellow, 
 and Hawthorne ; also of Prescott, who appears to be a 
 general favorite here. I felt at the moment that we 
 never value our own literary men so much as when we 
 are placed in a circle of intelligent foreigners. 
 
 The following evening we went to dine with our old 
 friends of the Dingle, Mr. and Mrs. Edward Cropper, 
 who are now spending a little time in London. We 
 were delighted to meet them once more and to hear 
 from our Liverpool friends. Mrs. Cropper s father, 
 Lord Denman, has returned to England, though with 
 no sensible improvement in his health. 
 
 At dinner we were introduced to Lord and Lady 
 Hatherton. Lady Hatherton is a person of great culti 
 vation and intelligence, warmly interested in all the 
 progressive movements of the day ; and I gained much 
 information in her society. There were also present 
 

<page 266>
AT MR. CROPPERS. 231 
 
 Sir Charles and Lady Trevelyan ; the former holds an 
 appointment at the treasury, and Lady Trevelyan is a 
 sister of Macaulay. 
 
 In the evening quite a circle came in, among others 
 Lady Emma Camphell, sister of the Duke of Argyll ; 
 the daughters of the Archbishop of Canterbury, who 
 very kindly invited me to visit them at Lambeth ; and 
 Mr. Arthur Helps, besides many others whose names I 
 need not mention. 
 
 May 7. This evening our house was opened in a 
 general way for callers, who were coming and going all 
 the evening. I think there must have been over two 
 hundred people, among them Martin Farquhar T upper, 
 a little man with fresh, rosy complexion and cheery, 
 joyous manners ; and Mary Howitt, just such a cheer 
 ful, sensible, fireside companion as we find her in her 
 books, winning love and trust the very first moment 
 of the interview. 
 
 The general topic of remark on meeting me seems to 
 be, that I am not so bad-looking as they were afraid I 
 was ; and I do assure you that when I have seen the 
 things that are put up in the shop windows here with 
 my name under them, I have been in wondering admi 
 ration at the boundless loving-kindness of my English 
 and Scottish friends in keeping up such a warm heart 
 for such a Gorgon. I should think that the Sphinx in 
 the London Museum might have sat for most of them. 
 I am going to make a collection of these portraits to 
 bring home to you. There is a great variety of them, 
 and they will be useful, like the Irishman s guide-board, 
 which showed where the road did not go. 
 
 Before the evening was through I was talked out 
 

<page 267>

 and worn out ; there was hardly a chip of me left. 
 To-morrow at eleven o clock comes the meeting at Staf 
 ford House. What it will amount to I do not know ; 
 but I take no thought for the morrow. 
 
 May 8. 
 
 MY DEAR C., In fulfillment of my agreement I 
 will tell you, as nearly as I can remember, all the de 
 tails of the meeting at Stafford House. At about 
 eleven o clock we drove under the arched carriage-way 
 of a mansion externally not very showy in appearance. 
 
 When the duchess appeared, I thought she looked 
 handsomer by daylight than in the evening. She re 
 ceived us with the same warm and simple kindness 
 which she had shown before. We were presented to 
 the Duke of Sutherland. He is a tall, slender man, 
 with rather a thin face, light-brown hair, and a mild 
 blue eye, with an air of gentleness and dignity. 
 
 Among the first that entered were the members of 
 the family, the Duke and Duchess of Argyll, Lord and 
 Lady Blantyre, the Marquis and Marchioness of Staf 
 ford, and Lady Emma Campbell. Then followed Lord 
 Shaftesbury with his beautiful lady, and her father and 
 mother, Lord and Lady Palmerston. Lord Palmerston 
 is of middle height, with a keen dark eye and black 
 hair streaked with gray. There is something peculiarly 
 alert and vivacious about all his movements ; in short, 
 his appearance perfectly answers to what we know of 
 him from his public life. One has a strange, mytho 
 logical feeling about the existence of people of whom 
 one hears for many years without ever seeing them. 
 While talking with Lord Palmerston I could but re 
 member how often I had heard father and Mr. S. exult- 
 

<page 268>
STAFFORD HOUSE. 233 
 
 ing over his foreign dispatches by our own fireside. 
 There were present, also, Lord John Russell, Mr. Glad 
 stone, and Lord Granville. The latter we all thought 
 very strikingly resembled in his appearance the poet 
 Longfellow. 
 
 After lunch the whole party ascended to the picture- 
 gallery, passing on our way the grand staircase and 
 hall, said to be the most magnificent in Europe. The 
 company now began to assemble and throng the gallery, 
 and very soon the vast room was crowded. Among 
 the throng I remember many presentations, but of 
 course must have forgotten many more. Archbishop 
 Whateley was there, with Mrs. and Miss Whateley ; 
 Macaulay, with two of his sisters ; Milman, the poet 
 and historian ; the Bishop of Oxford, Chevalier Bunsen 
 and lady, and many more. 
 
 When all the company were together, Lord Shaftes- 
 bury read a very short, kind, and considerate address 
 in behalf of the ladies of England, expressive of their 
 cordial welcome. 
 
 This Stafford House meeting, in any view of it, is a 
 most remarkable fact. Kind and gratifying as its 
 arrangements have been to me, I am far from appro 
 priating it to myself individually as a personal honor. 
 I rather regard it as the most public expression possible 
 of the feelings of the women of England on one of 
 the most important questions of our day, that of indi 
 vidual liberty considered in its religious bearings. 
 
 On this occasion the Duchess of Sutherland presented 
 Mrs. Stowe with a superb gold bracelet, made in the 
 form of a slave s shackle, bearing the inscription : &quot; We 
 

<page 269>
234 FROM OVER THE SEA. 
 
 trust it is a memorial of a chain that is soon to be 
 broken.&quot; On two of the links were inscribed the dates 
 of the abolition of the slave-trade and of slavery in Eng 
 lish territory. Years after its presentation to her, Mrs. 
 Stowe was able to have engraved on the clasp of this 
 bracelet, &quot; Constitutional Amendment (forever abolish 
 ing slavery in the United States).&quot; 
 
 Continuing her interesting journal, Mrs. Stowe writes, 
 May 9th : 
 
 DEAR E., This letter I consecrate to you, because I 
 know that the persons and things to be introduced into 
 it will most particularly be appreciated by you. 
 
 In your evening reading circles, Macaulay, Sydney 
 Smith, and Milman have long been such familiar names 
 that you will be glad to go with me over all the scenes 
 of my morning breakfast at Sir Charles Trevelyan s 
 yesterday. Lady Trevelyan, I believe I have said be 
 fore, is a sister of Macaulay. 
 
 We were set down at Westbourne Terrace some 
 where, I believe, about eleven o clock, and found quite 
 a number already in the drawing-room. I had met 
 Macaulay before, but being seated between him and 
 Dean Milman, I must confess I was a little embarrassed 
 at times, because I wanted to hear what they were both 
 saying at the same time. However, by the use of the 
 faculty by which you play a piano with both hands, I 
 got on very comfortably. 
 
 There were several other persons of note present at 
 this breakfast, whose conversation I had not an oppor 
 tunity of hearing, as they sat at a distance from me. 
 There was Lord Glenelg, brother of Sir Robert Grant, 
 

<page 270>
VISIT TO WINDSOR CASTLE. 235 
 
 governor of Bombay, whose beautiful hymns have ren 
 dered him familiar in America. The favorite one, com 
 mencing 
 
 &quot; When gathering clouds around I view,&quot; 
 
 was from his pen. 
 
 The historian Hallam was also present, and I think 
 it very likely there may have been other celebrities 
 whom I did not know. I am always finding out, a day 
 or two after, that I have been with somebody very 
 remarkable and did not know it at the time. 
 
 Under date of May 18th she writes to her sister 
 Mary : 
 
 DEAR M., I can compare the embarrassment of 
 our London life, with its multiplied solicitations and 
 infinite stimulants to curiosity and desire, only to that 
 annual perplexity which used to beset us in our child 
 hood on Thanksgiving Day. Like Miss Edgeworth s 
 philosophic little Frank, we are obliged to make out a 
 list of what man must want, and of what he may want ; 
 and in our list of the former we set down, in large and 
 decisive characters, one quiet day for the exploration 
 and enjoyment of Windsor. 
 
 The ride was done all too soon. About eleven 
 o clock we found ourselves going up the old stone steps 
 to the castle. We went first through the state apart 
 ments. The principal thing that interested me was the 
 ball-room, which was a perfect gallery of Vandyke s 
 paintings. After leaving the ball-room we filed off to 
 the proper quarter to show our orders for the private 
 rooms. The state apartments, which we had been look- 
 

<page 271>
236 FROM OVER THE SEA. 
 
 ing at, are open at all times, but the private apartments 
 can only be seen in the Queen s absence and by a special 
 permission, which had been procured for us on that 
 occasion by the kindness of the Duchess of Sutherland. 
 
 One of the first objects that attracted my attention 
 upon entering the vestibule was a baby s wicker wagon, 
 standing in one corner. It was much such a carriage 
 as all mothers are familiar with ; such as figures largely 
 in the history of almost every family. It had neat cur 
 tains and cushions of green merino, and was not royal, 
 only maternal. I mused over the little thing with a 
 good deal of interest. 
 
 We went for our dinner to the White Hart, the very 
 inn which Shakespeare celebrates in his &quot; Merry Wives,&quot; 
 and had a most overflowing merry time of it. After 
 dinner we had a beautiful drive. 
 
 We were bent upon looking up the church which 
 gave rise to Gray s &quot; Elegy in a Country Churchyard,&quot; 
 intending when we got there to have a little scene over 
 it; Mr. S., in all the conscious importance of having 
 been there before, assuring us that he knew exactly 
 where it was. So, after some difficulty with our coach 
 man, and being stopped at one church which would not 
 answer our purpose in any respect, we were at last set 
 down by one which looked authentic ; embowered in 
 mossy elms, with a most ancient and goblin yew-tree, 
 an ivy-mantled tower, all perfect as could be. Here, 
 leaning on the old fence, we repeated the Elegy, which 
 certainly applies here as beautifully as language could 
 apply. 
 
 Imagine our chagrin, on returning to London, at 
 being informed that we had not been to the genuine 
 

<page 272>
KOSSUTH. 237 
 
 churchyard after all. The gentleman who wept over 
 the scenes of his early days on the wrong doorstep was 
 not more grievously disappointed. However, he and 
 we could both console ourselves with the reflection that 
 the emotion was admirable, and wanted only the right 
 place to make it the most appropriate in the world. 
 
 The evening after our return from Windsor was 
 spent with our kind friends, Mr. and Mrs. Gurney. 
 After breakfast the next day, Mr. S., C., and I drove 
 out to call upon Kossuth. We found him in an ob 
 scure lodging on the outskirts of London. I would 
 that some of the editors in America, who have thrown 
 out insinuations about his living in luxury, could have 
 seen the utter bareness and plainness of the reception 
 room, which had nothing in it beyond the simplest 
 necessaries. He entered into conversation with us with 
 cheerfulness, speaking English well, though with the 
 idioms of foreign languages. When we parted he took 
 my hand kindly and said, &quot; God bless you, my child ! &quot; 
 
 I have been quite amused with something which has 
 happened lately. This week the &quot; Times &quot; has in 
 formed the United Kingdom that Mrs. Stowe is getting 
 a new dress made ! It wants to know if Mrs. Stowe is 
 aware what sort of a place her dress is being made in ; 
 and there is a letter from a dressmaker s apprentice 
 stating that it is being made up piecemeal, in the most 
 shockingly distressed dens of London, by poor, miser 
 able white slaves, worse treated than the plantation 
 slaves of America ! 
 
 Now Mrs. Stowe did not know anything of this, but 
 simply gave the silk into the hands of a friend, and 
 was in due time waited on in her own apartment by a 
 

<page 273>
238 FROM OVER THE SEA. 
 
 very respectable-appearing woman, who offered to make 
 the dress, and lo, this is the result ! Since the publica 
 tion of this piece, I have received earnest missives, from 
 various parts of the country, begging me to interfere, 
 hoping that I was not going to patronize the white 
 slavery of England, and that I would employ my talents 
 equally against oppression in every form. Could these 
 people only know in what sweet simplicity I had been 
 living in the State of Maine, where the only dressmaker 
 of our circle was an intelligent, refined, well-educated 
 woman who was considered as the equal of us all, and 
 whose spring and faU ministrations to our wardrobe 
 were regarded a double pleasure, a friendly visit as 
 well as a domestic assistance, I say, could they know 
 all this, they would see how guiltless I was in the mat 
 ter. I verily never thought but that the nice, pleasant 
 person who came to measure me for my silk dress was 
 going to take it home and make it herself; it never 
 occurred to me that she was the head of an establish 
 ment. 
 
 May 22, she writes to her husband, whose duties had 
 obliged him to return to America : &quot; To-day we went to 
 hear a sermon in behalf of the ragged schools by the 
 Archbishop of Canterbury. My thoughts have been 
 much saddened by the news which I received of the 
 death of Mary Edmonson.&quot; 
 
 &quot; May 30. The next day from my last letter came 
 off Miss Greenfield s concert, of which I send a card. 
 You see in what company they have put your poor little 
 wife. Funny ! is n t it ? Well, the Hons. and Right 
 Hons. all were there. I sat by Lord Carlisle. 
 

<page 274>
FIRST MEETS LADY BYRON. 239 
 
 &quot; After the concert the duchess asked Lady Hather- 
 ton and me to come round to Stafford House and take 
 tea, which was not a thing to be despised, either on ac 
 count of the tea or the duchess. A lovelier time we 
 never had, present, the Duchess of Argyll, Lady 
 Caroline Campbell, Lady Hatherton, and myself. We 
 had the nicest cup of tea, with such cream, and grapes 
 and apricots, with some Italian bread, etc. 
 
 66 When we were going the duchess got me, on some 
 pretext, into another room, and came up and put her 
 arms round me, with her noble face all full of feeling. 
 
 &quot; ( Oh, Mrs. Stowe, I have been reading that last 
 chapter in the &quot; Key &quot; ; Argyll read it aloud to us. 
 Oh, surely, surely you will succeed, God surely will 
 bless you ! 
 
 66 1 said then that I thanked her for all her love and 
 feeling for us, told her how earnestly all the women of 
 England sympathized with her, and many in America. 
 She looked really radiant and inspired. Had those 
 who hang back from our cause seen her face, it might 
 have put a soul into them as she said again, ( It will 
 be done it will be done oh, I trust and pray it 
 may ! 
 
 &quot; So we kissed each other, and vowed friendship and 
 fidelity so I came away. 
 
 &quot; To-day I am going with Lord Shaftesbury to St. 
 Paul s to see the charity children, after which lunch 
 with Dean Milman. 
 
 &quot; May 31. We went to lunch with Miss R. at Ox 
 ford Terrace, where, among a number of distinguished 
 guests, was Lady Byron, with whom I had a few mo 
 ments of deeply interesting &quot;conversation. No engrav- 
 

<page 275>
-40 FROM OVER THE SEA. 
 
 ings that ever have been circulated in America do any 
 justice to her appearance. She is of slight figure, 
 formed with exceeding delicacy, and her whole form, 
 face, dress, and air unite to make an impression of a 
 character singularly dignified, gentle, pure, and yet 
 strong. No words addressed to me in any conversation 
 hitherto have made their way to my inner soul with 
 such force as a few remarks dropped by her on the 
 present religious aspect of England, remarks of such 
 quality as one seldom hears. 
 
 &quot; According to request, I will endeavor to keep you 
 informed of all our goings-on after you left, up to the 
 time of our departure for Paris. 
 
 &quot;We have borne in mind your advice to hasten away 
 to the Continent. Charles wrote, a day or two since, to 
 Mrs. C. at Paris to secure very private lodgings, and 
 by no means let any one know that we were coming. 
 She has replied urging us to come to her house, and 
 promising entire seclusion and rest. So, since you de 
 parted, we have been passing with a kind of compre 
 hensive skip and jump over remaining engagements. 
 And just the evening after you left came off the pres 
 entation of the inkstand by the ladies of Surrey Chapel. 
 
 &quot; It is a beautiful specimen of silver-work, eighteen 
 inches long, with a group of silver figures on it repre 
 senting Religion, with the Bible in her hand, giving lib 
 erty to the slave. The slave is a masterly piece of work. 
 He stands with his hands clasped, looking up to Heaven, 
 while a white man is knocking the shackles from his 
 feet. But the prettiest part of the scene was the pres 
 entation of a gold pen by a band of beautiful children, 
 one of whom made a very pretty speech. I called the 
 

<page 276>
PARIS. 241 
 
 little things to come and stand around me, and talked 
 with them a few minutes, and this was all the speaking 
 that fell to my share. 
 
 &quot; To-morrow we go go to quiet, to obscurity, to 
 peace to Paris, to Switzerland; there we shall find 
 the loveliest glen, and, as the Bible says, fall on 
 sleep/ 
 
 &quot; Paris, June 4. Here we are in Paris, in a most 
 charming family. I have been out all the morning 
 exploring shops, streets, boulevards, and seeing and 
 hearing life in Paris. When one has a pleasant home 
 and friends to return to, this gay, bustling, vivacious, 
 graceful city is one of the most charming things in the 
 world ; and we have a most charming home. 
 
 &quot; I wish the children could see these Tuileries with 
 their statues and fountains, men, women, and children 
 seated in family groups under the trees, chatting, read 
 ing aloud, working muslin, children driving hoop, 
 playing ball, all alive and chattering French. Such 
 fresh, pretty girls as are in the shops here ! Je suis 
 rave, as they say. In short I am decidedly in a French 
 humor, and am taking things quite couleur de rose. 
 
 &quot; Monday, June 13. We went this morning to the 
 studio of M. Belloc, who is to paint my portrait. The 
 first question which he proposed, with a genuine French 
 air, was the question of pose or position. It was 
 concluded that, as other pictures had taken me looking 
 at the spectator, this should take me looking away. M. 
 Belloc remarked that M. Charpentier said I appeared 
 always with the air of an observer, was always look 
 ing around on everything. Hence M. Belloc would 
 take me en observatrice, mais pas en curieuse, with 
 

<page 277>
242 FROM OVER THE SEA. 
 
 the air of observation, but not of curiosity. By and by 
 M. Charpentier came in. He began panegyrizing 6 Un 
 cle Tom/ and this led to a discussion of the ground of 
 its unprecedented success. In his thirty-five years ex 
 perience as a bookseller, he had known nothing like it. 
 It surpassed all modern writings ! At first he would 
 not read it ; his taste was for old masters of a century 
 or two ago. Like M. Belloc in painting/ said I. At 
 length he found his friend M., the first intelligence of 
 the age, reading it. 
 
 &quot; &amp;lt; What, you, too? said he. 
 
 &quot; Ah, ah ! replied the friend ; * say nothing about 
 this book ! There is nothing like it. This leaves us all 
 behind, all, all, miles behind ! 
 
 &quot; M. Belloc said the reason was because there was 
 in it more genuine faith than in any book ; and we 
 branched off into florid eloquence touching paganism, 
 Christianity, and art. 
 
 &quot; Wednesday, June 22. Adieu to Paris ! Ho for 
 Chalons-sur-Saone ! After affectionate farewells of our 
 kind friends, by eleven o clock we were rushing, in the 
 pleasantest of cars, over the smoothest of rails, through 
 Burgundy. We arrived at Chalons at nine P. M. 
 
 &quot; Thursday, 23, eight o clock A. M. Since five we 
 have had a fine bustle on the quay below our win 
 dows. There lay three steamers, shaped for all the 
 world like our last night s rolls. One would think 
 Ichabod Crane might sit astride one of them and dip 
 his feet in the water. They ought to be swift. L Hi- 
 rondelle (The Swallow) flew at five ; another at six. 
 We leave at nine. 
 
 &quot; Lyons. There was a scene of indescribable conf u- 
 

<page 278>
LYONS TO GENEVA. 243 
 
 sion upon our arrival here. Out of the hold of our 
 steamer a man with a rope and hook began hauling 
 baggage up a smooth board. Three hundred people 
 were sorting their goods without checks. Porters were 
 shouldering immense loads, four or five heavy trunks 
 at once, corded together, and stalking off Atlantean. 
 Hat-boxes, bandboxes, and valises burst like a meteoric 
 shower out of a crater. e A moi, a moi ! was the cry, 
 from old men, young women, soldiers, shopkeepers, and 
 frereSy scuffling and shoving together. 
 
 &quot; Saturday, June 25. Lyons to Geneve. As this 
 was our first experience in the diligence line, we noticed 
 particularly every peculiarity. I had had the idea that 
 a diligence was a ricketty, slow-moulded antediluvian 
 nondescript, toiling patiently along over impassable 
 roads at a snail s pace. Judge of my astonishment at 
 finding it a full-blooded, vigorous monster, of unscru 
 pulous railway momentum and imperturbable equipoise 
 of mind. Down the macadamized slopes we thundered 
 at a prodigious pace ; up the hills we trotted, with six 
 horses, three abreast; madly through the little towns 
 we burst, like a whirlwind, crashing across the pebbled 
 streets, and out upon the broad, smooth road again. 
 Before we had well considered the fact that we were out 
 of Lyons we stopped to change horses. Done in a jiffy ; 
 and whoop, crick, crack, whack, rumble, bump, whirr, 
 whisk, away we blazed, till, ere we knew it, another 
 change and another. 
 
 &quot; As evening drew on, a wind sprang up and a storm 
 seemed gathering on the Jura. The rain dashed 
 against the panes of the berlin as we rode past the 
 grim-faced monarch of the misty shroud. It was 
 

<page 279>
244 FROM OVER THE SEA. 
 
 night as we drove into Geneva and stopped at the Mes- 
 sagerie. I heard with joy a voice demanding if this 
 were Madame JBesshare. I replied, not without some 
 scruples of conscience, Oui, Monsieur, c est moi, 
 though the name did not sound exactly like the one to 
 which I had been wont to respond. In half an hour 
 we were at home in the mansion of Monsieur Fazy.&quot; 
 
 From Geneva the party made a tour of the Swiss 
 Alps, spending some weeks among them. While there 
 Charles Beecher wrote from a small hotel at the foot of 
 the Jura : 
 
 &quot; The people of the neighborhood, having discovered 
 who Harriet was, were very kind, and full of delight at 
 seeing her. It was Scotland over again. We have had 
 to be unflinching to prevent her being overwhelmed, 
 both in Paris and Geneva, by the same demonstrations 
 of regard. To this we were driven, as a matter of life 
 and death. It was touching to listen to the talk of 
 these secluded mountaineers. The good hostess, even 
 the servant maids, hung about Harriet, expressing such 
 tender interest for the slave. All had read Uncle 
 Tom ; and it had apparently been an era in their 
 life s monotony, for they said, Oh, madam, do write 
 another ! Remember, our winter nights here are very 
 long ! &quot; 
 
 Upon their return to Geneva they visited the Castle 
 of Chillon, of which, in describing the dungeons, Mrs. 
 Stowe writes : 
 
 &quot; One of the pillars in this vault is covered with names. 
 I think it is Bonnevard s Pillar. There are the names 
 of Byron, Hunt, Schiller, and ever so many more celeb 
 rities. As we were going from the cell our conductress 
 

<page 280>
GRINDELWALD TO MEYRINGEN. 245 
 
 seemed to have a sudden light upon her mind. She 
 asked a question or two of some of our party, and fell 
 upon me vehemently to put my name also there. Char 
 ley scratched it on the soft freestone, and there it is for 
 future ages. The lady could scarce repress her enthu 
 siasm ; she shook my hand over and over again, and 
 said she had read Uncle Tom. It is beautiful, she 
 said, but it is cruel. 
 
 &quot;Monday, July 18. Weather suspicious. Stowed 
 ourselves and our baggage into our voiture, and bade 
 adieu to our friends and to Geneva. Ah, how regret 
 fully ! From the market-place we carried away a bas 
 ket of cherries and fruit as a consolation. Dined at 
 Lausanne, and visited the cathedral and picture-gallery, 
 where was an exquisite Eva. Slept at Meudon. 
 
 &quot; Tuesday, July 19. Rode through Payerne to 
 Freyburg. Stopped at the Zahringer Hof , most ro 
 mantic of inns. 
 
 &quot; Wednesday, July 20. Examined, not the lions, 
 but the bears of Berne. Engaged a voiture and drove 
 to Thun. Dined and drove by the shore of the lake to 
 Interlachen, arriving just after a brilliant sunset. 
 
 &quot; We crossed the Wengern Alps to Grindelwald. 
 The Jungfrau is right over against us, her glaciers 
 purer, tenderer, more dazzlingly beautiful, if possible, 
 than those of Mont Blanc. Slept at Grindelwald.&quot; 
 
 From Rosenlaui, on this journey, Charles Beecher 
 writes : 
 
 &quot; Friday, July 22. Grindelwald to Meyringen. On 
 we came, to the top of the Great Schiedeck, where H. 
 and W. botanized, while I slept. Thence we rode down 
 the mountain till we reached Rosenlaui, where, I am 
 

<page 281>
246 FROM OVER THE SEA. 
 
 free to say, a dinner was to me a more interesting ob 
 ject than a glacier. Therefore, while H. and W. went 
 to the latter, 1 turned off to the inn, amid their cries 
 and reproaches. 
 
 &quot; Here, then, I am, writing these notes in the salle 
 a manger of the inn, where other voyagers are eating 
 and drinking, and there is H. feeding on the green 
 moonshine of an emerald ice cave. One would almost 
 think her incapable of fatigue. How she skips up and 
 down high places and steep places, to the manifest 
 perplexity of the honest guide Kienholz, pere, who 
 tries to take care of her, but does not exactly know 
 how ! She gets on a pyramid of debris, which the edge 
 of the glacier is plowing and grinding up, sits down, 
 and faUs not asleep exactly, but into a trance. W. 
 and I are ready to go on : we shout ; our voice is lost 
 in the roar of the torrent. We send the guide. He 
 goes down, and stands doubtfully. He does not know 
 exactly what to do. She hears him, and starts to her 
 feet, pointing with one hand to yonder peak, and with 
 the other to that knife-like edge that seems cleaving 
 heaven with its keen and glistening cimeter of snow, 
 reminding one of Isaiah s sublime imagery, For my 
 sword is bathed in heaven. She points at the grizzly 
 rocks, with their jags and spear-points. Evidently she 
 is beside herself, and thinks she can remember the 
 names of those monsters, born of earthquake and storm, 
 which cannot be named nor known but by sight, and 
 then are known at once perfectly and forever.&quot; 
 
 After traveling through Germany, Belgium, and 
 Holland, the party returned to Paris toward the end of 
 August, from which place Mrs. Stowe writes : 
 

<page 282>
MADAME BELLOC. 247 
 
 &quot; I am seated in a snug little room at M. Belloc s. 
 The weather is overpoweringly hot, but these Parisian 
 houses seem to have seized and imprisoned coolness. 
 French household ways are delightful. I like their 
 seclusion from the street by these deep-pan ed quad 
 rangles. 
 
 &quot; Madame Belloc was the translator of Maria Edge- 
 worth, by that lady s desire ; corresponded with her for 
 years, and still has many of her letters. Her transla 
 tion of Uncle Tom has to me all the merit and all the 
 interest of an original composition. In perusing it, I 
 enjoy the pleasure of reading the story with scarce any 
 consciousness of its ever having been mine.&quot; 
 
 The next letter is from London en route for America, 
 to which passage had been engaged on the Collins 
 steamer Arctic. In it Mrs. Stowe writes : - 
 
 &quot;London, August 28. Our last letters from home 
 changed all our plans. We concluded to hurry away 
 by the next steamer, if at that late hour we could get a 
 passage. We were all in a bustle. The last shoppings 
 for aunts, cousins, and little folks were to be done by us 
 all. The Palais Royal was to be rummaged ; bronzes, 
 vases, statuettes, bonbons, playthings, all that the end 
 less fertility of Prance could show, was to be looked 
 over for the folks at home. 
 
 &quot; How we sped across the Channel C. relates. We 
 are spending a few very pleasant days with our kind 
 friends the L. s, in London. 
 
 &quot; On board the Arctic, September 7. On Thurs 
 day, September 1, we reached York, and visited the 
 beautiful ruins of St. Mary s Abbey, and the magnifi 
 cent cathedral. It rained with inflexible pertinacity 
 

<page 283>
248 FROM OVER THE SEA. 
 
 during all the time we were there, and the next day it 
 rained still, when we took the cars for Castle Howard 
 station. 
 
 &quot; Lady Carlisle welcomed us most affectionately, and 
 we learned that, had we not been so reserved at the 
 York station in concealing our names, we should have 
 received a note from her. However, as we were safely 
 arrived, it was of no consequence. 
 
 &quot; Our friends spoke much of Sumner and Prescott, 
 who had visited there ; also of Mr. Lawrence, our for 
 mer ambassador, who had visited them just before his 
 return. After a very pleasant day, we left with regret 
 the warmth of this hospitable circle, thus breaking one 
 more of the links that bind us to the English shore. 
 
 &quot; Nine o clock in the evening found us sitting by a 
 cheerful fire in the parlor of Mr. E. Baines at Leeds. 
 The next day the house was filled with company, and 
 the Leeds offering was presented. 
 
 &quot; Tuesday we parted from our excellent friends in 
 Leeds, and soon found ourselves once more in the beau 
 tiful &quot; Dingle,&quot; our first and last resting-place on Eng 
 lish shores. 
 
 &quot; A deputation from Belfast, Ireland, here met me, 
 presenting a beautiful bog-oak casket, lined with gold, 
 and carved with appropriate national symbols, contain 
 ing an offering for the cause of the oppressed. . They 
 read a beautiful address, and touched upon the impor 
 tance of inspiring with the principles of emancipation 
 the Irish nation, whose influence in our land is becom 
 ing so great. Had time and strength permitted, it had 
 been my purpose to visit Ireland, to revisit Scotland, 
 and to see more of England. But it is not in man that

 walketh to direct his steps. And now came parting, 
 leave-taking, last letters, notes, and messages. 
 
 &quot; Thus, almost sadly as a child might leave its home, 
 I left the shores of kind, strong Old England, the 
 mother of us all.&quot;

 HOME AGAIN, 1853-1856. 
 
 ANTI-SLAVERY WORK. STIRRING TIMES IN THE UNITED STATES. 
 ADDRESS TO THE LADIES OF GLASGOW. APPEAL TO THE WOMEN 
 OF AMERICA. CORRESPONDENCE WITH WILLIAM LLOYD GARRI 
 SON. THE WRITING OF &quot; DRED.&quot; FAREWELL LETTER FROM 
 GEORGIANA MAY. SECOND VOYAGE TO ENGLAND. 
 
 AFTER her return in the autumn of 1853 from her 
 European tour, Mrs. Stowe threw herself heart and 
 soul into the great struggle with slavery. Much of her 
 time was occupied in distributing over a wide area of 
 country the English gold with which she had been in 
 trusted for the advancement of the cause. With this 
 money she assisted in the redemption of slaves whose 
 cases were those of peculiar hardship, and helped estab 
 lish them as free men. She supported anti-slavery 
 lectures wherever they were most needed, aided in 
 establishing and maintaining anti-slavery publications, 
 founded and assisted in supporting schools in which 
 colored people might be taught how to avail themselves 
 of the blessings of freedom. She arranged public meet 
 ings, and prepared many of the addresses that should be 
 delivered at them. She maintained such an extensive 
 correspondence with persons of all shades of opinion in 
 all parts of the world, that the letters received and 
 answered by her between 1853 and 1856 would fill vol 
 umes. With all these multifarious interests, her chil- 
 

<page 286>
A LETTER TO FRIENDS IN GLASGOW. 251 
 
 dren received a full share of her attention, nor were her 
 literary activities relaxed. 
 
 Immediately upon the completion of her European 
 tour, her experiences were published in the form of a 
 journal, both in this country and England, under the 
 title of &quot; Sunny Memories.&quot; She also revised and 
 elaborated the collection of sketches which had been 
 published by the Harpers in 1843, under title of &quot; The 
 Mayflower,&quot; and having purchased the plates caused 
 them to be republished in 1855 by Phillips & Samp 
 son, the successors of John P. Jewett & Co., in this 
 country, and by Sampson Low & Co. in London. 
 
 Soon after her return to America, feeling that she 
 owed a debt of gratitude to her friends in Scotland, 
 which her feeble health had not permitted her ade 
 quately to express while with them, Mrs. Stowe wrote 
 the following open letter : 
 
 To THE LADIES ANTI-SLAVERY SOCIETY OF GLASGOW : 
 
 Dear Friends, I have had many things in my 
 mind to say to you, which it was my hope to have said 
 personally, but which I am now obliged to say by letter. 
 
 I have had many fears that you must have thought 
 our intercourse, during the short time that I was in 
 Glasgow, quite unsatisfactory. 
 
 At the time that I accepted your very kind invita 
 tion, I was in tolerable health, and supposed that I 
 should be in a situation to enjoy society, and mingle as 
 much in your social circles as you might desire. 
 
 When the time came for me to fulfil my engagement 
 with you, I was, as you know, confined to my bed with 
 a sickness brought on by the exertion of getting the 
 

<page 287>
252 HOME AGAIN. 
 
 &quot; Key to Uncle Tom s Cabin &quot; through the press dur 
 ing the winter. 
 
 o 
 
 In every part of the world the story of &quot; Uncle Tom &quot; 
 had awakened sympathy for the American slave, and 
 consequently in every part of the world the story of his 
 wrongs had been denied ; it had been asserted to be a 
 mere work of romance, and I was charged with being 
 the slanderer of the institutions of my own country. I 
 knew that if I shrank from supporting my position, the 
 sympathy which the work had excited would gradually 
 die out, and the whole thing w r ould be looked upon as 
 a mere romantic excitement of the passions. 
 
 When I came abroad, I had not the slightest idea of 
 the kind of reception which was to meet me in England 
 and Scotland. I had thought of something involving 
 considerable warmth, perhaps, and a good deal of cor 
 diality and feeling on the part of friends ; but of the 
 general extent of feeling through society, and of the 
 degree to which it would be publicly expressed, I had, 
 I may say, no conception. 
 
 As through your society I was invited to your coun 
 try, it may seem proper that what communication I have 
 to make to friends in England and Scotland should be 
 made through you. 
 
 In the first place, then, the question will probably 
 arise in your minds, Have the recent demonstrations in 
 Great Britain done good to the anti-slavery cause in 
 America ? 
 
 The first result of those demonstrations, as might 
 have been expected, was an intense reaction. Every 
 kind of false, evil, and malignant report has been circu 
 lated by malicious and partisan papers ; and if there is 
 

<page 288>
ABOLITIONISM MADE FASHIONABLE. 253 
 
 any blessing in having all manner of evil said against 
 us falsely, we have seemed to be in a fair way to come 
 in possession of it. 
 
 The sanction which was given in this matter to the 
 voice of the people, by the nobility of England and 
 Scotland, has been regarded and treated with special 
 rancor ; and yet, in its place, it has been particularly 
 important. Without it great advantages would have 
 been taken to depreciate the value of the national testi 
 mony. The value of this testimony in particular will 
 appear from the fact that the anti-slavery cause has 
 been treated with especial contempt by the leaders of 
 society in this country, and every attempt made to 
 brand it with ridicule. 
 
 The effect of making a cause generally unfashionable 
 is much greater in this world than it ought to be. It 
 operates very powerfully with the young and impressi 
 ble portion of the community ; therefore Cassius M. 
 Clay very well said with regard to the demonstration at 
 Stafford House : &quot; It will help our cause by rendering 
 it fashionable.&quot; 
 
 With regard to the present state of the anti-slavery 
 cause in America, I think, for many reasons, that it has 
 never been more encouraging. It is encouraging in 
 this respect, that the subject is now fairly up for in 
 quiry before the public mind. And that systematic 
 effort which has been made for years to prevent its 
 being discussed is proving wholly ineffectual. 
 
 The &quot; Key to Uncle Tom s Cabin &quot; has sold exten 
 sively at the South, following in the wake of &quot; Uncle 
 Tom.&quot; Not one fact or statement in it has been dis 
 proved as yet. I have yet to learn of even an attempt 
 to disprove. 
 

<page 289>
254 HOME AGAIN. 
 
 The &quot; North American Review,&quot; a periodical which 
 has never been favorable to the discussion of the slavery 
 question, has come out with a review of &quot; Uncle Tom s 
 Cabin/ in which, while rating the book very low as a 
 work of art, they account for its great circulation and 
 success by the fact of its being a true picture of slavery. 
 They go on to say that the system is one so inherently 
 abominable that, unless slaveholders shall rouse them 
 selves and abolish the principle of chattel ownership, 
 they can no longer sustain themselves under the con 
 tempt and indignation of the whole civilized world. 
 What are the slaveholders to do when this is the best 
 their friends and supporters can say for them ? 
 
 I regret to say that the movements of Christian de 
 nominations on this subject are yet greatly behind 
 what they should be. Some movements have been 
 made by religious bodies, of which I will not now 
 speak ; but as a general thing the professed Christian 
 church is pushed up to its duty by the world, rather 
 than the world urged on by the church. 
 
 The colored people in this country are rapidly rising 
 in every respect. I shall request Frederick Douglass 
 to send you the printed account of the recent colored 
 convention. It would do credit to any set of men 
 whatever, and I hope you will get some notice taken of 
 it in the papers of the United Kingdom. It is time 
 that the slanders against this unhappy race should be 
 refuted, and it should be seen how, in spite of every 
 social and political oppression, they are rising in the 
 scale of humanity. In my opinion they advance quite 
 as fast as any of the foreign races which have found 
 an asylum among us. 
 

<page 290>
THE KANSAS-NEBRASKA BILL. 255 
 
 May God so guide us in all things that our good be 
 not evil spoken of, and that we be left to defend noth 
 ing which is opposed to his glory and the good of 
 man ! Yours in all sympathy, 
 
 H. B. STOWE. 
 
 During the Kansas and Nebraska agitation (1853- 
 54), Mrs. Stowe, in common with the abolitionists of 
 the North, was deeply impressed with a solemn sense 
 that it was a desperate crisis in the nation s history. 
 She was in constant correspondence with Charles Sum- 
 ner and other distinguished statesmen of the time, and 
 kept herself informed as to the minutest details of the 
 struggle. At this time she wrote and caused to be 
 circulated broadcast the following appeal to the women 
 of America : 
 
 &quot; The Providence of God has brought our nation to 
 a crisis of most solemn interest. 
 
 &quot; A question is now pending in our national legisla 
 ture which is most vitally to affect the temporal and 
 eternal interests, not only of ourselves, but of our chil 
 dren and our children s children for ages yet unborn. 
 Through our nation it is to affect the interests of lib 
 erty and Christianity throughout the world. 
 
 &quot; Of the woes, the injustice, and the misery of slavery 
 it is not needful to speak. There is but one feeling 
 and one opinion upon this subject among us all. I do 
 not think there is a mother who clasps her child to her 
 breast who would ever be made to feel it right that 
 that child should be a slave, not a mother among us 
 who would not rather lay that child in its grave. 
 
 &quot; Nor can I believe that there is a woman so un- 
 

<page 291>
256 HOME AGAIN. 
 
 Christian as to think it right to inflict upon her neigh 
 bor s child what she would consider worse than death 
 were it inflicted upon her own. I do not believe there 
 is a wife who would think it right that her husband 
 should be sold to a trader to be worked all his life 
 without wages or a recognition of rights. I do not 
 believe there is a husband who would consider it right 
 that his wife should be regarded by law the property 
 of another man. I do not believe there is a father or 
 mother who would consider it right were they forbid 
 den by law to teach their children to read. I do not 
 believe there is a brother who would think it right to 
 have his sister held as property, with no legal defense 
 for her personal honor, by any man living. 
 
 &quot; All this is inherent in slavery. It is not the abuse 
 of slavery, but its legal nature. And there is not a 
 woman in the United States, where the question is fairly 
 put to her, who thinks these things are right. 
 
 &quot; But though our hearts have bled over this wrong, 
 there have been many things tending to fetter our 
 hands, to perplex our efforts, and to silence our voice. 
 We have been told that to speak of it was an invasion 
 of the rights of states. We have heard of promises 
 and compacts, and the natural expression of feeling has 
 in many cases been repressed by an appeal to those 
 honorable sentiments which respect the keeping of 
 engagements. 
 
 &quot; But a time has now come when the subject is aris 
 ing under quite a different aspect. 
 
 &quot; The question is not now, shall the wrongs of slavery 
 exist as they have within their own territories, but 
 shall we permit them to be extended all over the free 
 

<page 292>
THE MISSOURI COMPROMISE. 257 
 
 territories of the United States ? Shall the woes arid 
 the miseries of slavery be extended over a region of 
 fair, free, unoccupied territory nearly equal in extent 
 to the whole of the free States ? 
 
 &quot; Nor is this all ! This is not the last thing 1 that is 
 
 o 
 
 expected or intended. Should this movement be sub 
 mitted to in silence, should the North consent to this 
 solemn breach of contract on the part of the South, 
 there yet remains one more step to be apprehended, 
 namely, the legalizing of slavery throughout the free 
 States. By a decision of the supreme court in the 
 Lemmon case, it may be declared lawful for slave prop 
 erty to be held in the Northern States. Should this 
 come to pass, it is no more improbable that there may 
 be four years hence slave depots in New York city 
 than it was four years ago that the South would pro 
 pose a repeal of the Missouri Compromise. 
 
 &quot; Women of the free States ! the question is not 
 shall we remonstrate with slavery on its own soil, but 
 are we willing to receive slavery into the free States 
 and Territories of this Union ? Shall the whole power 
 of these United States go into the hands of slavery? 
 Shall every State in the Union be thrown open to 
 slavery ? This is the possible result and issue of the 
 question now pending. This is the fearful crisis at 
 which we stand. 
 
 &quot; And now you ask, What can the women of a coun 
 try do? 
 
 &quot; women of the free States ! what did your brave 
 mothers do in the days of our Revolution ? Did not 
 liberty in those days feel the strong impulse of woman s 
 heart ? 
 

<page 293>
258 HOME AGAIN. 
 
 &quot; There was never a great interest agitating a com 
 munity where woman s influence was not felt for 
 good or for evil. , At the time when the abolition of 
 the slave - trade was convulsing England, women con 
 tributed more than any other laborers to that great 
 triumph of humanity. The women of England refused 
 to receive into their houses the sugar raised by slaves. 
 Seventy thousand families thus refused the use of sugar 
 in testimony of their abhorrence of the manner in 
 which it was produced. At that time women were un 
 wearied in going from house to house distributing 
 books and tracts upon the subject, and presenting it 
 clearly and forcibly to thousands of families who would 
 otherwise have disregarded it. 
 
 &quot; The women all over England were associated in 
 corresponding circles for prayer and labor. Petitions 
 to the government were prepared and signed by women 
 of every station in all parts of the kingdom. 
 
 &quot; Women of America ! we do not know with what 
 thrilling earnestness the hopes and the eyes of the 
 world are fastened upon our country, and how intense 
 is the desire that we should take a stand for universal 
 liberty. When I was in England, although I distinctly 
 stated that the raising of money was no part of my ob 
 ject there, it was actually forced upon me by those who 
 could not resist the impulse to do something for this 
 great cause. Nor did it come from the well-to-do 
 alone ; but hundreds of most affecting letters were 
 received from poor working men and women, who in 
 closed small sums in postage-stamps to be devoted to 
 freeing slaves. 
 
 &quot; Nor is this deep feeling confined to England alone. 
 

<page 294>
EUROPE A WITNESS. 259 
 
 I found it in France, Switzerland, and Germany. Why 
 do foreign lands regard us with this intensity of in 
 terest ? Is it not because the whole world looks hope 
 fully toward America as a nation especially raised by 
 God to advance the cause of human liberty and re 
 ligion ? 
 
 &quot; There has been a universal expectation that the 
 next step taken by America would surely be one that 
 should have a tendency to right this great wrong. 
 Those who are struggling for civil and religious liberty 
 in Europe speak this word slavery in sad whispers, as 
 one names a fault of a revered friend. They can scarce 
 believe the advertisements in American papers of slave 
 sales of men, women, and children, traded like cattle. 
 Scarcely can they trust their eyes when they read the 
 laws of the slave States, and the decisions of their 
 courts. The advocates of despotism hold these things 
 up to them and say : See what comes of republican 
 liberty ! Hitherto the answer has been, ( America is 
 more than half free, and she certainly will in time 
 repudiate slavery altogether ^ x 
 
 &quot; But what can they say now if, just as the great 
 struggle for human rights is commencing throughout 
 Europe, America opens all her Territories to the most 
 unmitigated despotism ? 
 
 &quot; While all the nations of Europe are thus moved 
 on the subject of American slavery, shall we alone re 
 main unmoved? Shall we, the wives, mothers, and 
 sisters of America, remain content with inaction in such 
 a crisis as this ? 
 
 &quot; The first duty of every American woman at this 
 time is to thoroughly understand the subject for her- 
 

<page 295>
260 HOME AGAIN. 
 
 self, and to feel that she is bound to use her influence 
 for the right. Then they can obtain signatures to 
 petitions to our national legislature. They can spread 
 information upon this vital topic throughout their 
 neighborhoods. They can employ lecturers to lay the 
 subject before the people. They can circulate the 
 speeches of their members of Congress that bear upon 
 the subject, and in many other ways they can secure to 
 all a full understanding of the present position of our 
 country. 
 
 &quot; Above all, it seems to be necessary and desirable 
 that we should make this subject a matter of earnest 
 prayer. A conflict is now begun between the forces 
 of liberty and despotism throughout the whole world. 
 We who are Christians, and believe in the sure word 
 of prophecy, know that fearful convulsions and over- 
 turnings are predicted before the coming of Him who 
 is to rule the earth in righteousness. How important, 
 then, in this crisis, that all who believe in prayer should 
 retreat beneath the shadow of the Almighty ! 
 
 &quot; It is a melancholy but unavoidable result of such 
 great encounters of principle that they tend to de 
 generate into sectional and personal bitterness. It is 
 this liability that forms one of the most solemn and 
 affecting features of the crisis now presented. We are 
 on the eve of a conflict which will try men s souls, and 
 strain to the utmost the bonds of brotherly union that 
 bind this nation together. 
 
 &quot; Let us, then, pray that in the agitation of this ques 
 tion between the North and the South the war of prin 
 ciple may not become a mere sectional conflict, degen 
 erating into the encounter of physical force. Let us 
 

<page 296>
CORRESPONDENCE WITH GARRISON. 261 
 
 raise our hearts to Him who has the power to restrain 
 the wrath of men, that He will avert the consequences 
 that our sins as a nation so justly deserve. 
 
 &quot; There are many noble minds in the South who do 
 not participate in the machinations of their political 
 leaders, and whose sense of honor and justice is out 
 raged by this proposition equally with our own. While, 
 then, we seek to sustain the cause of freedom unwaver 
 ingly, let us also hold it to be our office as true women 
 to moderate the acrimony of political contest, remem 
 bering that the slaveholder and the slave are alike our 
 brethren, whom the law of God commands us to love as 
 ourselves. 
 
 &quot; For the sake, then, of our dear children, for the 
 sake of our common country, for the sake of outraged 
 and struggling liberty throughout the world, let every 
 woman of America now do her duty.&quot; 
 
 At this same time Mrs. Stowe found herself engaged 
 in an active correspondence with William Lloyd Garri 
 son, much of which appeared in the columns of his 
 paper, the &quot; Liberator.&quot; Late in 1853 she writes to 
 him : 
 
 &quot; In regard to you, your paper, and in some meas 
 ure your party, I am in an honest embarrassment. I 
 sympathize with you fully in many of your positions. 
 Others I consider erroneous, hurtful to liberty and the 
 progress of humanity. Nevertheless, I believe you and 
 those who support them to be honest and conscientious 
 in your course and opinions. What I fear is that your 
 paper wiU take from poor Uncle Tom his Bible, and 
 give him nothing in its place.&quot; 
 
 To this Mr. Garrison answers : &quot; I do not understand 
 

<page 297>
262 HOME AGAIN. 
 
 why the imputation is thrown upon the Liberator as 
 tending to rob Uncle Tom of his Bible. I know of 
 no writer in its pages who wishes to deprive him of it, 
 or of any comfort he may derive from it. It is for him 
 to place whatever estimate he can upon it, and for you 
 and me to do the same ; but for neither of us to accept 
 any more of it than we sincerely believe to be in accord 
 ance with reason, truth, and eternal right. How much 
 of it is true and obligatory, each one can determine 
 only for himself; for on Protestant ground there is no 
 room for papal infallibility. AU Christendom professes 
 to believe in the inspiration of the volume, and at the 
 same time all Christendom is by the ears as to its real 
 teachings. Surely you would not have me disloyal to 
 my conscience. How do you prove that you are not 
 trammeled by educational or traditional notions as to 
 the entire sanctity of the book? Indeed, it seems to 
 me very evident that you are not free in spirit, in view 
 of the apprehension and sorrow you feel because you 
 find your conceptions of the Bible controverted in the 
 Liberator, else why such disquietude of mind ? 
 Thrice is he armed who hath his quarrel just. ! 
 In answer to this Mrs. Stowe writes : 
 
 I did not reply to your letter immediately, because I 
 did not wish to speak on so important a subject unad 
 visedly, or without proper thought and reflection. The 
 greater the interest involved in a truth the more care 
 ful, self-distrustful, and patient should be the inquiry. 
 
 I would not attack the faith of a heathen without 
 being sure I had a better one to put in its place, be 
 cause, such as it is, it is better than nothing. I notice 
 

<page 298>
THE LIBERATOR AND THE BIBLE. 263 
 
 in Mr. Parker s sermons a very eloquent passage on the 
 uses and influences of the Bible. He considers it to 
 embody absolute and perfect religion, and that no bet 
 ter mode for securing present and eternal happiness can 
 be found than in the obedience to certain religious pre 
 cepts therein recorded. He would have it read and 
 circulated, and considers it, as I infer, a Christian duty 
 to send it to the heathen, the slave, etc. I presume 
 you agree with him. 
 
 These things being supposed about the Bible would 
 certainly make it appear that, if any man deems it his 
 duty to lessen its standing in the eyes of the commu 
 nity, he ought at least to do so in a cautious and rever 
 ential spirit, with humility and prayer. 
 
 My objection to the mode in which these things are 
 handled in the &quot; Liberator &quot; is that the general tone 
 and spirit seem to me the reverse of this. If your 
 paper circulated only among those of disciplined and 
 cultivated minds, skilled to separate truth from false 
 hood, knowing where to go for evidence and how to 
 satisfy the doubts you raise, I should feel less regret. 
 But your name and benevolent labors have given your 
 paper a circulation among the poor and lowly. They 
 have no means of investigating, no habits of reasoning. 
 The Bible, as they at present understand it, is doing 
 them great good, and is a blessing to them and their 
 families. The whole tendency of your mode of pro 
 ceeding is to lessen their respect and reverence for the 
 Bible, without giving them anything in its place. 
 /i have no fear of discussion as to its final results on 
 the Bible ; my only regrets are for those human beings 
 whose present and immortal interests I think compro- 
 

<page 299>
264 HOME AGAIN. 
 
 mised by this manner of discussion. Discussion of the 
 evidence of the authenticity and inspiration of the 
 Bible and of all theology will come more and more, 
 and I rejoice that they will. But I think they must 
 come, as all successful inquiries into truth must, in a 
 calm, thoughtful, and humble spirit ; not with bold 
 assertions, hasty generalizations, or passionate appeals. 
 
 I appreciate your good qualities none the less though 
 you differ with me on this point. I believe you to be 
 honest and sincere. In Mr. Parker s works I have 
 found much to increase my respect and esteem for him 
 as a man. He comes to results, it is true, to which it 
 would be death and utter despair for me to arrive at. 
 Did I believe as he does about the Bible and Jesus, I 
 were of all creatures most miserable, because I could 
 not love God. I could find no God to love. I would 
 far rather never have been born. 
 
 As to you, my dear friend, you must own that my 
 frankness to you is the best expression of my confi 
 dence in your honor and nobleness. Did I not believe 
 that &quot; an excellent spirit &quot; is in you, I would not take 
 the trouble to write all this. If in any points in this 
 note I appear to have misapprehended or done you in 
 justice, I hope you will candidly let me know where and 
 how. Truly your friend, 
 
 H. B. STOWE. 
 
 In addition to these letters the following extracts 
 from a subsequent letter to Mr. Garrison are given to 
 show in what respect their fields of labor differed, and 
 to present an idea of what Mrs. Stowe was doing for 
 the cause of freedom besides writing against slavery :

AROUSING THE CHURCH. 265 
 
 ANDOVER, MASS., February 18, 1854. 
 
 DEAR FRIEND, I see and sincerely rejoice in the 
 result of your lecture in New York. I am increasingly 
 anxious that all who hate slavery be united, if not in 
 form, at least in fact, a unity in difference. Our 
 field lies in the church, and as yet I differ from you as 
 to what may be done and hoped there. Brother Ed 
 ward (Beecher) has written a sermon that goes to the 
 very root of the decline of moral feeling in the church. 
 As soon as it can be got ready for the press I shall 
 have it printed, and shall send a copy to every minister 
 in the country. 
 
 Our lectures have been somewhat embarrassed by a 
 pressure of new business brought upon us by the 
 urgency of the Kansas-Nebraska question. Since we 
 began, however, brother Edward has devoted his whole 
 time to visiting, consultation, and efforts the result of 
 which will shortly be given to the public. We are try 
 ing to secure a universal arousing of the pulpit. 
 
 Dr. Bacon s letter is noble. You must think so. It 
 has been sent to every member of Congress. Dr. 
 Kirk s sermon is an advance, and his congregation 
 warmly seconded it. Now, my good friend, be willing 
 to see that the church is better than you have thought 
 it. Be not unwilling to see some good symptoms, and 
 hope that even those who see not at all at first will 
 gain as they go on. I am acting on the conviction 
 that you love the cause better than self. If anything 
 can be done now advantageously by the aid of money, 
 let me know. God has given me some power in this 
 way, though I am too feeble to do much otherwise. 
 Yours for the cause, H. B. STOWB. 
 

<page 303>
266 HOME AGAIN. 
 
 Although the demand was very great upon Mrs. 
 Stowe for magazine and newspaper articles, many of 
 which she managed to write in 1854-55, she had in 
 her mind at this time a new book which should be 
 in many respects the complement of &quot; Uncle Tom s 
 Cabin.&quot; In preparing her Key to the latter work, she 
 had collected much new material. In 1855, therefore, 
 and during the spring of 1856, she found time to 
 weave these hitherto unused facts into the story of 
 &quot; Dred.&quot; In her preface to the English edition of this 
 book she writes : 
 
 &quot; The author s object in this book is to show the gen 
 eral effect of slavery on society ; the various social dis 
 advantages which it brings, even to its most favored 
 advocates; the shiftlessness and misery and backward 
 tendency of all the economical arrangements of slave 
 States ; the retrograding of good families into poverty ; 
 the deterioration of land ; the worse demoralization of 
 all classes, from the aristocratic, tyrannical planter to 
 the oppressed and poor white, which is the result of the 
 introduction of slave labor. 
 
 &quot; It is also an object to display the corruption of 
 Christianity which arises from the same source ; a cor 
 ruption that has gradually lowered the standard of the 
 church, North and South, and been productive of more 
 infidelity than the works of all the encyclopaedists put 
 together.&quot; 
 
 The story of &quot; Dred &quot; was suggested by the famous 
 negro insurrection, led by Nat Turner, in Eastern Vir 
 ginia in 1831. In this affair one of the principal par 
 ticipators was named &quot; Dred.&quot; An interesting incident 
 connected with the writing of &quot; Dred &quot; is vividly remem 
 bered by Mrs. Stowe s daughters. 
 

<page 304>
A THUNDER-STORM. 267 
 
 One sultry summer night there arose a terrific thun 
 der-storm, with continuous flashes of lightning and 
 incessant rumbling and muttering of thunder, every 
 now and then breaking out into sharp, crashing reports 
 followed by torrents of rain. 
 
 The two young girls, trembling with fear, groped 
 their way down-stairs to their mother s room, and on 
 entering found her lying quietly in bed awake, and 
 calmly watching the storm from the windows, the shades 
 being up. She expressed no surprise on seeing them, 
 but said that she had not been herself in the least 
 frightened, though intensely interested in watching the 
 storm. &quot; I have been writing a description of a thun 
 der-storm for my book, and I am watching to see if I 
 need to correct it in any particular.&quot; Our readers will 
 be interested to know that she had so well described a 
 storm from memory that even this vivid object-lesson 
 brought with it no new suggestions. This scene is to 
 be found in the twenty-fourth chapter of &quot; Dred,&quot; 
 &quot; Life in the Swamps.&quot; 
 
 &quot; The day had been sultry and it was now an hour 
 or two past midnight, when a thunder-storm, which had 
 long been gathering and muttering in the distant sky, 
 began to develop its forces. A low, shivering sigh 
 crept through the woods, and swayed in weird whist 
 lings the tops of the pines ; and sharp arrows of light 
 ning came glittering down among the branches, as if 
 sent from the bow of some warlike angel. An army 
 of heavy clouds swept in a moment across the moon ; 
 then came a broad, dazzling, blinding sheet of flame.&quot; 
 
 What particularly impressed Mrs. Stowe s daughters 
 at the tune was their mother s perfect calmness, and the 
 

<page 305>
268 HOME AGAIN. 
 
 minute study of the storm. She was on the alert to 
 detect anything which might lead her to correct her 
 description. 
 
 Of this new story Charles Summer wrote from the 
 senate chamber : 
 
 MY DEAR MRS. STOWE, I am rejoiced to learn, 
 from your excellent sister here, that you are occupied 
 with another tale exposing slavery. I feel that it will 
 act directly upon pending questions, and help us in our 
 struggle for Kansas, and also to overthrow the slave- 
 oligarchy in the coming Presidential election. We 
 need your help at once in our struggle. 
 
 Ever sincerely yours, CHARLES SUMNER. 
 
 Having finished this second great story of slavery, in 
 the early summer of 1856 Mrs. Stowe decided to visit 
 Europe again, in search of a much-needed rest. She 
 also found it necessary to do so in order to secure the 
 English right to her book, which she had failed to do 
 on &quot; Uncle Tom s Cabin.&quot; 
 
 Just before sailing she received the following touch 
 ing letter from her life-long friend, Georgiana May. 
 It is the last one of a series that extended without 
 interruption over a period of thirty years, and as such 
 has been carefully cherished : 
 
 OCEAN HOUSE, GROTON POINT, July 26, 1856. 
 
 DEAR HATTIE, Very likely it is too late for me to 
 come with my modest knock to your study door, and 
 ask to be taken in for a moment, but I do so want to 
 bless you before you go, and I have not been well 
 enough to write until to-day. It seems just as if I 
 

<page 306>
LETTER FROM AN OLD FRIEND. 269 
 
 could not let you go till I have seen once more your 
 face in the flesh, for great uncertainties hang over my 
 future. One thing, however, is certain : whichever of 
 us two gets first to the farther shore of the great ocean 
 between us and the unseen will be pretty sure to be at 
 hand to welcome the other. It is not poetry, but sol 
 emn verity between us that we shall meet again. 
 
 But there is nothing morbid or morbific going into 
 these few lines. I have made &quot; Old Tiff s &quot; acquaint 
 ance, fie is a verity, will stand up with Uncle Tom 
 and Topsy, pieces of negro property you will be guilty 
 of holding after you are dead. Very likely your chil 
 dren may be selling them. 
 
 Hattie, I rejoice over this completed work. Another 
 work for God and your generation. I am glad that 
 you have come out of it alive, that you have pleasure 
 in prospect, that you &quot; walk at liberty &quot; and have done 
 with &quot; fits of languishing.&quot; Perhaps some day I shall 
 be set free, but the prospect does not look promising, 
 except as I have full faith that &quot; the Good Man above 
 is looking on, and will bring it all round right.&quot; Still 
 &quot; heart and flesh &quot; both &quot; fail me.&quot; He will be the 
 &quot; strength of my heart,&quot; and I never seem to doubt 
 &quot; my portion forever.&quot; 
 
 If I never speak to you again, this is the farewell 
 utterance. Yours truly, 
 
 GEORGIANA. 
 
 Mrs. Stowe was accompanied on this second trip to 
 Europe by her husband, her two eldest daughters, her 
 son Henry, and her sister Mary (Mrs. Perkins). It 
 was a pleasant summer voyage, and was safely accom 
 plished without special incident.

 DRED, 1856. 
 
 SECOND VISIT TO ENGLAND. A GLIMPSE AT THE QUEEN. THE 
 DUKE OF ARGYLL AND INVERARY. EARLY CORRESPONDENCE WITH 
 LADY BYRON. DUNROBIN CASTLE AND ITS INMATES. A VISIT 
 TO STOKE PARK. LORD DUFFERIN. CHARLES KINGSLEY AT 
 HOME. PARIS REVISITED. MADAME MOHL S RECEPTIONS. 
 
 AFTER reaching England, about the middle of Au 
 gust, 1856, Mrs. Stowe and her husband spent some 
 days in London completing arrangements to have an 
 English edition of &quot; Dred &quot; published by Sampson 
 Low & Co. Professor Stowe s duties in America being 
 very pressing, he had intended returning at once, but 
 was detained for a short time, as will be seen in the 
 following letter written by him from Glasgow, August 
 29, to a friend in America : 
 
 DEAR FRIEND, I finished my business in London 
 on Wednesday, and intended to return by the Liver 
 pool steamer of to-morrow, but find that every berth 
 on that line is engaged until the 3d of October. We 
 therefore came here yesterday, and I shall take passage 
 in the steamer New York from this port next Tuesday. 
 We have received a special invitation to visit Inverary 
 Castle, the seat of the Duke of Argyll, and yesterday 
 we had just the very pleasantest little interview with 
 the Queen that ever was. None of the formal, draw- 
 

<page 308>
A GLIMPSE OF THE QUEEN. 271 
 
 ing-room, breathless receptions, but just an accidental, 
 done-on-purpose meeting at a railway station, while on 
 our way to Scotland. 
 
 The Queen seemed really delighted to see my wife, 
 and remarkably glad to see me for her sake. She 
 pointed us out to Prince Albert, who made two most 
 gracious bows to my wife and two to me, while the four 
 royal children stared their big blue eyes almost out 
 looking at the little authoress of &quot; Uncle Tom s Cabin.&quot; 
 Colonel Grey handed the Queen, with my wife s compli 
 ments, a copy of the new book (&quot; Dred &quot;). She took one 
 volume herself and handed the other to Prince Albert, 
 and they were soon both very busy reading. She is a 
 real nice little body with exceedingly pleasant, kindly 
 manners. 
 
 I expect to be in Natick the last week in September. 
 God bless you all. 
 
 C. E. STOWE. 
 
 After her husband s departure for the United States, 
 Mrs. Stowe, with her son Henry, her two eldest daugh 
 ters, and her sister Mary (Mrs. Perkins), accepted the 
 Duke of Argyll s invitation to visit the Highlands. Of 
 this visit we catch a pleasant glimpse from a letter writ 
 ten to Professor Stowe during its continuance, which is 
 as follows : 
 
 INVERARY CASTLE, September 6, 1856. 
 
 MY DEAR HUSBAND, We have been now a week 
 in this delicious place, enjoying the finest skies and 
 scenery, the utmost of kind hospitality. From Loch 
 Goil we took the coach for Inverary, a beautiful drive 
 

<page 309>
272 DEED. 
 
 of about two hours. We had seats on the outside, and 
 the driver John, like some of the White Mountain guides, 
 was full of song and story, and local tradition. He 
 spoke Scotch and Gaelic, recited ballads, and sung songs 
 with great gusto. Mary and the girls stopped in a little 
 inn at St. Catherine s, on the shores of Loch Fine, while 
 Henry and I took steamboat for Inverary, where we 
 found the duchess waiting in a carriage for us, with 
 Lady Emma Campbell. . . . 
 
 The common routine of the day here is as follows : 
 We rise about half past -eight. About half past nine 
 we all meet in the dining-hall, where the servants are 
 standing in a line down one side, and a row of chairs 
 for guests and visitors occupies the other. The duchess 
 with her nine children, a perfectly beautiful little flock, 
 sit together. The duke reads the Bible and a prayer, 
 and pronounces the benediction. After that, breakfast 
 is served, a very hearty, informal, cheerful meal, 
 and after that come walks, or drives, or fishing parties, 
 till lunch time, and then more drives, or anything else : 
 everybody, in short, doing what he likes till half past 
 seven, which is the dinner hour. After that we have 
 coffee and tea in the evening. 
 
 The first morning, the duke took me to see his mine 
 of nickel silver. We had a long and beautiful drive, 
 and talked about everything in literature, religion, 
 morals, and the temperance movement, about which last 
 he is in some state of doubt and uncertainty, not in 
 clining, I think, to have it pressed yet, though feeling 
 there is need of doing something. 
 
 If &quot; Dred &quot; has as good a sale in America as it is 
 likely to have in England, we shall do well. There is 
 

<page 310>
AT INVERARY CASTLE. 273 
 
 such a demand that they had to placard the shop win 
 dows in Glasgow with, 
 
 &quot; To prevent disappointment, 
 
 Dred 
 Not to be had till,&quot; etc. 
 
 Everybody is after it, and the prospect is of an enor 
 mous sale. 
 
 ^God, to whom I prayed night and day while I was 
 writing the book, has heard me, and given us of worldly 
 goods more than I asked. I feel, therefore, a desire to ( 
 &quot; walk softly,&quot; and inquire, for what has He so trusted 
 us? 
 
 Every day I am more charmed with the duke and 
 duchess ; they are simple-hearted, frank, natural, full 
 of feeling, of piety, and good sense. They certainly 
 are, apart from any considerations of rank or position, 
 most interesting and noble people. The duke laughed 
 heartily at many things I told him of our Andover 
 theological tactics, of your preaching, etc. ; but I think 
 he is a sincere, earnest Christian. 
 
 Our American politics form the daily topic of in 
 terest. The late movements in Congress are discussed 
 with great warmth, and every morning the papers are 
 watched for new details. 
 
 I must stop now, as it is late and we are to leave 
 here early to-morrow morning. We are going to Staffa, 
 lona, the Pass of Glencoe, and finally through the Cal 
 edonian Canal up to Dunrobin Castle, where a large 
 party of all sorts of interesting people are gathered 
 around the Duchess of Sutherland. 
 
 Affectionately yours, HARRIET. 
 

<page 311>
274 DEED. 
 
 From Dunrobin Castle one of his daughters writes 
 
 o 
 
 to Professor Stowe : &quot; We spent five most delightful 
 days at Inverary, and were so sorry you could not be 
 there with us. From there we went to Oban, and spent 
 several days sight-seeing, finally reaching Inverness by 
 way of the Caledonian Canal. Here, to our surprise, 
 we found our rooms at the hotel all prepared for us. 
 The next morning we left by post for Dunrobin, which 
 is fifty-nine miles from Inverness. At the borders of 
 the duke s estate we found a delightfully comfortable 
 carriage awaiting us, and before we had gone much 
 farther the postilion announced that the duchess was 
 coming to meet us. Sure enough, as we looked up the 
 road we saw a fine cavalcade approaching. It consisted 
 of a splendid coach-and-four (in which sat the duchess) 
 with liveried postilions, and a number of outriders, one 
 of whom rode in front to clear the way. The duchess 
 seemed perfectly delighted to see mamma, and taking 
 her into her own carriage dashed off towards the castle, 
 we following on behind.&quot; 
 
 At Dunrobin Mrs. Stowe found awaiting her the fol 
 lowing note from her friend, Lady Byron : 
 
 LONDON, September 10, 1856. 
 
 Your book, dear Mrs. Stowe, is of the &quot; little leaven &quot; 
 kind, and must prove a great moral force, perhaps not 
 manifestly so much as secretly, and yet I can hardly 
 conceive so much power without immediate and sensible 
 effects ; only there will be a strong disposition to resist 
 on the part of all the hollow-hearted professors of 
 religion, whose heathenisms you so unsparingly expose. 
 They have a class feeling like others. To the young, 
 

<page 312>
NOTE FROM LADY BYRON. 275 
 
 and to those who do not reflect much on what is offered 
 to their belief, you will do great good by showing how 
 spiritual food is adulterated. The Bread from Heaven 
 is in the same case as baker s bread. I feel that one 
 perusal is not enough. It is a &quot; mine/ to use your own 
 simile. If there is truth in what I heard Lord Byron 
 say, that works of fiction lived only by the amount of 
 truth which they contained, your story is sure of long 
 life. . . . 
 
 I know now, more than before, how to value com 
 munion with you. 
 
 With kind regards to your family, 
 Yours affectionately, 
 
 A. T. NOEL BYRON. 
 
 From this pleasant abiding-place Mrs. Stowe writes 
 to her husband : 
 
 DUNROBIN CASTLE, September 15, 1856. 
 
 MY DEAR HUSBAND, Everything here is like a 
 fairy story. The place is beautiful ! It is the most 
 perfect combination of architectural and poetic romance, 
 with home comfort. The people, too, are charming. We 
 have here Mr. Labouchere, a cabinet minister, and Lady 
 Mary his wife, I like him very much, and her, too, 
 Kingsley s brother, a very entertaining man, and to 
 morrow Lord Ellsmere is expected. I wish you could 
 be here, for I am sure you would like it. Life is so 
 quiet and sincere and friendly, that you would feel more 
 as if you had come at the hearts of these people than 
 in London. 
 
 The Sutherland estate looks like a garden. We 
 stopped at the town of Frain, four miles before we 
 

<page 313>
276 DRED. 
 
 reached Sutherlandshire, where a crowd of well-to-do, 
 nice-looking people gathered around the carriage, and 
 as we drove off gave three cheers. This was better 
 than I expected, and looks well for their opinion of my 
 views. 
 
 &quot; Dred &quot; is selling over here wonderfully. Low says, 
 with all the means at his command, he has not been able 
 to meet the demand. He sold fifty thousand in two 
 weeks, and probably will sell as many more. 
 
 I am showered with letters, private and printed, in 
 which the only difficulty is to know what the writers 
 would be at. I see evidently happiness and prosperity 
 all through the line of this estate. I see the duke 
 giving his thought and time, and spending the whole 
 income of this estate in improvements upon it. I see 
 the duke and duchess evidently beloved wherever they 
 move. I see them most amiable, most Christian, most 
 considerate to everybody. The writers of the letters 
 admit the goodness of the duke, but denounce the sys 
 tem, and beg me to observe its effects for myself. I do 
 observe that, compared with any other part of the High 
 lands, Sutherland is a garden. I observe well -clothed 
 people, thriving lands, healthy children, fine school- 
 houses, and all that. 
 
 Henry was invited to the tenants dinner, where he 
 excited much amusement by pledging every toast in 
 fair water, as he has done invariably on all occasions 
 since he has been here. 
 
 The duchess, last night, showed me her copy of 
 &quot; Dred,&quot; in which she has marked what most struck or 
 pleased her. I begged it, and am going to send it to 
 you. She said to me this morning at breakfast, &quot; The 
 

<page 314>
DEPARTURE FROM DUNROBIN. 277 
 
 Queen says that she began Died the very minute she 
 got it, and is deeply interested in it.&quot; 
 
 She bought a copy of Lowell s poems, and begged 
 me to mark the best ones for her ; so if you see him, 
 tell him that we have been reading him together. She 
 is, taking her all in all, one of the noblest-appointed 
 women I ever saw ; real old, genuine English, such as 
 one reads of in history ; full of nobility, courage, ten 
 derness, and zeal. It does me good to hear her read 
 prayers daily, as she does, in the midst of her servants 
 and guests, with a manner full of grand and noble feel 
 ing. 
 
 Thursday Morning, September 25. We were 
 obliged to get up at half past five the morning we 
 left Dunrobin, an effort when one does n t go to bed 
 till one o clock. We found breakfast laid for us in the 
 library, and before we had quite finished the duchess 
 came in. Our starting off was quite an imposing sight. 
 First came the duke s landau, in which were Mary, the 
 duke, and myself ; then a carriage in which were Eliza 
 and Hatty, and finally the carriage which we had hired, 
 with Henry, our baggage, and Mr. Jackson (the duke s 
 secretary). The gardener sent a fresh bouquet for 
 each of us, and there was such a leave-taking, as if we 
 were old and dear friends. We did really love them, and 
 had no doubt of their love for us. 
 
 The duke rode with us as far as Dornach, where he 
 showed us the cathedral beneath which his ancestors 
 are buried, and where is a statue of his father, similar 
 to one the tenants have erected on top of the highest 
 hill in the neighborhood. 
 
 We also saw the prison, which had but two inmates, 
 

<page 315>
278 DRED. 
 
 and the old castle. Here the duke took leave of us, 
 and taking our own carriage we crossed the ferry and 
 continued on our way. After a very bad night s rest 
 at Inverness, in consequence of the town s being so full 
 of people attending some Highland games that we 
 could have no places at the hotel, and after a weary 
 ride in the rain, we came into Aberdeen Friday night. 
 
 To-morrow we go on to Edinburgh, where I hope to 
 meet a letter from you. The last I heard from Low, 
 he had sold sixty thousand of &quot; Dred,&quot; and it was still 
 selling well. I have not yet heard from America how 
 it goes. The critics scold, and whiffle, and dispute 
 about it, but on the whole it is a success, so the 
 &quot; Times &quot; says, with much coughing, hemming, and 
 standing first on one foot and then on the other. If 
 the &quot; Times &quot; were sure we should beat in the next 
 election, &quot; Dred &quot; would go up in the scale ; but as long 
 as there is that uncertainty, it has first one line of 
 praise, and then one of blame. 
 
 Henry Stowe returned to America in October to en 
 ter Dartmouth College, while the rest of the party pur 
 sued their way southward, as will be seen by the follow 
 ing letters : 
 
 CITY OF YORK, October 10, 1856. 
 
 DEAR HUSBAND, Henry will tell you all about our 
 journey, and at present I have but little time for de 
 tails. I received your first letter with great joy, relief, 
 and gratitude, first to God for restoring your health 
 and strength, and then to you for so good, long, and 
 refreshing a letter. 
 
 Henry, I hope, comes Jiome with a serious determina- 
 

<page 316>
AN ENORMOUS SALE. 279 
 
 tion to do well and be a comfort. Seldom has a young 
 man seen what he has in this journey, or made more 
 valuable friends. 
 
 Since we left Aberdeen, from which place my last 
 was mailed, we have visited in Edinburgh with abound 
 ing delight; thence yesterday to Newcastle. Last 
 night attended service in Durham Cathedral, and after 
 that came to York, whence we send Henry to Liver 
 pool. 
 
 I send you letters, etc., by him. One hundred thou 
 sand copies of &quot;Dred&quot; sold in four weeks ! After that 
 who cares what critics say? Its success in England 
 has been complete, so far as sale is concerned. It is 
 very bitterly attacked, both from a literary and a reli 
 gious point of view. The &quot; Record &quot; is down upon it 
 with a cartload of solemnity ; the &quot; Athenaeum &quot; with 
 waspish spite ; the &quot; Edinburgh &quot; goes out of its way 
 to say that the author knows nothing of the society she 
 describes ; but yet it goes everywhere, is read every 
 where, and Mr. Low says that he puts the hundred and 
 twenty-fifth thousand to press confidently. The fact 
 that so many good judges like it better than &quot; Uncle 
 Tom &quot; is success enough. 
 
 In my journal to Henry, which you may look for 
 next week, you will learn how I have been very near 
 the Queen, and formed acquaintance with divers of 
 her lords and ladies, and heard all she has said about 
 &quot; Dred ; &quot; how she prefers it to &quot; Uncle Tom,&quot; how she 
 inquired for you, and other matters. 
 
 Till then, I am, as ever, your affectionate wife, 
 
 H. B. STOWE. 
 

<page 317>
280 DRED. 
 
 After leaving York, Mrs. Stowe and her party spent 
 a day or two at Carlton Rectory, on the edge of Sher 
 wood Forest, in which they enjoyed a most delightful 
 picnic. From there they were to travel to London by 
 way of Warwick and Oxford, and of this journey Mrs. 
 Stowe writes as follows to her son Henry : 
 
 &quot; The next morning we were induced to send our 
 things to London, being assured by Mr. G. that he 
 would dispatch them immediately with some things of 
 his own that were going, and that they should certainly 
 await us upon our arrival. In one respect it was well 
 for us that we thus rid ourselves of the trouble of look 
 ing after them, for I never saw such blind, confusing 
 arrangements as these English railroads have. 
 
 &quot; When we were set down at the place where we 
 were to change for Warwick, we were informed that 
 
 O 7 
 
 probably the train had gone. At any rate it could 
 only be found on the other side of the station. You 
 might naturally think we had nothing to do but walk 
 across to the other side. No, indeed ! We had to as 
 cend a flight of stairs, go through a sort of tubular 
 bridge, and down another pair of stairs. When we got 
 there the guard said the train was just about to start, 
 and yet the ticket office was closed. We tried the door 
 in vain. You must hurry/ said the guard. How 
 can we ? said I, when we can t get tickets/ He went 
 and thumped, and at last roused the dormant intelli 
 gence inside. We got our tickets, ran for dear life, 
 got in, and then waited ten minutes ! Arrived at 
 Warwick we had a very charming time, and after seeing 
 all there was to see we took cars for Oxford. 
 
 &quot;The next day we tried to see Oxford. You can 
 

<page 318>
AT ME. LOW S. 281 
 
 have no idea of it. Call it a college ! it is a city of 
 colleges, a mountain of museums, colleges, halls, 
 courts, parks, chapels, lecture-rooms. Out of twenty- 
 four colleges we saw only three. We saw enough, how 
 ever, to show us that to explore the colleges of Oxford 
 would take a week. Then we came away, and about 
 eleven o clock at night found ourselves in London. 
 
 &quot; It was dripping and raining here, for all the world, 
 just as it did when we left ; but we found a cosy little 
 parlor, papered with cheerful crimson paper, lighted by 
 a coal-fire, a neat little supper laid out, and the Misses 
 Low waiting for us. Was n t it nice ? 
 
 o 
 
 &quot; We are expecting our baggage to-night. Called at 
 Sampson Low s store to-day and found it full every 
 where of red &amp;lt; Dreds. 
 
 Upon reaching London Mrs. Stowe found the follow 
 ing note from Lady Byron awaiting her : 
 
 OXFORD HOUSE, October 15, 1856. 
 
 DEAR MRS. STOWE, The newspapers represent 
 you as returning to London, but I cannot wait for the 
 chance, slender I fear, of seeing you there, for I wish 
 to consult you on a point admitting but of little delay. 
 Feeling that the sufferers in Kansas have a claim not 
 only to sympathy, but to the expression of it, I wish to 
 send them a donation. It is, however, necessary to 
 know what is the best application of money and what 
 the safest channel. Presuming that you will approve 
 the object, I ask you to tell me. Perhaps you would 
 undertake the transmission of my &amp;lt;50. My present 
 residence, two miles beyond Richmond, is opposite. I 
 have watched for instructions of your course with warm 
 

<page 319>
282 DEED. 
 
 interest. The sale of your book will go on increasing. 
 It is beginning to be understood. 
 
 Believe me, with kind regards to your daughters, 
 Your faithful and affectionate 
 
 A. T. NOEL BYRON. 
 
 To this note the following answer was promptly re 
 turned : 
 
 GROVE TERRACE, KENTISH TOWN, October 16, 1856. 
 
 DEAR LADY BYRON, How glad I was to see your 
 handwriting once more ! how more than glad I should 
 be to see you ! I do long to see you. I have so much 
 to say, so much to ask, and need to be refreshed with 
 a sense of a congenial and sympathetic soul. 
 
 Thank you, my dear friend, for your sympathy with 
 our poor sufferers in Kansas. May God bless you for 
 it ! By doing this you will step to my side ; perhaps 
 you may share something of that abuse which they 
 who &quot; know not what they do &quot; heap upon all who so 
 feel for the right. I asssure you, dear friend, I am 
 not insensible to the fiery darts which thus fly around 
 me. ... 
 
 Direct as usual to my publishers, and believe me, as 
 ever, with all my heart, 
 
 Affectionately yours, H. B. S. 
 
 Having dispatched this note, Mrs. Stowe wrote to her 
 husband concerning their surroundings and plans as 
 follows : 
 
 &quot; Friday, 16th. Confusion in the camp ! no baggage 
 come, nobody knows why ; running to stations, inquir 
 ies, messages, and no baggage. Meanwhile we have 
 

<page 320>
STOKE PARK. 283 
 
 not even a clean collar, nothing but very soiled travel 
 ing dresses ; while Lady Mary Labouchere writes that 
 her carriage will wait for us at Slough Station this 
 afternoon, and we must be off at two. What s to be 
 done ? Luckily I did not carry all my dresses to Dunro- 
 bin ; so I, of all the party, have&quot; a dress that can be 
 worn. We go out and buy collars and handkerchiefs, 
 and two o clock beholds us at the station house. 
 
 &quot; Stoke Park. I arrived here alone, the baggage 
 not having yet been heard from. Mr. G., being found 
 in London, confessed that he delayed sending it by the 
 proper train. In short, Mr. G. is what is called an easy 
 man, and one whose easiness makes everybody else un 
 easy. So because he was easy and thought it was no 
 great matter, and things would turn out well enough, 
 without any great care, we have had all this discomfort. 
 
 &quot; I arrived alone at the Slough Station and found 
 Lady Mary s carriage waiting. Away we drove through 
 a beautiful park full of deer, who were so tame as to 
 stand and look at us as we passed. The house is in 
 the Italian style, with a dome on top, and wide terraces 
 with stone balustrades around it. 
 
 &quot; Lady Mary met me at the door, and seemed quite 
 concerned to learn of our ill-fortune. We went through 
 a splendid suite of rooms to a drawing-room, where a 
 little tea-table was standing. 
 
 &quot; After tea Lady Mary showed me my room. It 
 had that delightful, homelike air of repose and comfort 
 they succeed so well in giving to rooms here. There 
 was a cheerful fire burning, an arm-chair drawn up be 
 side it, a sofa on the other side with a neatly arranged 
 sofa-table on which were writing materials. One of 
 

<page 321>

 the little girls had put a pot of pretty greenhouse moss 
 in a silver basket on this table, and my toilet cushion 
 was made with a place in the centre to hold a little 
 vase of flowers. Here Lady Mary left me to rest be 
 fore dressing for dinner. I sat down in an easy-chair 
 before the fire, and formed hospitable resolutions as to 
 how I would try to make rooms always look homelike 
 and pleasant to tired guests. Then came the maid to 
 know if I wanted hot water, if I wanted anything, 
 and by and by it was time for dinner. Going down 
 into the parlor I met Mr. Labouchere and we all went 
 in to dinner. It was not quite as large a party as at 
 Dunrobin, but much in the same way. No company, 
 but several ladies who were all family connections. 
 
 &quot; The following morning Lord Dufferin and Lord 
 Alfred Paget, two gentlemen of the Queen s household, 
 rode over from Windsor to lunch with us. They 
 brought news of the goings-on there. Do you remem 
 ber one night the Duchess of S. read us a letter from 
 Lady Dufferin, describing the exploits of her son, who 
 went yachting with Prince Napoleon up by Spitzber- 
 gen, and when Prince Napoleon and all the rest gave up 
 and went back, still persevered and discovered a new 
 island ? Well, this was the same man. A thin, slender 
 person, not at all the man you would fancy as a Mr. 
 Great Heart, lively, cheery, and conversational. 
 
 &quot; Lord Alfred is also very pleasant. 
 
 &quot; Lady Mary prevailed on Lord Dufferin to stay and 
 drive with us after lunch, and we went over to Clifden, 
 the duchess s villa, of which we saw the photograph at 
 Dunrobin. For grace and beauty some of the rooms 
 in this place exceed any I have yet seen in England. 
 

<page 322>
WHAT THE QUEEN THOUGHT OF DRED. 285 
 
 &quot; When we came back my first thought was whether 
 Aunt Mary and the girls had come. Just as we were 
 all going up to dress for dinner they appeared. Mean 
 while, the Queen had sent over from Windsor for Lady 
 Mary and her husband to dine with her that evening, 
 and such invitations are understood as commands. 
 
 &quot; So, although they themselves had invited four or 
 five people to dinner, they had to go and leave us to 
 entertain ourselves. Lady Mary was dressed very 
 prettily in a flounced white silk dress with a pattern of 
 roses woven round the bottom of each flounce, and 
 looked very elegant. Mr. Labouchere wore breeches, 
 with knee and shoe buckles sparkling with diamonds. 
 
 &quot; They got home soon after we had left the drawing- 
 room, as the Queen always retires at eleven. No late 
 hours for her. 
 
 &quot; The next day Lady Mary told me that the Queen 
 had talked to her all about Dred, and how she pre 
 ferred it to Uncle Tom s Cabin/ how interested she 
 was in Nina, how provoked when she died, and how 
 she was angry that something dreadful did not happen 
 to Tom Gordon. She inquired for papa, and the rest 
 of the family, all of whom she seemed to be well in 
 formed about. 
 
 &quot; The next morning we had Lord DufPerin again to 
 breakfast. He is one of the most entertaining young 
 men I have seen in England, full of real thought and 
 noble feeling, and has a wide range of reading. He 
 had read all our American literature, and was very 
 flattering in his remarks on Hawthorne, Poe, and Long 
 fellow. I find J. R. Lowell less known, however, than 
 he deserves to be. 
 

<page 323>
286 DEED. 
 
 &quot; Lord Dufferin says that his mother wrote him some 
 verses on his coming of age, and that he built a tower 
 for them and inscribed them on a brass plate. I recom 
 mend the example to you, Henry ; make yourself the 
 tower and your memory the brass plate. 
 
 &quot; This morning came also, to call, Lady Augusta 
 Bruce, Lord Elgin s daughter, one of the Duchess of 
 Kent s ladies-in-waiting ; a very excellent, sensible girl, 
 who is a strong anti-slavery body. 
 
 &quot; After lunch we drove over to Eton, and went in to 
 see the provost s house. After this, as we were passing 
 by Windsor the coachman suddenly stopped and said, 
 * The Queen is coming, my lady. We stood still and 
 the royal cortege passed. I only saw the Queen, who 
 bowed graciously. 
 
 &quot; Lady Mary stayed at our car door till it left the 
 station, and handed in a beautiful bouquet as we parted. 
 This is one of the loveliest visits I have made.&quot; 
 
 After filling a number of other pleasant engage 
 ments in England, among which was a visit in the 
 family of Charles Kingsley, Mrs. Stowe and her party 
 crossed the Channel and settled down for some months 
 in Paris for the express purpose of studying French. 
 From the French capital she writes to her husband in 
 Andover as follows : 
 
 PARIS, November 7, 1856. 
 
 MY DEAR HUSBAND, On the 28th, when your last 
 was written, I was at Charles Kingsley s. It seemed 
 odd enough to Mary and me to find ourselves, long 
 after dark, alone in a hack, driving towards the house 
 of a man whom we never had seen (nor his wife either). 
 
 My heart fluttered as, after rumbling a long way 
 

<page 324>
CHARLES KINGSLEY. 287 
 
 through the dark, we turned into a yard. We knocked 
 at a door and were met in the hall by a man who stam 
 mers a little in his speech, and whose inquiry, &quot; Is 
 this Mrs. Stowe ? &quot; was our first positive introduction. 
 Ushered into a large, pleasant parlor lighted by a coal 
 fire, which flickered on comfortable chairs, lounges, 
 pictures, statuettes, and book-cases, we took a good view 
 of him. He is tall, slender, with blue eyes, brown hair, 
 and a hale, well -browned face, and somewhat loose- 
 jointed withal. His wife is a real Spanish beauty. 
 
 How we did talk and go on for three days ! I guess 
 he is tired. I in sure we were. He is a nervous, ex 
 citable being, and talks with head, shoulders, arms, and 
 hands, while his hesitance makes it the harder. Of his 
 theology I will say more some other time. He, also, 
 has been through the great distress, the &quot; Conflict of 
 Ages,&quot; but has come out at a different end from Ed 
 ward, and stands with John Foster, though with more 
 positiveness than he. 
 
 He laughed a good deal at many stories I told him 
 of father, and seemed delighted to hear about him. 
 But he is, what I did not expect, a zealous Churchman ; 
 insists that the Church of England is the finest and 
 broadest platform a man can stand on, and that the 
 thirty-nine articles are the only ones he could subscribe 
 to. I told him you thought them the best summary 
 (of doctrine) you knew, which pleased him greatly. 
 
 Well, I got your letter to-night in Paris, at No. 19 
 Rue de Clichy, where you may as well direct your 
 future letters. 
 
 We reached Paris about eleven o clock last night 
 and took a carriage for 17 Rue de Clichy, but when 
 

<page 325>
288 DEED. 
 
 we got there, no ringing or pounding could rouse any 
 body. Finally, in despair, we remembered a card that 
 had been handed into the cars by some hotel-runner, 
 and finding it was of an English and French hotel, we 
 drove there, and secured very comfortable accommoda 
 tions. We did not get to bed until after two o clock. 
 The next morning I sent a messenger to find Mme. 
 Borione, and discovered that we had mistaken the num 
 ber, and should have gone to No. 19, which was the 
 next door ; so we took a carriage and soon found our 
 selves established here, where we have a nice parlor 
 and two bedrooms. 
 
 There are twenty-one in the family, mostly Amer 
 icans, like ourselves, come to learn to speak French. 
 One of them is a tall, handsome, young English lady, 
 Miss Durant, who is a sculptress, studying with Baron 
 de Triqueti. She took me to his studio, and he im 
 mediately remarked that she ought to get me to sit. I 
 said I would, &quot; only my French lessons.&quot; &quot; Oh,&quot; said 
 he, smiling, &quot; we will give you French lessons while 
 you sit.&quot; So I go to-morrow morning. 
 
 As usual, my horrid pictures do me a service, and 
 people seem relieved when they see me ; think me even 
 handsome &quot; in a manner.&quot; Kingsley, in his relief, ex 
 pressed as much to his wife, and as beauty has never 
 been one of my strong points I am open to flattery 
 upon it. 
 
 We had a most agreeable call from Arthur Helps 
 before we left London. He, Kingsley, and all the 
 good people are full of the deepest anxiety for our 
 American affairs. They really do feel very deeply, 
 seeing the peril so much plainer than we do in America. 
 

<page 326>
THE BARON DE TRIQUETI. 289 
 
 Sunday night. I fear I have delayed your letter too 
 long. The fact is, that of the ten days I have been 
 here I have been laid up three with severe neuralgia, 
 viz., toothache in the backbone, and since then have 
 sat all day to be modeled for my bust. 
 
 We spent the other evening with Baron de Triqueti, 
 the sculptor. He has an English wife, and. a charming 
 daughter about the age of our girls. Life in Paris is 
 altogether more simple and natural than in England. 
 They give you a plate of cake and a cup of tea in the 
 most informal, social way, the tea-kettle sings at the 
 fire, and the son and daughter busy themselves gayly 
 together making and handing tea. When tea was over, 
 M. de Triqueti showed us a manuscript copy of the Gos 
 pels, written by his mother, to console herself in a season 
 of great ill-health, and which he had illustrated all along 
 with exquisite pen-drawings, resembling the most per 
 fect line engravings. I can t describe the beauty, grace, 
 delicacy, and fullness of devotional feeling in these 
 people. He is one of the loveliest men I ever saw. 
 
 We have already three evenings in the week in which 
 we can visit and meet friends if we choose, namely, at 
 Madame MohPs, Madame Lanziel s, and Madame Bel- 
 loc s. All these salons are informal, social gatherings, 
 with no fuss of refreshments, no nonsense of any kind. 
 Just the cheeriest, heartiest, kindest little receptions you 
 ever saw. 
 
 A kiss to dear little Charley. If he could see all the 
 things that I see every day in the Tuileries and Champs 
 Elysees, he would go wild. All Paris is a general 
 whirligig out of doors, but indoors people seem steady, 
 quiet, and sober as anybody. 
 

<page 327>
290 DEED. 
 
 November 30. This is Sunday evening, and a Sun 
 day in Paris always puts me in mind of your story 
 about somebody who said, &quot; Bless you ! they make such 
 a noise that the Devil could n t meditate.&quot; All the extra 
 work and odd jobs of life are put into Sunday. Your 
 washerwoman comes Sunday, with her innocent, good- 
 humored face, and would be infinitely at a loss to know 
 why she should n t. Your bonnet, cloak, shoes, and 
 everything are sent home Sunday morning, and all the 
 way to church there is such whirligiging and pirouetting 
 along the boulevards as almost takes one s breath away. 
 Today we went to the Oratoire to hear M. Grand Pierre. 
 I could not understand much ; my French ear is not 
 quick enough to follow. I could only perceive that the 
 subject was &quot; La Charite,&quot; and that the speaker was 
 fluent, graceful, and earnest, the audience serious and 
 attentive. 
 
 Last night we were at Baron de Triqueti s again, 
 with a party invited to celebrate the birthday of their 
 eldest daughter, Blanche, a lovely girl of nineteen. 
 There were some good ladies there who had come 
 eighty leagues to meet me, and who were so delighted 
 with my miserable French that it was quite encouraging. 
 I believe I am getting over the sandbar at last, and con 
 versation is beginning to come easy to me. 
 
 There were three French gentlemen who had just 
 been reading &quot; Dred &quot; in English, and who were as ex 
 cited and full of it as could be, and I talked with them 
 to a degree that astonished myself. There is a review 
 of &quot; Dred &quot; in the &quot; Revue des Deux Mondes &quot; which 
 has long extracts from the book, and is written in a 
 very appreciative and favorable spirit. Generally speak- 
 

<page 328>
LIFE IN PARIS. 291 
 
 ing, French critics seem to have a finer appreciation of 
 my subtle shades of meaning than English. I am curi 
 ous to hear what Professor Park has to say about it. 
 There has been another review in &quot; La Presse &quot; equally 
 favorable. All seem to see the truth about American 
 slavery much plainer than people can who are in it. If 
 American ministers and Christians could see through 
 their sophistical spider-webs, with what wonder, pity, 
 and contempt they would regard their own vacillating 
 condition ! 
 
 We visit once a week at Madame Mohl s, where we 
 meet all sorts of agreeable people. Lady Elgin does n t 
 go into society now, having been struck with paralysis, 
 but sits at home and receives her friends as usual. This 
 notion of sitting always in the open air is one of her 
 peculiarities. 
 
 I must say, life in Paris is arranged more sensibly 
 than with us. Visiting involves no trouble in the feed 
 ing line. People don t go to eat. A cup of tea and 
 plate of biscuit is all, just enough to break up the 
 stiffness. 
 
 It is wonderful that the people here do not seem to 
 have got over &quot; Uncle Tom &quot; a bit. The impression 
 seems fresh as if just published. How often have they 
 said, That book has revived the Gospel among the 
 poor of France ; it has done more than all the books 
 we have published put together. It has gone among 
 the les ouvriers, among the poor of Faubourg St. 
 Antoine, and nobody knows how many have been led 
 to Christ by it. Is not this blessed, my dear husband ? 
 Is it not worth all the suffering of writing it ? 
 
 I went the other evening to M. Grand Pierre s, where 
 

<page 329>
292 DEED. 
 
 there were three rooms full of people, all as eager and 
 loving as ever we met in England or Scotland. Oh, if 
 Christians in Boston could only see the earnestness of 
 feeling with which Christians here regard slavery, and 
 their surprise and horror at the lukewarmness, to say 
 the least, of our American church ! About eleven 
 o clock we all joined in singing a hymn, then M. Grand 
 Pierre made an address, in which I was named in the 
 most affectionate and cordial manner. Then followed 
 a beautiful prayer for our country, for America, on 
 which hang so many of the hopes of Protestantism. 
 One and all then came up, and there was great shaking 
 of hands and much effusion. 
 
 Under date of December 28, Mrs. Perkins writes : 
 &quot; On Sunday we went with Mr. and Mrs. (Jacob) Abbott 
 to the Hotel des Invalides, and I think I was never 
 more interested and affected. Three or four thousand 
 old and disabled soldiers have here a beautiful and com 
 fortable home. We went to the morning service. The 
 church is very large, and the colors taken in battle are 
 hung on the walls. Some of them are so old as to be 
 moth-eaten. The service is performed, as near as pos 
 sible, in imitation of the service before a battle. The 
 drum beats the call to assemble, and the common sol 
 diers march up and station themselves in the centre of 
 the church, under the commander. All the services are 
 regulated by the beat of the drum. Only one priest 
 officiates, and soldiers are stationed around to protect 
 him. The music is from a brass band, and is very mag 
 nificent. 
 
 &quot; In the afternoon I went to vespers in the Madeleine, 
 

<page 330>
BOYS OF THE FAUBOURG ST. ANTOINE. 293 
 
 where the music was exquisite. They have two fine 
 organs at opposite ends of the church. The Adeste 
 Fidelis was sung by a single voice, accompanied by 
 the organ, and after every verse it was taken up by male 
 voices and the other organ and repeated. The effect 
 was wonderfully fine. I have always found in our 
 small churches at home that the organ was too power 
 ful and pained my head, but in these large cathedrals 
 the effect is different. The volume of sound rolls over, 
 full but soft, and I feel as though it must come from 
 another sphere. 
 
 &quot; In the evening Mr. and Mrs. Bunsen called. He is 
 a son of Chevalier Bunsen, and she a niece of Elizabeth 
 Fry, very intelligent and agreeable people.&quot; 
 
 Under date of January 25, Mrs. Stowe writes from 
 Paris : 
 
 &quot; Here is a story for Charley. The boys in the Fau 
 bourg St. Antoine are the children of ouvriers, and 
 every day their mothers give them two sous to buy a 
 dinner. When they heard I was coming to the school, 
 of their own accord they subscribed half their dinner 
 money to give to me for the poor slaves. This five- 
 franc piece I have now ; I have bought it of the cause 
 for five dollars, and am going to make a hole in it and 
 hang it round Charley s neck as a medal. 
 
 &quot;I have just completed arrangements for leaving 
 the girls at a Protestant boarding-school while I go to 
 Rome. 
 
 &quot; We expect to start the 1st of February, and my di 
 rection will be, E. Bartholimeu, 108 Via Margaretta.&quot;

 FAREWELL TO LADY BYRON. 
 
 
 
 AFTER leaving Paris Mrs. Stowe and her sister, Mrs. 
 Perkins, traveled leisurely through the South of France 
 toward Italy, stopping at Amiens, Lyons, and Mar 
 seilles. At this place they took steamer for Genoa, 
 Leghorn, and Civita Vecchia. During their last night 
 on shipboard they met with an accident, of which, and 
 their subsequent trials in reaching Rome, Mrs. Stowe 
 writes as follows : 
 
 About eleven o clock, as I had just tranquilly laid 
 down in my berth, I was roused by a grating crash, 
 accompanied by a shock that shook the whole ship, and 
 followed by the sound of a general rush on deck, tram 
 pling, scuffling, and cries. I rushed to the door and saw 
 all the gentlemen hurrying on their clothes and getting 
 confusedly towards the stairway. I went back to Mary, 
 and we put on our things in silence, and, as soon as we 
 could, got into the upper saloon. It was an hour be 
 fore we could learn anything certainly, except that we 
 

<page 332>
AN ACCIDENT AT SEA. 295 
 
 had run into another vessel. The fate of the Arctic 
 came to us both, but we did not mention it to each 
 other ; indeed, a quieter, more silent company you would 
 not often see. Had I had any confidence in the ad 
 ministration of the boat, it would have been better, but 
 as I had not, I sat in momentary uncertainty. Had 
 we then known, as we have since, the fate of a boat re 
 cently sunk in the Mediterranean by a similar careless 
 ness, it would have increased our fears. By a singular 
 chance an officer, whose wife and children were lost on 
 board that boat, was on board ours, and happened to 
 be on the forward part of the boat when the accident 
 occurred. The captain and mate were both below; 
 there was nobody looking out, and had not this officer 
 himself called out to stop the boat, we should have 
 struck her with such force as to have sunk us. As it 
 was, we turned aside and the shock came on a paddle- 
 wheel, which was broken by it, for when, after two 
 hours delay, we tried to start and had gone a little 
 way, there was another crash and the paddle-wheel 
 fell down. You may be sure we did little sleeping 
 that night. It was an inexpressible desolation to 
 think that we might never again see those we loved. 
 No one knows how much one thinks, and how rapidly, 
 in such hours. 
 
 In the Naples boat that was sunk a short time ago, 
 the women perished in a dreadful way. The shock 
 threw the chimney directly across the egress from be 
 low, so that they could not get on deck, and they 
 were all drowned in the cabin. 
 
 We went limping along with one broken limb till 
 the next day about eleven, when we reached Civita 
 

<page 333>
296 OLD SCENES REVISITED. 
 
 Vecchia, where there were two hours more of delay 
 about passports. Then we, that is, Mary and I, and a 
 Dr. Edison from Philadelphia, with his son Alfred, took 
 a carriage to Rome, but they gave us a miserable thing 
 that looked as if it had been made soon after the 
 deluge. About eight o clock at night, on a lonely 
 stretch of road, the wheel came off. We got out, and 
 our postilions stood silently regarding matters. None 
 of us could speak Italian, they could not speak French ; 
 but the driver at last conveyed the idea that for five 
 francs he could get a man to come and mend the wheel. 
 The five francs were promised, and he untackled a 
 horse and rode off. Mary and I walked up and down 
 the dark, desolate road, occasionally reminding each 
 other that we were on classic ground, and laughing at 
 the oddity of our lonely, starlight promenade. After 
 a while our driver came back, Tag, Rag, and Bobtail 
 at his heels. I don t think I can do greater justice to 
 Italian costumes than by this respectable form of words. 
 Then there was another consultation. They put a 
 bit of rotten timber under to pry the carriage up. 
 Fortunately, it did not break, as we all expected it 
 would, till after the wheel was on. Then a new train 
 of thought was suggested. How was it to be kept on ? 
 Evidently they had not thought far in that direction, 
 for they had brought neither hammer nor nail, nor 
 tool of any kind, and therefore they looked first at the 
 wheel, then at each other, and then at us. The doctor 
 now produced a little gimlet, with the help of which 
 the broken fragments of the former linchpin were 
 pushed out, and the way was cleared for a new one. 
 Then they began knocking a fence to pieces to get out 
 

<page 334>
A NIGHT OF DISCOMFORTS. 297 
 
 nails, but none could be found to fit. At last another 
 ambassador was sent back for nails. While we were 
 thus waiting, the diligence, in which many of our ship s 
 company were jogging on to Rome, came up. They 
 had plenty of room inside, and one of the party, seeing 
 our distress, tried hard to make the driver stop, but he 
 doggedly persisted in going on, and declared if any 
 body got down to help us he would leave him behind. 
 
 An interesting little episode here occurred. It was 
 raining, and Mary and I proposed, as the wheel was now 
 on, to take our seats. We had no sooner done so than 
 the horses were taken with a sudden fit of animation 
 and ran off with us in the most vivacious manner, Tag, 
 Rag, and Co. shouting in the rear. Some heaps of 
 stone a little in advance presented an interesting pros 
 pect by way of a terminus. However, the horses were 
 luckily captured before the wheel was off again ; and 
 our ambassador being now returned, we were set right 
 and again proceeded. 
 
 I must not forget to remark that at every post where 
 we changed horses and drivers, we had a pitched battle 
 with the driver for more money than we had been told 
 was the regular rate, and the carriage was surrounded 
 with a perfect mob of ragged, shock-headed, black-eyed 
 people, whose words all ended in &quot; ino,&quot; and who raved 
 and ranted at us till finally we paid much more than 
 we ought, to get rid of them. 
 
 At the gates of Rome the official, after looking at 
 our passports, coolly told the doctor that if he had a 
 mind to pay him five francs he could go in without 
 further disturbance, but if not he would keep the bag 
 gage till morning. This form of statement had the 
 

<page 335>
298 OLD SCENES REVISITED. 
 
 recommendation of such precision and neatness of ex 
 pression that we paid him forthwith, and into Rome 
 we dashed at two o clock in the morning of the 9th of 
 February, 1857, in a drizzling rain. 
 
 We drove to the Hotel d Angleterre, it was full, 
 and ditto to four or five others, and in the last effort 
 our refractory wheel came off again, and we all got out 
 into the street. About a dozen lean, ragged &quot; corbies,&quot; 
 who are called porters and who are always lying in wait 
 for travelers, pounced upon us. They took down our 
 baggage in a twinkling, and putting it all into the 
 street surrounded it, and chattered over it, while M. 
 and I stood in the rain and received first lessons in 
 Italian. How we did try to say something ! but they 
 could n t talk anything but in &quot; ino &quot; as aforesaid. 
 The doctor finally found a man who could speak a 
 word or two of French, and leaving Mary, Alfred, and 
 me to keep watch over our pile of trunks, he went off 
 with him to apply for lodgings. I have heard many 
 flowery accounts of first impressions of Rome. I must 
 say ours was somewhat sombre. 
 
 A young man came by and addressed us in English. 
 How cheering ! We almost flew upon him. We begged 
 him, at least, to lend us his Italian to call another car 
 riage, and he did so. A carriage which was passing 
 was luckily secured, and Mary and I, with all our store 
 of boxes and little parcels, were placed in it out of the 
 rain, at least. Here we sat while the doctor from time 
 to time returned from his wanderings to tell us he 
 could find no place. &quot; Can it be,&quot; said I, &quot; that we 
 are to be obliged to spend a night in the streets ? &quot; 
 What made it seem more odd was the knowledge that, 
 

<page 336>
LODGINGS IN ROME. 299 
 
 could we only find them, we had friends enough in 
 Rome who would be glad to entertain us. We began 
 to speculate on lodgings. Who knows what we may 
 get entrapped into ? Alfred suggested stories he had 
 read of beds placed on trap-doors, of testers which 
 screwed down on people and smothered them ; and so, 
 when at last the doctor announced lodgings found, we 
 followed in rather an uncertain frame of mind. 
 
 We alighted at a dirty stone passage, smelling of 
 cats and onions, damp, cold, and earthy, we went up 
 stone stairways, and at last were ushered into two very 
 decent chambers, where we might lay our heads. The 
 &quot; corbies &quot; all followed us, black-haired, black-browed, 
 ragged, and clamorous as ever. They insisted that we 
 should pay the pretty little sum of twenty francs, or 
 four dollars, for bringing our trunks about twenty steps. 
 The doctor modestly but firmly declined to be thus im 
 posed upon, and then ensued a general &quot; chatteration ; &quot; 
 one and all fell into attitudes, and the &quot; inos &quot; and 
 &quot; issimos &quot; rolled freely. &quot; For pity s sake get them 
 off,&quot; we said ; so we made a truce for ten francs, but 
 still they clamored, forced their way even into our bed 
 room, and were only repulsed by a loud and combined 
 volley of &quot; No, no, noes ! &quot; which we all set up at once, 
 upon which they retreated. 
 
 Our hostess was a little French woman, and that re 
 assured us. I examined the room, and seeing no trace 
 of treacherous testers, or trap-doors, resolved to avail 
 myself without fear of the invitation of a very clean, 
 white bed, where I slept till morning without dreaming. 
 
 The next day we sent our cards to M. Bartholimeu, 
 and before we had finished breakfast he was on the 
 

<page 337>
300 OLD SCENES REVISITED. 
 
 spot. We then learned that he had been watching the 
 diligence office for over a week, and that he had the 
 pleasant set of apartments we are now occupying all 
 ready and waiting for us.

 MY DEAR HUSBAND, Every day is opening to me 
 a new world of wonders here in Italy. I have been in 
 the Catacombs, where I was shown many memorials of 
 the primitive Christians, and to-day we are going to the 
 Vatican. The weather is sunny and beautiful beyond 
 measure, and flowers are springing in the fields on 
 every side. Oh, my dear, how I do long to have you 
 here to enjoy what you are so much better fitted to ap 
 preciate than I, this wonderful combination of the 
 past and the present, of what has been and what is ! 
 
 Think of strolling leisurely through the Forum, of 
 seeing the very stones that were laid in the time of the 
 Republic, of rambling over the ruined Palace of the 
 Caesars, of walking under the Arch of Titus, of seeing 
 the Dying Gladiator, and whole ranges of rooms filled 
 with wonders of art, all in one morning ! All this I 
 did on Saturday, and only wanted you. You know so 
 much more and could appreciate so much better. At 
 the Palace of the Caesars, where the very dust is a 
 melange of exquisite marbles, I saw for the first time 
 an acanthus growing, and picked my first leaf. 
 
 Our little menage moves on prosperously ; the doctor 
 takes excellent care of us and we of him. One sees 
 everybody here at Rome, John Bright, Mrs. Hemans 
 son, Mrs. Gaskell, etc., etc. Over five thousand English 
 travelers are said to be here. Jacob Abbot and wife are 
 coming. Rome is a world ! Rome is an astonishment !

VESUVIUS. 301 
 
 Papal Rome is an enchantress ! Old as she is, she is 
 like Ninon d Enclos, the young fall in love with her. 
 
 You will hear next from us at Naples. 
 
 Affectionately yours, H. B. S. 
 
 * 
 
 From Rome the travelers went to Naples, and after 
 visiting Pompeii and Herculaneum made the ascent of 
 Vesuvius, a graphic account of which is contained in a 
 letter written at this time by Mrs. Stowe to her daugh 
 ters in Paris. After describing the preparations and 
 start, she says : 
 
 &quot; Gradually the ascent became steeper and steeper, 
 till at length it was all our horses could do to pull us 
 up. The treatment of horses in Naples is a thing that 
 takes away much from the pleasure and comfort of 
 such travelers as have the least feeling for animals. 
 The people seem absolutely to have no consideration 
 for them. You often see vehicles drawn by one horse 
 carrying fourteen or fifteen great, stout men and women. 
 This is the worse as the streets are paved with flat 
 stones which are exceedingly slippery. On going up 
 hill the drivers invariably race their horses, urging 
 them on with a constant storm of blows. 
 
 &quot; As the ascent of the mountain became steeper, the 
 horses panted and trembled in a way that made us feel 
 that we could not sit in the carriage, yet the guide 
 and driver never made the slightest motion to leave 
 the box. At last three of us got out and walked, and 
 invited our guide to do the same, yet with all this re 
 lief the last part of the ascent was terrible, and the 
 rascally fellows actually forced the horses to it by beat 
 ing them with long poles on the back of their legs. 
 

<page 339>

 No Englishman or American would ever allow a horse 
 to be treated so. 
 
 &quot; The Hermitage is a small cabin, where one can buy 
 a little wine or any other refreshment one may need. 
 There is a species of wine made of the grape* of Vesu 
 vius, called Lachryma Christi/ that has a great reputa 
 tion. Here was a miscellaneous collection of beggars, 
 ragged boys, men playing guitars, bawling donkey 
 drivers, and people wanting to sell sticks or minerals, 
 the former to assist in the ascent, and the latter as 
 specimens of the place. In the midst of the commo 
 tion we were placed on our donkeys, and the serious, 
 pensive brutes moved away. At last we reached the 
 top of the mountain, and I gladly sprang on firm land. 
 The whole top of the mountain was covered with wa 
 vering wreaths of smoke, from the shadows of which 
 emerged two English gentlemen, who congratulated us 
 on our safe arrival, and assured us that we were fortu 
 nate in our day, as the mountain was very active. We 
 could hear a hollow, roaring sound, like the burning of 
 
 O O 
 
 a great furnace, but saw nothing. Is this all ? I 
 said. e Oh, no. Wait till the guide comes up with 
 the rest of the party, and soon one after another came 
 up, and we then followed the guide up a cloudy, rocky 
 path, the noise of the fire constantly becoming nearer. 
 Finally we stood on the verge of a vast, circular pit 
 about forty feet deep, the floor of which is of black, 
 ropy waves of congealed lava. 
 
 The sides are sulphur cliffs, stained in every brilliant 
 shade, from lightest yellow to deepest orange and 
 brown. In the midst of the lava floor rises a black 
 cone, the chimney of the great furnace. This was 
 

<page 340>
VOLCANIC MARVELS. 303 
 
 burning and flaming like the furnace of a glass-house, 
 and every few moments throwing up showers of cinders 
 and melted lava which fell with a rattling sound on the 
 black floor of the pit. One small bit of the lava came 
 over and -, fell at our feet, and a gentleman lighted his 
 cigar at it. 
 
 &quot; All around where we stood the smoke was issuing 
 from every chance rent and fissure of the rock, and the 
 Neapolitans who crowded round us were every moment 
 soliciting us to let them cook us an egg in one of these 
 rifts, and, overcome by persuasion, I did so, and found 
 it very nicely boiled, or rather steamed, though the 
 shell tasted of Glauber s salt and sulphur. 
 
 &quot; The whole place recalled to my mind so vividly 
 Milton s description of the infernal regions, that I 
 could not but believe that he had drawn the imagery 
 from this source. Milton, as we all know, was some 
 time in Italy, and, although I do not recollect any 
 account of his visiting Vesuvius, I cannot think how he 
 should have shaped his language so coincidently to the 
 phenomena if he had not. 
 
 C&quot; On the way down the mountain our ladies aston 
 ished the natives by making an express stipulation that 
 our donkeys were not to be beaten, why, they could 
 not conjecture. The idea of any feeling of compassion 
 for an animal is so foreign to a Neapolitan s thoughts 
 that they supposed it must be some want of courage on 
 our partly When, once in a while, the old habit so pre 
 vailed that the boy felt that he must strike the donkey, 
 and when I forbade him, he would say, * Courage, sig- 
 nora, courage. 
 
 &quot; Time would fail me to tell the whole of our adven- 
 

<page 341>

 tures in Southern Italy. We left it with regret, and I 
 will tell you some time by word of mouth what else we 
 saw. 
 
 &quot; We went by water from Naples to Leghorn, and 
 were gloriously seasick, all of us. From Leghorn we 
 went to Florence, where we abode two weeks nearly. 
 Two days ago we left Florence and started for Venice, 
 stopping one day and two nights en route at Bologna. 
 Here we saw the great university, now used as a library, 
 the walls of which are literally covered with the embla 
 zoned names and coats of arms of distinguished men 
 who were educated there. 
 
 &quot; Venice. The great trouble of traveling in Europe, 
 or indeed of traveling anywhere, is that you can never 
 catch romance. No sooner are you in any place than 
 being there seems the most natural, matter-of-fact 
 occurrence in the world. Nothing looks foreign or 
 strange to you. You take your tea and your dinner, 
 eat, drink, and sleep as aforetime, and scarcely realize 
 where you are or what you are seeing. But Venice is 
 an exception to this state of things ; it is all romance 
 from beginning to end, and never ceases to seem 
 strange and picturesque. 
 
 &quot; It was a rainy evening when our cars rumbled over 
 the long railroad bridge across the lagoon that leads to 
 the station. Nothing but flat, dreary swamps, and 
 then the wide expanse of sea on either side. The cars 
 stopped, and the train, being a long one, left us a little 
 out of the station. We got out in a driving rain, in 
 company with flocks of Austrian soldiers, with whom 
 the third-class cars were filled. We went through a 
 long passage, and emerged into a room where all na- 
 

<page 342>
VENICE. 305 
 
 tions seemed commingling ; Italians, Germans, French, 
 Austrians, Orientals, all in wet weather trim. 
 
 &quot; Soon, however, the news was brought that our bag 
 gage was looked out and our gondolas ready. 
 
 &quot; The first plunge under the low, black hood of a 
 gondola, especially of a rainy night, has something 
 funereal in it. Four of us sat cowering together, and 
 looked, out of the rain-dropped little windows at the 
 sides, at the scene. Gondolas of all sizes were gliding 
 up and down, with their sharp, fishy-looking prows of 
 steel pushing their ways silently among each other, 
 while gondoliers shouted and jabbered, and made as 
 much confusion in their way as terrestrial hackmen on 
 dry land. Soon, however, trunks and carpet-bags be 
 ing adjusted, we pushed off, and went gliding away 
 up the Grand Canal, with a motion so calm that we 
 could scarce discern it except by the moving of objects 
 on shore. Venice, la belle, appeared to as much dis 
 advantage as a beautiful woman bedraggled in a thun 
 der-storm.&quot; 
 
 &quot; Lake Como. We stayed in Venice five days, and 
 during that time saw all the sights that it could enter 
 the head of a valet-de-place to afflict us with. It is an 
 affliction, however, for which there is no remedy, be 
 cause you want to see the things, and would be very 
 sorry if you went home without having done so. From 
 Venice we went to Milan to see the cathedral and 
 Leonardo da Vinci s Last Supper. The former is 
 superb, and of the latter I am convinced, from the little 
 that remains of it, that it was the greatest picture the 
 world ever saw. We shall run back to Rome for Holy 
 Week, and then to Paris. 
 

<page 343>
306 OLD SCENES REVISITED. 
 
 &quot; Home. From Lake Como we came back here for 
 Holy Week, and now it is over. 
 
 &quot; What do you think of it ? 
 
 &quot; Certainly no thoughtful or sensitive person, no per 
 son impressible either through the senses or the reli 
 gious feelings, can fail to feel it deeply. 
 
 &quot; In the first place, the mere fact of the different 
 nations of the earth moving, so many of them, with 
 one accord, to so old and venerable a city, to celebrate 
 the death and resurrection of Jesus, is something in it 
 self affecting. Whatever dispute there may be about the 
 other commemorative feasts of Christendom, the time 
 of this epoch is fixed unerringly by the Jews Passover. 
 That great and solemn feast, therefore, stands as an 
 historical monument to mark the date of the most im 
 portant and thrilling events which this world ever wit 
 nessed. 
 
 &quot; When one sees the city filling with strangers, pil 
 grims arriving on foot, the very shops decorating them 
 selves in expectancy, every church arranging its ser 
 vices, the prices even of temporal matters raised by 
 the crowd and its demands, he naturally thinks, Where 
 fore, why is all this? and he must be very careless 
 indeed if it do not bring to mind, in a more real way 
 than before, that at this very time, so many years ago, 
 Christ and his apostles were living actors in the scenes 
 thus celebrated to-day.&quot; 
 
 As the spring was now well advanced, it was deemed 
 advisable to bring this pleasant journey to a close, and 
 for Mrs. Stowe at least it was imperative that she return 
 to America. Therefore, leaving Rome with many re 
 grets and lingering, backward glances, the two sisters 
 

<page 344>
HOMEWARD BOUND. 307 
 
 hurried to Paris, where they found their brother-in- 
 law, Mr. John Hooker, awaiting them. Under date of 
 May 3 Mrs. Stowe writes from Paris to her husband : 
 &quot; Here I am once more, safe in Paris after a fatiguing 
 journey. I found the girls well, and greatly improved 
 in their studies. As to bringing them home with me 
 now, I have come to the conclusion that it would not 
 be expedient. A few months more of study here will 
 do them a world of good. I have, therefore, arranged 
 that they shall come in November in the Arago, with 
 a party of friends who are going at that time. 
 
 &quot; John Hooker is here, so Mary is going with him 
 and some others for a few weeks into Switzerland. I 
 have some business affairs to settle in England, and 
 shall sail from Liverpool in the Europa on the sixth 
 of June. I am so homesick to-day, and long with a 
 great longing to be with you once more. I am impa 
 tient to go, and yet dread the voyage. Still, to reach 
 you I must commit myself once more to the ocean, of 
 which at times I have a nervous horror, as to the arms 
 of my Father. The sea is his, and He made it. It 
 is a rude, noisy old servant, but it is always obedient 
 to his will, and cannot carry me beyond his power and 
 love, wherever or to whatever it bears me.&quot; 
 
 Having established her daughters in a Protestant 
 boarding-school in Paris, Mrs. Stowe proceeded to Lon 
 don. While there she received the following letter 
 from Harriet Martineau : 
 
 AMBLF.SIDE, June 1. 
 
 DEAR MRS. STOWE, I have been at my wits end 
 to learn how to reach you, as your note bore no direc 
 tion but &quot; London.&quot; Arnolds, Croppers, and others 
 

<page 345>
308 OLD SCENES REVISITED. 
 
 could give no light, and the newspapers tell only where 
 you had been. So I commit this to your publishers, 
 trusting that it will find you somewhere, and in time, 
 perhaps, bring you here. Can t you come ? You are 
 aware that we shall never meet if you don t come soon. 
 I see no strangers at all, but I hope to have breath and 
 strength enough for a little talk with you, if you could 
 come. You could have perfect freedom at the times 
 when I am laid up, and we could seize my &quot; capability 
 seasons &quot; for our talk. 
 
 The weather and scenery are usually splendid just 
 now. Did I see you (in white frock and black silk 
 apron) when I was in Ohio in 1835 ? Your sister I 
 knew well, and I have a clear recollection of your 
 father. I believe and hope you were the young lady in 
 the black silk apron. 
 
 Do you know I rather dreaded reading your book ! 
 Sick people are weak : and one of my chief weaknesses 
 is dislike of novels, (except some old ones which I 
 almost know by heart). I knew that with you I should 
 be safe from the cobweb-spinning of our modern subjec 
 tive novelists and the jaunty vulgarity of our &quot; funny 
 philosophers &quot; the Dickens sort, who have tired us 
 out. But I dreaded the alternative, the too strong 
 interest. But oh ! the delight I have had in &quot; Dred ! &quot; 
 The genius carries all before it, and drowns everything 
 in glorious pleasure. So marked a work of genius 
 claims exemption from every sort of comparison ; but, 
 as you ask for my opinion of the book, you may like 
 to know that I think it far superior to &quot; Uncle Tom.&quot; 
 I have no doubt that a multitude of people will say it 
 is a falling off, because they made up their minds that 
 

<page 346>
DRED SUPERIOR TO UNCLE TOM 309 
 
 any new book of yours must be inferior to that, and 
 because it is so rare a thing for a prodigious fame to 
 be sustained by a second book ; but, in my own mind 
 I am entirely convinced that the second book is by far 
 the best. Such faults as you have ar6 in the artistic 
 department, and there is less defect in &quot; Dred &quot; than in 
 &quot; Uncle Tom,&quot; and the whole material and treatment 
 seem to me richer and more substantial. I have had 
 critiques of &quot; Dred &quot; from the two very wisest people I 
 know perfectly unlike each other (the critics, I mean), 
 and they delight me by thinking exactly like each other 
 and like me. They distinctly prefer it to &quot; Uncle Tom.&quot; 
 To say the plain truth, it seems to me so splendid 
 a work of genius that nothing that I can say can give 
 you an idea of the intensity of admiration with which 
 I read it. It seemed to me, as I told my nieces, that 
 our English fiction writers had better shut up alto 
 gether and have done with it, for one will have no pa 
 tience with any but didactic writing after yours. My 
 nieces (and you may have heard that Maria, my nurse, 
 is very, very clever) are thoroughly possessed with the 
 book, and Maria says she feels as if a fresh department 
 of human life had been opened to her since this day 
 week. I feel the freshness no less, while, from my 
 travels, I can be even more assured of the truthfulness 
 of your wonderful representation. I see no limit to the 
 good it may do by suddenly splitting open Southern 
 life, for everybody to look into. It is precisely the 
 thing that is most wanted, just as &quot; Uncle Tom &quot; was 
 wanted, three years since, to show what negro slavery 
 in your republic was like. It is plantation-life, particu 
 larly in the present case, that I mean. As for your 
 

<page 347>
310 OLD SCENES REVISITED. 
 
 exposure of the weakness and helplessness ot the 
 churches, I deeply honor you for the courage with 
 which you have made the exposure ; but I don t sup 
 pose that any amendment is to be looked for in that 
 direction. You have unburdened your own soul in 
 that matter, and if they had been corrigible, you would 
 have helped a good many more. But I don t expect 
 that result. The Southern railing at you will be some 
 thing unequaled, I suppose. I hear that three of us 
 have the honor of being abused from day to day al 
 ready, as most portentous and shocking women, you, 
 Mrs. Chapman, and myself (as the traveler of twenty 
 years ago). Not only newspapers, but pamphlets of 
 such denunciation are circulated, I m told. I m afraid 
 now I, and even Mrs. Chapman, must lose our fame, 
 and all the railing will be engrossed by you. My little 
 function is to keep English people tolerably right, by 
 means of a London daily paper, while the danger of 
 misinformation and misreading from the &quot; Times &quot; con 
 tinues. I can t conceive how such a paper as the 
 &quot; Times &quot; can fail to be better informed than it is. At 
 tunes it seems as if its New York correspondent was 
 making game of it. The able and excellent editor of 
 the &quot; Daily News &quot; gives me complete liberty on Amer 
 ican subjects, and Mrs. Chapman s and other friends 
 constant supply of information enables me to use this 
 liberty for making the cause better understood. I 
 hope I shall hear that you are coming. It is like a 
 great impertinence my having written so freely about 
 your book : but you asked my opinion, that is all I 
 can say. Thank you much for sending the book to 
 me. If you come you will write our names in it, and 
 

<page 348>
MR. PRESCOTT ON DEED. 311 
 
 this will make it a valuable legacy to a nephew or 
 niece. 
 
 Believe me gratefully and affectionately yours, 
 
 HARRIET MARTINEAU. 
 
 In London Mrs. Stowe also received the following 
 letter from Prescott, the historian, which after long 
 wandering had finally rested quietly at her English 
 publishers awaiting her coming. 
 
 PEPPERELL, October 4, 1856. 
 
 MY DEAR MRS. STOWE, I am much obliged to you 
 for the copy of &quot; Dred &quot; which Mr. Phillips put into 
 my hands. It has furnished us our evening s amuse 
 ment since we have been in the country, where we 
 spend the brilliant month of October. 
 
 The African race are much indebted to you for show 
 ing up the good sides of their characters, their cheer 
 fulness, and especially their powers of humor, which are 
 admirably set off by their peculiar patois, in the same 
 manner as the expression of the Scottish sentiment is 
 by the peculiar Scottish dialect. People differ ; but I 
 was most struck among your characters with Uncle 
 Tiff and Nina. The former a variation of good old 
 Uncle Tom, though conceived in a merrier vein than 
 belonged to that sedate personage ; the difference of 
 their tempers in this respect being well suited to the 
 difference of the circumstances in which they were 
 placed. But Nina, to my mind, is the true hero of the 
 book, which I should have named after her instead of 
 &quot; Dred.&quot; She is indeed a charming conception, full of 
 what is called character, and what is masculine in her 
 

<page 349>
312 OLD SCENES REVISITED. 
 
 nature is toned down by such a delightful sweetness 
 and kindness of disposition as makes her perfectly fas 
 cinating. I cannot forgive you for smothering her so 
 prematurely. No dramatis personce could afford the 
 loss of such a character. But I will not bore you with 
 criticism, of which you have had quite enough. I must 
 thank you, however, for giving Tom Gordon a gutta- 
 percha cane to perform his flagellations with. 
 
 I congratulate you on the brilliant success of the 
 work, unexampled even in this age of authorship ; and, 
 as Mr. Phillips informs me, greater even in the old 
 country than in ours. I am glad you are likely to set 
 tle the question and show that a Yankee writer can get 
 a copyright in England little thanks to our own gov 
 ernment, which compels him to go there in order to 
 get it. 
 
 With sincere regard, believe me, dear Mrs. Stowe, 
 Very truly yours, WM. H. PRESCOTT. 
 
 From Liverpool, on the eve of her departure for 
 America, Mrs. Stowe wrote to her daughters in Paris : 
 
 I spent the day before leaving London with Lady 
 Byron. She is lovelier than ever, and inquired kindly 
 about you both. I left London to go to Manchester, 
 and reaching there found the Rev. Mr. Gaskell waiting 
 to welcome me in the station. Mrs. Gaskell seems lovely 
 at home, where besides being a writer she proves her 
 self to be a first-class housekeeper, and performs all 
 the duties of a minister s wife. After spending a de 
 lightful day with her I came here to the beautiful 
 &quot; Dingle,&quot; which is more enchanting than ever. I am

 staying with Mrs. Edward Cropper, Lord Denman s 
 daughter. 
 
 I want you to tell Aunt Mary that Mr. Ruskin lives 
 with his father at a place called Denmark Hill, Camber- 
 well. He has told me that the gallery of Turner pic 
 tures there is open to me or my friends at any time of 
 the day or night. Both young and old Mr. Ruskin are 
 fine fellows, sociable and hearty, and wiU cordially wel 
 come any of my friends who desire to look at their 
 pictures. 
 
 I write in haste, as I must be aboard the ship to 
 morrow at eight o clock. So good-by, my dear girls, 
 from your ever affectionate mother. 
 
 Her last letter written before sailing was to Lady 
 Byron, and serves to show how warm an intimacy had 
 sprung up between them. It was as f oUows : 
 
 June 5, 1857. 
 
 DEAR FRIEND, I left you with a strange sort of 
 yearning, throbbing feeling you make me feel quite 
 as I did years ago, a sort of girlishness quite odd for 
 me. I have felt a strange longing to send you some 
 thing. Don t smile when you see what it turns out to 
 be. I have a weakness for your pretty Parian things ; 
 it is one of my own home peculiarities to have strong 
 passions for pretty tea-cups and other little matters 
 for my own quiet meals, when, as often happens, I am 
 too unwell to join the family. So I sentl you a cup 
 made of primroses, a funny little pitcher, quite large 
 enough for cream, and a little vase for violets and 
 primroses which will be lovely together and when 
 

<page 351>
314 OLD SCENES REVISITED. 
 
 you use it think of me and that I love you more than I 
 can say. 
 
 I often think how strange it is that I should know 
 you you who were a sort of legend of my early days 
 that I should love you is only a natural result. You 
 seem to me to stand on the confines of that land where 
 the poor formalities which separate hearts here pass like 
 mist before the sun, and therefore it is that I feel the 
 language of love must not startle you as strange or un 
 familiar. You are so nearly there in spirit that I fear 
 with every adieu that it may be the last ; yet did you 
 pass within the veil I should not feel you lost. 
 
 I have got past the time when I feel that my heav 
 enly friends are lost by going there. I feel them 
 nearer, rather than farther off. 
 
 So good-by, dear, dear friend, and if you see morn 
 ing in our Father s house before I do, carry my love to 
 those that wait for me, and if I pass first, you will find 
 me there, and we shall love each other forever. 
 
 Ever yours, H. B. STOWE. 
 
 The homeward voyage proved a prosperous one, and 
 it was followed by a joyous welcome to the &quot; Cabin &quot; 
 in Andover. The world seemed very bright, and amid 
 all her happiness came no intimation of the terrible 
 blow about to descend upon the head of the devoted 
 mother.

 DAUGHTER. DEPARTURE FOR EUROPE. 
 
 IMMEDIATELY after Mrs. Stowe s return from Eng 
 land in June, 1857, a crushing sorrow came upon her 
 in the death of her oldest son, Henry Ellis, who was 
 drowned while bathing in the Connecticut River at 
 Hanover, N. H., where he was pursuing his studies as 
 a member of the Freshman class in Dartmouth Col 
 lege. This melancholy event took place the 9th of 
 July, 1857, and the 3d of August Mrs. Stowe wrote to 
 the Duchess of Sutherland : 
 
 DEAR FRIEND, Before this reaches you you will 
 have perhaps learned from other sources of the sad 
 blow which has fallen upon us, our darling, our good, 
 beautiful boy, snatched away in the moment of health 
 and happiness. Alas ! could I know that when I parted 
 from my Henry on English shores that I should never 
 see him more ? I returned to my home, and, amid the

 jubilee of meeting the rest, was fain to be satisfied with 
 only a letter from him, saying that his college examina 
 tions were coming on, and he must defer seeing me a 
 week or two till they were over. I thought then of 
 taking his younger brother and going up to visit him ; 
 but the health of the latter seeming unfavorably af 
 fected by the seacoast air, I turned back with him to 
 a water-cure establishment. Before I had been two 
 weeks absent a fatal telegram hurried me home, and 
 when I arrived there it was to find the house filled with 
 his weeping classmates, who had just come bringing 
 his remains. There he lay so calm, so placid, so peace 
 ful, that I could not believe that he would not smile 
 upon me, and that my voice which always had such 
 power over him could not recall him. There had al 
 ways been such a peculiar union, such a tenderness 
 between us. I had had such power always to call up 
 answering feelings to my own, that it seemed impossible 
 that he could be silent and unmoved at my grief. But 
 yet, dear friend, I am sensible that in this last sad scene 
 I had an alleviation that was not granted to you. I 
 recollect, in the mournful letter you wrote me about 
 that time, you said that you mourned that you had 
 never told your own dear one how much you loved him. 
 That sentence touched me at the time. I laid it to 
 heart, and from that time lost no occasion of express 
 ing to my children those feelings that we too often defer 
 to express to our dearest friends till it is forever too 
 late. 
 
 He did fully know how I loved him, and some of the 
 last loving words he spoke were of me. The very day 
 that he was taken from us, and when he was just rising 
 

<page 354>
THE SHADOW OF DEATH. 317 
 
 from the table of his boarding-house to go whence he 
 never returned, some one noticed the seal ring, which 
 you may remember to have seen on his finger, and said, 
 How beautiful that ring is ! Yes, he said, and best of 
 all, it was my mother s gift to me. That ring, taken 
 from the lifeless hand a few hours later, was sent to 
 me. Singularly enough, it is broken right across the 
 name from a fall a little time previous. . . . 
 
 It is a great comfort to me, dear friend, that I took 
 Henry with me to Dunrobin. I hesitated about keep 
 ing him so long from his studies, but still I thought a 
 mind so observing and appreciative might learn from 
 such a tour more than through books, and so it was. 
 He returned from England full of high resolves and 
 manly purposes. &quot; I may not be what the world calls 
 a Christian,&quot; he wrote, &quot; but I will live such a life as a 
 Christian ought to live, such a life as every true man 
 ought to live.&quot; Henceforth he became remarkable for 
 a strict order and energy, and a vigilant temperance and 
 care of his bodily health, docility and deference to his 
 parents and teachers, and perseverance in every duty. 
 . . . Well, from the hard battle of this life he is excused, 
 and the will is taken for the deed, and whatever comes 
 his heart will not be pierced as mine is. But I am glad 
 that I can connect him with all my choicest remem 
 brances of the Old World. 
 
 Dunrobin will always be dearer to me now, and I 
 have felt towards you and the duke a turning of spirit, 
 because I remember how kindly you always looked on 
 and spoke to him. I knew then it was the angel of your 
 lost one that stirred your hearts with tenderness when 
 you looked on another so near his age. The plaid that 
 

<page 355>
318 THE MINISTERS WOOING. 
 
 the duke gave him, and which he valued as one of the 
 chief of his boyish treasures, will hang in his room 
 for still we have a room that we call his. 
 
 You will understand, you will feel, this sorrow with 
 us as few can. My poor husband is much prostrated. 
 I need not say more : you know what this must be to a 
 father s heart. But still I repeat what I said when I 
 saw you last. . Our dead are ministering angels; they 
 teach us to love, they fill us with tenderness for all that 
 can suffer. These weary hours when sorrow makes us 
 for the time blind and deaf and dumb, have their 
 promise. These hours come in answer to our prayers 
 for nearness to God It is always our treasure that the 
 lightning strikes. ... I have poured out my heart to 
 you because you can understand. While I was visiting 
 in Hanover, where Henry died, a poor, deaf old slave 
 woman, who has still five children in bondage, came to 
 comfort me. &quot; Bear up, dear soul, she said ; you must 
 bear it, for the Lord loves ye.&quot; She said further, 
 &quot; Sunday is a heavy day to me, cause I can t work, and 
 can t hear preaching, and can t read, so I can t keep my 
 mind off my poor children. Some on em the blessed 
 Master s got, and they s safe ; but, oh, there are five 
 that I don t know where they are.&quot; 
 
 What are our mother sorrows to this ! I shall try 
 to search out and redeem these children, though, from 
 the ill success of efforts already made, I fear it will be 
 hopeless. Every sorrow I have, every lesson on the 
 sacredness of family love, makes me the more deter 
 mined to resist to the last this dreadful evil that makes 
 so many mothers so much deeper mourners than I ever 
 can be. ... 
 
 Affectionately yours, H. B. STOWK. 
 

<page 356>

<page 357>

<page 358>
&quot;HE HATH SET ME IN DARK PLACES.&quot; 319 
 
 About this same time she writes to her daughters in 
 Paris : &quot; Can anybody tell what sorrows are locked up 
 with our best affections, or what pain may be associated 
 with every pleasure ? As I walk the house, the pic 
 tures he used to love, the presents I brought him, and 
 the photographs I meant to show him, all pierce my 
 heart. I have had a dreadful faintness of sorrow come 
 over me at times. I have felt so crushed, so bleeding, 
 so helpless, that I could only call on my Saviour with 
 groanings that could not be uttered. Your papa justly 
 said, Every child that dies is for the tune being an 
 only one ; yes his individuality no time, no change, 
 can ever replace/ 
 
 &quot; Two days after the funeral your father and I went 
 to Hanover. We saw Henry s friends, and his room, 
 which was just as it was the day he left it. 
 
 &quot; There is not another such room in the college as 
 his, said one of his classmates with tears. I could not 
 help loving the dear boys as they would come and look 
 sadly in, and tell us one thing and another that they 
 remembered of him. He was always talking of his 
 home and his sisters, said one. The very day he died 
 he was so happy because I had returned, and he was 
 expecting soon to go home and meet me. He died 
 with that dear thought in his heart. 
 
 &quot; There was a beautiful lane leading down through a 
 charming glen to the river. It had been for years the 
 bathing-place of the students, and into the pure, clear 
 water he plunged, little dreaming that he was never to 
 come out alive. 
 
 &quot; In the evening we went down to see the boating 
 club of which he was a member. He was so happy in 
 

<page 359>
320 THE MINISTER S WOOING. 
 
 this boating club. They had a beautiful boat called 
 the Una, and a uniform, and he enjoyed it so much. 
 
 &quot; This evening all the different crews were out ; but 
 Henry s had their flag furled, and tied with black crape. 
 I felt such love to the dear boys, all of them, because 
 they loved Henry, that it did not pain me as it other 
 wise would. They were glad to see us there, and I was 
 glad that we could be there. Yet right above where 
 their boats were gliding in the evening light lay the 
 bend in the river, clear, still, beautiful, fringed with 
 overhanging pines, from whence our boy went upward 
 to heaven. To heaven if earnest, manly purpose, if 
 sincere, deliberate strife with besetting sin is accepted 
 of God, as I firmly believe it is. Our dear boy was 
 but a beginner in the right way. Had he lived, we had 
 hoped to see all wrong gradually fall from his soul as 
 the worn-out calyx drops from the perfected flower. 
 But Christ has taken him into his own teaching. 
 
 &quot; And one view of Jesus as He is, 
 Will strike all sin forever dead. 
 
 &quot; Since. I wrote to you last we have had anniversary 
 meetings, and with all the usual bustle and care, oiir 
 house full of company. Tuesday we received a beauti 
 ful portrait of our dear Henry, life-size, and as perfect 
 almost as life. It has just that half -roguish, half -loving 
 expression with which he would look at me sometimes, 
 when I would come and brush back his hair and look 
 into his eyes. Every time I go in or out of the room, 
 it seems to give so bright a smile that I almost think 
 that a spirit dwells within it. 
 
 &quot; When I am so heavy, so weary, and go about as if 
 I were wearing an arrow that had pierced my heart, I 
 

<page 360>
THE CELESTIAL GARDENER. 321 
 
 sometimes look up, and this smile seems to say, 6 Mother, 
 patience, I am happy. In our Father s house are many 
 mansions. Sometimes I think I am like a gardener 
 who has planted the seed of some rare exotic. He 
 watches as the two little points of green leaf first spring 
 above the soil. He shifts it from soil to soil, from pot 
 to pot. He watches it, waters it, saves it through thou 
 sands of mischiefs and accidents. He counts every leaf, 
 and marks the strengthening of the stem, till at last the 
 blossom bud was fully formed. What curiosity, what 
 eagerness, what expectation what longing now to 
 see the mystery unfold in the new flower. 
 
 &quot; Just as the calyx begins to divide and a faint streak 
 of color becomes visible, lo ! in one night the owner 
 of the greenhouse sends and takes it away. He does 
 not consult me, he gives me no warning ; he silently 
 takes it and I look, but it is no more. What, then ? 
 Do I suppose he has destroyed the flower? Far from, 
 it ; I know that he has taken it to his own garden., 
 What Henry might have been I could guess better thaa 
 any one. What Henry is, is known to Jesus gnly.&quot; 
 
 Shortly after this time Mrs. Stowe wrote to her sister 
 Catherine : 
 
 If ever I was conscious of an attack of the Devil try 
 ing to separate me from the love of Christ, it was for 
 some days after the terrible news came. I was in a 
 state of great physical weakness, most agonizing, and 
 unable to control my thoughts. Distressing doubts as 
 to Henry s spiritual state were rudely thrust upon my 
 soul. It was as if a voice had said to me : &quot; You 
 trusted in God, did you? You believed that He loved 
 

<page 361>
322 THE MINISTER S WOOING. 
 
 you ! You had perfect confidence that he would never 
 take your child till the work of grace was mature ! 
 Now He has hurried him into eternity without a mo 
 ment s warning, without preparation, and where is he ? &quot; 
 
 I saw at last that these thoughts were irrational, and 
 contradicted the calm, settled belief of my better mo 
 ments, and that they were dishonorable to God, and 
 that it was my duty to resist them, and to assume and 
 steadily maintain that Jesus in love had taken my dear 
 one to his bosom. Since then the Enemy has left me 
 in peace. 
 
 It is our duty to assume that a thing which would 
 be in its very nature unkind, ungenerous, and unfair 
 has not been done. What should we think of the 
 crime of that human being who should take a young 
 mind from circumstances where it was progressing in 
 virtue, and throw it recklessly into corrupting and 
 depraving society? Particularly if it were the child 
 of one who had trusted and confided in Him for years. 
 No ! no such slander as this shall the Devil ever 
 fix in my mind against my Lord and my God ! He 
 who made me capable of such an absorbing, unselfish 
 devotion for my children, so that I would sacrifice my 
 eternal salvation for them, He certainly did not make 
 me capable of more love, more disinterestedness than 
 He has himself. He invented mothers hearts, and He 
 certainly has the pattern in his own, and my poor, weak 
 rush-light of love is enough to show me that some 
 things can and some things cannot be done. Mr. Stowe 
 said in his sermon last Sunday that the mysteries of 
 God s ways with us must be swallowed up by the greater 
 mystery of the love of Christ, even as Aaron s rod swal 
 lowed up the rods of the magicians.

EARTH S LAST EESTING-PLACE. 323 
 
 Papa and mamma are here, and we have been read

 It is glorious, beautiful ; but more of this anon. 
 
 Your affectionate sister, HATTIE. 
 
 ANDOVER, August 24, 1857. 
 
 DEAR CHILDREN, Since anniversary papa and I 
 have been living at home ; Grandpa and Grandma 
 Beecher are here also, and we have had much comfort 
 in their society. . . . To-night the last sad duty is 
 before us. The body is to be removed from the receiv 
 ing tomb in the Old South Churchyard, and laid in the 
 graveyard near by. Pearson has been at work for a 
 week on a lot that is to be thenceforth ours. 
 
 &quot; Our just inheritance consecrated by his grave .&quot; 
 
 How little he thought, wandering there as he often has 
 with us, that his mortal form would so soon be resting 
 there. Yet that was written for him. It was as cer 
 tain then as now, and the hour and place of our death 
 is equally certain, though we know it not. 
 
 It seems selfish that I should yearn to lie down by 
 his side, but I never knew how much I loved him till 
 now. 
 
 The one lost piece of silver seems more than all the 
 rest, the one lost sheep dearer than all the fold, 
 and I so long for one word, one look, one last em 
 brace. . . . 
 
 ANDOVER, September 1, 1857. 
 
 MY DARLING CHILDREN, I must not allow a week 
 to pass without sending a line to you. . . . Our home 
 never looked lovelier. I never saw Andover look so 
 

<page 363>
324 THE MINISTER S WOOING. 
 
 beautiful ; the trees so green, the foliage so rich. 
 Papa and I are just starting to spend a week in Bruns 
 wick, for I am so miserable so weak the least 
 exertion fatigues me, and much of my time I feel a 
 heavy languor, indifferent to everything. I know 
 nothing is so likely to bring me up as the air of the 
 seaside. ... I have set many flowers around Henry s 
 grave, which are blossoming; pansies, white immor 
 telle, white petunia, and verbenas. Papa walks there 
 every day, often twice or three times. The lot has 
 been rolled and planted with fine grass, which is already 
 up and looks green and soft as velvet, and the little 
 birds gather about it. To-night as I sat there the sky 
 was so beautiful, all rosy, with the silver moon looking 
 out of it. Papa said with a deep sigh, &quot; I am submis 
 sive, but not reconciled.&quot; 
 
 BRUNSWICK, September 6, 1857. 
 
 MY DEAR GIRLS, Papa and I have been here for 
 four or five days past. We both of us felt so unwell 
 that we thought we would try the sea air and the dear 
 old scenes of Brunswick. Everything here is just as 
 we left it. We are staying with Mrs. Upham, whose 
 house is as wide, cool, and hospitable as ever. The 
 trees in the yard have grown finely, and Mrs. Upham 
 has cultivated flowers so successfully that the house is 
 all surrounded by them. Everything about the town is 
 the same, even to Miss Gidding s old shop, which is as 
 disorderly as ever, presenting the same medley of tracts, 
 sewing-silk, darning-cotton, and unimaginable old bon 
 nets, which existed there of yore. She has been heard 
 to complain that she can t find things as easily as once. 
 Day before yesterday papa, Charley, and I went down 
 

<page 364>
BRUNSWICK REVISITED. 325 
 
 to Harpswell about seven o clock in the morning. The 
 old spruces and firs look lovely as ever, and I was 
 delighted, as I always used to be, with every step of 
 the way. Old Getchell s mill stands as forlorn as ever 
 in its sandy wastes, and More Brook creeps on glassy 
 and clear beyond. Arriving at Harpswell a glorious 
 hot day, with scarce a breeze to ruffle the water, papa 
 and Charley went to fish for dinners, who soon proved 
 too cunning for them, for they ate every morsel of bait 
 off the hooks, so that out of twenty bites they only 
 secured two or three. What they did get were fried 
 for our dinner, reinforced by a fine clam-chowder. 
 The evening was one of the most glorious I ever saw 
 a calm sea and round, full moon ; Mrs. Upham and 
 I sat out on the rocks between the mainland and the 
 island until ten o clock. I never did see a more per 
 fect and glorious scene, and to add to it there was a 
 splendid northern light dancing like spirits in the sky. 
 Had it not been for a terrible attack of mosquitoes in 
 our sleeping-rooms, that kept us up and fighting all 
 night, we should have called it a perfect success. 
 
 We went into the sea to bathe twice, once the day 
 we came, and about eight o clock in the morning be 
 fore we went back. Besides this we have been to Mid- 
 .dle Bay, where Charley, standing where you all stood 
 before him, actually caught a flounder with his own 
 hand, whereat he screamed loud enough to scare all the 
 folks on Eagle Island. We have also been to Maquoit. 
 We have visited the old pond, and, if I mistake not, the 
 relics of your old raft yet float there ; at all events, one 
 or two fragments of a raft are there, caught among 
 rushes.

 I do not realize that one of the busiest and happiest 
 of the train who once played there shall play there no 
 more. &quot; He shall return to his house no more, neither 
 shall his place know him any more.&quot; I think I have 
 felt the healing touch of Jesus of Nazareth on the deep 
 wound in my heart, for I have golden hours of calm 
 when I say : &quot; Even so, Father, for so it seemed good 
 in thy sight.&quot; So sure am I that the most generous 
 love has ordered all, that I can now take pleasure to 
 give this little proof of my unquestioning confidence in 
 resigning one of my dearest comforts to Him. I feel 
 very near the spirit land, and the words, &quot; I shall go to 
 him, but he shall not return to me,&quot; are very sweet. 
 
 Oh, if God would give to you, my dear children, a 
 view of the infinite beauty of Eternal Love, if He 
 would unite us in himself, then even on earth all tears 
 might be wiped away. 
 
 Papa has preached twice to-day, and is preaching 
 again to-night. He told me to be sure to write and 
 send you his love. I hope his health is getting better. 
 Mrs. Upham sends you her best love, and hopes you 
 will make her a visit some time. 
 
 Good-by, my darlings. Come soon to your affection 
 ate mother. H. B. S. 
 
 The winter of 1857 was passed quietly and unevent 
 fully at Andover. In November Mrs. Stowe contrib 
 uted to the &quot; Atlantic Monthly &quot; a touching little alle 
 gory, &quot; The Mourning Veil.&quot; 
 
 In December, 1858, the first chapter of &quot; The Minis 
 ter s Wooing &quot; appeared in the same magazine. Sim 
 ultaneously with this story was written &quot; The Pearl of 
 

<page 366>
MR. LOWELL ON THE MINISTER S WOOING. 327 
 
 Orr s Island/ published first as a serial in the &quot; Inde 
 pendent.&quot; 
 
 She dictated a large part of &quot;The Minister s Woo 
 ing&quot; under a great pressure of mental excitement, and 
 it was a relief to her to turn to the quiet story of the 
 coast of Maine, which she loved so well. 
 
 In February, 1874, Mrs. Stowe received the follow 
 ing words from Mr. Whittier, which are very interest 
 ing in this connection : &quot; When I am in the mood for 
 thinking deeply I read The Minister s Wooing. But 
 The Pearl of Orr s Island is my favorite. It is the 
 most charming New England idyl ever written.&quot; 
 
 &quot; The Minister s Wooing &quot; was received with univer 
 sal commendation from the first, and called forth the 
 following appreciative words from the pen of Mr. 
 James Russell Lowell : 
 
 &quot;It has always seemed to us that the anti-slavery 
 element in the two former novels by Mrs. Stowe stood 
 in the way of a full appreciation of her remarkable 
 genius, at least in her own country. It was so easy to 
 account for the unexampled popularity of ( Uncle Tom 
 by attributing it to a cheap sympathy with sentimental 
 philanthropy ! As people began to recover from the 
 first enchantment, they began also to resent it and to 
 complain that a dose of that insane Garrison-root which 
 takes the reason prisoner had been palmed upon them 
 without their knowing it, and that their ordinary water- 
 gruel of fiction, thinned with sentiment and thickened 
 with moral, had been hocussed with the bewildering 
 hasheesh of Abolition. We had the advantage of 
 reading that truly extraordinary book for the first time 
 in Paris, long after the whirl of excitement produced by 
 

<page 367>
328 THE MINISTER S WOOING. 
 
 its publication had subsided, in the seclusion of dis 
 tance, and with a judgment unbiased by those political 
 sympathies which it is impossible, perhaps unwise, to 
 avoid at home. We felt then, and we believe now, that 
 the secret of Mrs. Stowe s power lay in that same 
 genius by which the great successes in creative liter 
 ature have always been achieved, the genius that 
 instinctively goes right to the organic elements of 
 human nature, whether under a white skin or a black, 
 and which disregards as trivial the conventional and 
 factitious notions which make so large a part both of 
 our thinking and feeling. Works of imagination writ 
 ten with an aim to immediate impression are commonly 
 ephemeral, like Miss Martineau s Tales, and Elliott s 
 Corn-law Rhymes ; but the creative faculty of Mrs. 
 Stowe, like that of Cervantes in Don Quixote and of 
 Fielding in Joseph Andrews, overpowered the narrow 
 specialty of her design, and expanded a local and tem 
 porary theme with the cosmopolitanism of genius. 
 
 &quot; It is a proverb that There is a great deal of human 
 nature in men, but it is equally and sadly true that there 
 is amazingly little of it in books. Fielding is the only 
 English novelist who deals with life in its broadest 
 sense. Thackeray, his disciple and congener, and Dick 
 ens, the congener of Smollett, do not so much treat of 
 life as of the strata of society ; the one studying nature 
 from the club-room window, the other from the report 
 ers box in the police court. It may be that the gen 
 eral obliteration of distinctions of rank in this country, 
 which is generally considered a detriment to the novel 
 ist, will in the end turn to his advantage by compell 
 ing him to depend for his effects on the contrasts and 
 

<page 368>
MR. LOWELL S CRITICISM. 329 
 
 collisions of innate character, rather than on those shal 
 lower traits superinduced by particular social arrange 
 ments, or by hereditary associations. Shakespeare drew 
 ideal, and Fielding natural men and women ; Thack 
 eray draws either gentlemen or snobs, and Dickens 
 either unnatural men or the oddities natural only in the 
 lowest grades of a highly artificial system of society. 
 The first two knew human nature ; of the two latter, 
 one knows what is called the world, and the other the 
 streets of London. Is it possible that the very social 
 democracy which here robs the novelist of so much 
 romance, so much costume, so much antithesis of caste, 
 so much in short that is purely external, will give him 
 a set-off in making it easier for him to get at that ele 
 ment of universal humanity which neither of the two 
 extremes of an aristocratic system, nor the salient and 
 picturesque points of contrast between the two, can 
 alone lay open to him ? 
 
 &quot; We hope to see this problem solved by Mrs. Stowe. 
 That kind of romantic interest which Scott evolved 
 from the relations of lord and vassal, of thief and clans 
 man, from the social more than the moral contrast of 
 Roundhead and Cavalier, of far-descended pauper and 
 nouveau riche which Cooper found in the clash of sav 
 agery with civilization, and the shaggy virtue bred on 
 the border-land between the two, Indian by habit, white 
 by tradition, Mrs. Stowe seems in her former novels to 
 have sought in a form of society alien to her sympa 
 thies, and too remote for exact study, or for the acquire 
 ment of that local truth which is the slow result of 
 unconscious observation. There can be no stronger 
 proof of the greatness of her genius, of her possessing 
 

<page 369>
330 THE MINISTER S WOOING. 
 
 that conceptive faculty which belongs to the higher 
 order of imagination, than the avidity with which 
 Uncle Tom was read at the South. It settled the 
 point that this book was true to human nature, even if 
 not minutely so to plantation life. 
 
 &quot; If capable of so great a triumph where success must 
 so largely depend on the sympathetic insight of her 
 mere creative power, have we not a right to expect 
 something far more in keeping with the requirements of 
 art, now that her wonderful eye is to be the mirror of 
 familiar scenes, and of a society in which she was bred, 
 of which she has seen so many varieties, and that, too, 
 in the country, where it is most naive and original ? 
 It is a great satisfaction to us that in &amp;lt; The Minister s 
 Wooing she has chosen her time and laid her scene 
 amid New England habits and traditions. There is no 
 other writer who is so capable of perpetuating for us, in 
 a work of art, a style of thought and manners which 
 railways and newspapers will soon render as palaeozoic 
 as the mastodon or the megalosaurians. Thus far the 
 story has fully justified our hopes. The leading char 
 acters are all fresh and individual creations. Mrs. 
 Kate Scudder, the notable Yankee housewife ; Mary, in 
 whom Cupid is to try conclusions with Calvin ; James 
 Marvyn, the adventurous boy of the coast, in whose 
 heart the wild religion of nature swells till the strait 
 swathings of Puritanism are burst ; Dr. Hopkins, the 
 conscientious minister come upon a time when the social 
 prestige of the clergy is waning, and whose independ 
 ence will test the voluntary system of ministerial sup 
 port ; Simeon Brown, the man of theological dialectics, 
 in whom the utmost perfection of creed is shown to be 
 

<page 370>
MR. LOWELL S CRITICISM. 331 
 
 not inconsistent with the most contradictory imperfec 
 tion of life, all these are characters new to literature. 
 And the scene is laid just far enough away in point of 
 time to give proper tone and perspective. 
 
 &quot; We think we find in the story, so far as it has pro 
 ceeded, the promise of an interest as unhackneyed as it 
 will be intense. There is room for the play of all the 
 passions and interests that make up the great tragi 
 comedy of life, while all the scenery and accessories 
 will be those which familiarity has made dear to us. 
 We are a little afraid of Colonel Burr, to be sure, it is 
 so hard to make a historical personage fulfill the condi 
 tions demanded by the novel of every-day life. He is 
 almost sure either to fall below our traditional concep 
 tion of him, or to rise above the natural and easy level 
 of character, into the vague or the melodramatic. More 
 over, w,e do not want a novel of society from Mrs. 
 Stowe ; she is quite too good to be wasted in that way, 
 and her tread is much more firm on the turf of the 
 &quot; door-yard &quot; or the pasture, and the sanded floor of 
 the farmhouse, than on the velvet of the salon. We 
 have no notion how she is to develop her plot, but we 
 think we foresee chances for her best power in the 
 struggle which seems foreshadowed between Mary s 
 conscientious admiration of the doctor and her half- 
 conscious passion for James, before she discovers that 
 one of these conflicting feelings means simply moral 
 liking and approval, and the other that she is a woman 
 and that she loves. And is not the value of dogmatic 
 theology as a rule of life to be thoroughly tested for 
 the doctor by his slave-trading parishioners ? Is he not 
 to learn the bitter difference between intellectual accept- 
 

<page 371>
332 THE MINISTERS WOOING. 
 
 ance of a creed and that true partaking of the sacra 
 ment of love and faith and sorrow that makes Christ 
 the very life-blood of our being and doing ? And has 
 not James Marvyn also his lesson to be taught ? We 
 foresee him drawn gradually back by Mary from his 
 recoil against Puritan formalism to a perception of how 
 every creed is pliant and plastic to a beautiful nature, 
 of how much charm there may be in an hereditary 
 faith, even if it have become almost conventional. 
 
 &quot; In the materials of character already present in the 
 story, there is scope for Mrs. Stowe s humor, pathos, 
 clear moral sense, and quick eye for the scenery of life. 
 We do not believe that there is any one who, by birth, 
 breeding, and natural capacity, has had the opportunity 
 to know New England so well as she, or who has the 
 peculiar genius so to profit by the knowledge. Already 
 there have been scenes in * The Minister s Wooing 
 that, in their lowness of tone and quiet truth, contrast 
 as charmingly with the humid vagueness of the modern 
 school of novel-writers as The Vicar of Wakefield 
 itself, and we are greatly mistaken if it do not prove to 
 be the most characteristic of Mrs. Stowe s works, and 
 therefore that on which her fame will chiefly rest with 
 posterity.&quot; 
 
 &quot; The Minister s Wooing &quot; was not completed as a 
 serial till December, 1859. Long before its comple 
 tion Mrs. Stowe received letters from many interested 
 readers, who were as much concerned for the future of 
 her &quot;spiritual children,&quot; as George Eliot would call 
 them, as if they had been flesh and blood. 
 
 The following letter from Mr. Lowell is given as the 
 most valuable received by Mrs. Stowe at this time : 
 

<page 372>
A LETTER FROM MR. LOWELL. 333 
 
 CAMBRIDGE, February 4, 1859. 
 
 MY DEAR MRS. STOWE, I certainly did mean to 
 write you about your story, but only to cry bravissima ! 
 with the rest of the world. I intended no kind of 
 criticism ; deeming it wholly out of place, and in the 
 nature of a wet-blanket, so long as a story is unfinished. 
 When I got the first number in MS., I said to Mr. Phil 
 lips that I thought it would be the best thing you had 
 done, and what followed has only confirmed my first 
 judgment. From long habit, and from the tendency 
 of my studies, I cannot help looking at things purely 
 from an aesthetic point of view, and what / valued in 
 &quot; Uncle Tom &quot; was the genius, and not the moral. 
 That is saying a good deal, for I never use the word 
 genius at haphazard, and always (perhaps, too) spar 
 ingly. I am going to be as frank as I ought to be 
 with one whom I value so highly. What especially 
 charmed me in the new story was, that you had taken 
 your stand on New England ground. You are one of 
 the few persons lucky enough to be born with eyes in 
 your head, that is, with something behind the eyes 
 which makes them of value. To most people the see 
 ing apparatus is as useless as the great telescope at the 
 observatory is to me, something to stare through with 
 no intelligent result. Nothing could be better than 
 the conception of your plot (so far as I divine it), and 
 the painting-in of your figures. As for &quot; theology,&quot; 
 it is as much a part of daily life in New England as in 
 Scotland, and all I should have to say about it is this : 
 let it crop out when it naturally comes to the surface, 
 only don t dig down to it. A moral aim is a fine thing, 
 but in making a story an artist is a traitor who does 
 

<page 373>
334 THE MINISTER S WOOING. 
 
 not sacrifice everything to art. Remember the lesson 
 that Christ gave us twice over. First, he preferred the 
 useless Mary to the dish-washing Martha, and next, 
 when that exemplary moralist and friend of humanity, 
 Judas, objected to the sinful waste of the Magdalen s 
 ointment, the great Teacher would rather it should be 
 wasted in an act of simple beauty than utilized for the 
 benefit of the poor. Cleopatra was an artist when she 
 dissolved her biggest pearl to captivate her Antony- 
 public. May I, a critic by profession, say the whole 
 truth to a woman of genius ? Yes ? And never be 
 forgiven ? I shall try, and try to be forgiven, too. In 
 the first place, pay no regard to the advice of anybody. 
 In the second place, pay a great deal to mine ! A Kil 
 kenny-cattish style of advice ? Not at all. My advice is 
 to follow your own instincts, to stick to nature, and 
 to avoid what people commonly call the &quot; Ideal ; &quot; for 
 that, and beauty, and pathos, and success, all lie in the 
 simply natural. We all preach it, from Wordsworth 
 down, and we all, from Wordsworth down, don t prac 
 tice it. Don t I feel it every day in this weary editorial 
 mill of mine, that there are ten thousand people who 
 can write &quot; ideal &quot; things for one who can see, and feel, 
 and reproduce nature and character ? Ten thousand, 
 did I say ? Nay, ten million. What made Shake 
 speare so great ? Nothing but eyes and faith in 
 them. The same is true of Thackeray. I see nowhere 
 more often than in authors the truth that men love 
 their opposites. Dickens insists on being tragic and 
 makes shipwreck. 
 
 I always thought (forgive me) that the Hebrew parts 
 of &quot; Dred &quot; were a mistake. Do not think me imper- 
 

<page 374>
MR. LOWELL S LETTER. 335 
 
 tinent ; I am only honestly anxious that what I con 
 sider a very remarkable genius should have faith in 
 itself. Let your moral take care of itself, and remem 
 ber that an author s writing-desk is something infinitely 
 higher than a pulpit. What I call &quot; care of itself &quot; is 
 shown in that noble passage in the February number 
 about the ladder up to heaven. That is grand preach 
 ing and in the right way. I am sure that &quot; The Minis 
 ter s Wooing &quot; is going to be the best of your products 
 hitherto, and I am sure of it because you show so 
 thorough a mastery of your material, so true a percep 
 tion of realities, without which the ideality is im 
 possible. 
 
 As for &quot; orthodoxy,&quot; be at ease. Whatever is well 
 done the world finds orthodox at last, in spite of all 
 the Fakir journals, whose only notion of orthodoxy 
 seems to be the power of standing in one position till 
 you lose all the use of your limbs. If, with your heart 
 and brain, you are not orthodox, in Heaven s name who 
 is ? If you mean &quot; Calvinistic,&quot; no woman could ever 
 be such, for Calvinism is logic, and no woman worth 
 the name could ever live by syllogisms. Woman 
 charms a higher faculty in us than reason, God be 
 praised, and nothing has delighted me more in your new 
 story than the happy instinct with which you develop 
 this incapacity of the lovers logic in your female char 
 acters. Go on just as you have begun, and make it 
 appear in as many ways as you like, that, whatever 
 creed may be true, it is not true and never will be that 
 man can be saved by machinery. I can speak with 
 some chance of being right, for I confess a strong 
 sympathy with many parts of Calvinistic theology, and, 
 

<page 375>
336 THE MINISTER S WOOING. 
 
 for one thing, believe in hell with all my might, and in 
 the goodness of God for all that. 
 
 I have not said anything. What could I say ? One 
 might almost as well advise a mother about the child 
 she still bears under her heart, and say, give it these 
 and those qualities, as an author about a work yet in 
 the brain. 
 
 Only this I will say, that I am honestly delighted 
 with &quot; The Minister s Wooing ; &quot; that reading it has 
 been one of my few editorial pleasures ; that no one 
 appreciates your genius more highly than I, or hopes 
 more fervently that you will let yourself go without re 
 gard to this, that, or t other. Don t read any criticisms 
 on your story : believe that you know better than any 
 of us, and be sure that everybody likes it. That I 
 know. There is not, and never was, anybody so com 
 petent to write a true New England poem as yourself, 
 and have no doubt that you are doing it. The native 
 sod sends up the best inspiration to the brain, and you 
 are as sure of immortality as we all are of dying, if 
 you only go on with entire faith in yourself. 
 
 Faithfully and admiringly yours, 
 
 J. R. LOWELL. 
 
 After the book was published in England, Mr. Rus- 
 kin wrote to Mrs. Stowe : 
 
 &quot; Well, I have read the book now, and I think noth 
 ing can be nobler than the noble parts of it (Mary s 
 great speech to Colonel Burr, for instance), nothing 
 wiser than the wise parts of it (the author s parenthet 
 ical and under-breath remarks), nothing more delight 
 ful than the delightful parts (all that Virginie says and 
 

<page 376>
LETTER FROM MR. RUSKIN. 337 
 
 does), nothing more edged than the edged parts (Can- 
 dace s sayings and doings, to wit) ; but I do not like the 
 plan of the whole, because the simplicity of the minister 
 seems to diminish the probability of Mary s reverence 
 for him. I cannot fancy even so good a girl who would 
 not have laughed at him. Nor can I fancy a man of 
 real intellect reaching such a period of life without 
 understanding his own feelings better, or penetrating 
 those of another more quickly. 
 
 &quot; Then I am provoked at nothing happening to Mrs. 
 Scudder, whom I think as entirely unendurable a crea 
 ture as ever defied poetical justice at the end of a novel 
 meant to irritate people. And finally, I think you are 
 too disdainful of what ordinary readers seek in a novel, 
 under the name of ( interest, that gradually develop 
 ing wonder, expectation, and curiosity which makes 
 people who have no self-command sit up till three in 
 the morning to get to the crisis, and people who have 
 self-command lay the book down with a resolute sigh, 
 and think of it all the next day through till the time 
 comes for taking it up again. Still, I know well that 
 in many respects it was impossible for you to treat this 
 story merely as a work of literary art. There must 
 have been many facts which you could not dwell upon, 
 and which no one may judge by common rules. 
 
 &quot;It is also true, as you say once or twice in the 
 course of the work, that we have not among us here 
 the peculiar religious earnestness you have mainly to 
 describe. 
 
 &quot; We have little earnest formalism, and our formalists 
 are for the most part hollow, feeble, uninteresting, mere 
 stumbling-blocks. We have the Simeon Brown species, 
 

<page 377>
338 THE MINISTERS WOOING. 
 
 indeed ; and among readers even of his kind the book 
 may do some good, and more among the weaker, truer 
 people, whom it will shake like mattresses, making 
 the dust fly, and perhaps with it some of the sticks and 
 quill-ends, which often make that kind of person an 
 objectionable mattress. I write too lightly of the book, 
 far too lightly, but your letter made me gay, and 
 I have been lighter-hearted ever since ; only I kept this 
 after beginning it, because I was ashamed to send it 
 without a line to Mrs. Browning as well. I do not 
 understand why you should apprehend (or rather antici 
 pate without apprehension) any absurd criticism on it. 
 It is sure to be a popular book, not as Uncle Tom 
 was, for that owed part of its popularity to its dramatic 
 effect (the flight on the ice, etc.), which I did not like ; 
 but as a true picture of human life is always popular. 
 Nor, I should think, would any critics venture at all to 
 carp at it. 
 
 &quot; The Candace and Yirginie bits appear to me, as far 
 as I have yet seen, the best. I am very glad there is 
 this nice French lady in it : the French are the least 
 appreciated in general, of all nations, by other nations. 
 . . . My father says the book is worth its weight in 
 gold, and he knows good work.&quot; 
 
 When we turn from these criticisms and commenda 
 tions to the inner history of this period, we find that 
 the work was done in deep sadness of heart, and the 
 undertone of pathos that forms the dark background 
 of the brightest and most humorous parts of &quot; The 
 Minister s Wooing &quot; was the unconscious revelation of 
 one of sorrowful spirit, who, weary of life, would have 
 

<page 378>
LETTER TO LADY BYRON. 339 
 
 been glad to lie down with her arms &quot; round the way 
 side cross, and sleep away into a brighter scene.&quot; 
 
 Just before beginning the writing of &quot;The Minis 
 ter s Wooing &quot; she sent the following letter to Lady 
 
 Byron : 
 
 ANDOVER, June 30, 1858. 
 
 MY DEAR FRIEND, I did long to hear from you 
 at a time when few knew how to speak, because I knew 
 that you did know everything that sorrow can teach, 
 you whose whole life has been a crucifixion, a long 
 ordeal. But I believe that the &quot; Lamb,&quot; who stands 
 forever in the midst of the throne &quot; as it had been 
 slain,&quot; has everywhere his followers, those who are sent 
 into the world, as he was, to suffer for the redemption 
 of others, and like him they must look to the joy set 
 before them of redeeming others. 
 
 I often think that God called you to this beautiful 
 and terrible ministry when He suffered you to link 
 your destiny with one so strangely gifted, so fearfully 
 tempted, and that the reward which is to meet you, 
 when you enter within the veil, where you must soon 
 pass, will be to see the angel, once chained and defiled 
 within him, set free from sin and glorified, and so know 
 that to you it has been given, by your life of love and 
 faith, to accomplish this glorious change. 
 
 I think very much on the subject on which you con 
 versed with me once, the future state of retribution. 
 It is evident to me that the spirit of Christianity has 
 produced in the human spirit a tenderness of love which 
 wholly revolts from the old doctrine on the subject, and 
 I observe the more Christ-like any one becomes, the 
 more impossible it seems for him to accept it ; and yet, 
 

<page 379>
340 THE MINISTER S WOOING. 
 
 on the contrary, it was Christ who said, &quot; Fear Him 
 that is able to destroy soul and body in hell,&quot; and the 
 most appalling language on this subject is that of Christ 
 himself. Certain ideas once prevalent certainly must 
 be thrown off. An endless infliction for past sins was 
 once the doctrine that we now generally reject. The 
 doctrine as now taught is that of an eternal persistence 
 in evil necessitating eternal punishment, since evil in 
 duces misery by an eternal nature of things, and this, 
 I fear, is inferable from the analogies of nature, and 
 confirmed by the whole implication of the Bible. 
 
 Is there any fair way of disposing of the current of 
 assertion, and the still deeper undercurrent of implica 
 tion, on this subject, without one which loosens all faith 
 in revelation, and throws us on pure naturalism ? But 
 of one thing I am sure, probation does not end with 
 this life, and the number of the redeemed may there 
 fore be infinitely greater than the world s history leads 
 us to suppose. 
 
 The views expressed in this letter certainly throw 
 light on many passages in &quot; The Minister s Wooing.&quot; 
 
 The following letter, written to her daughter Georgi- 
 ana, is introduced as revealing the spirit in which much 
 of &quot; The Minister s Wooing &quot; was written : 
 
 February 12, 1859. 
 
 MY DEAR GEORGIE, Why have n t I written ? Be 
 cause, dear Georgie, I am like the dry, dead, leafless 
 tree, and have only cold, dead, slumbering buds of hope 
 on the end of stiff, hard, frozen twigs of thought, but 
 no leaves, no blossoms ; nothing to send to a little girl 
 

<page 380>
SHADOWS. 341 
 
 who does n t know what to do with herself any more 
 than a kitten. I am cold, weary, dead ; everything is 
 a burden to me. 
 
 I let my plants die by inches before my eyes, and do 
 not water them, and I dread everything I do, and wish 
 it was not to be done, and so when I get a letter from 
 my little girl I smile and say, &quot; Dear little puss, I will 
 answer it ; &quot; and I sit hour after hour with folded hands, 
 looking at the inkstand and dreading to begin. The 
 fact is, pussy, mamma is tired. Life to you is gay and 
 joyous, but to mamma it has been a battle in which the 
 spirit is willing but the flesh weak, and she would be 
 glad, like the woman in the St. Bernard, to he down 
 with her arms around the wayside cross, and sleep away 
 into a brighter scene. Henry s fair, sweet face looks 
 down upon me now and then from out a cloud, and I 
 feel again all the bitterness of the eternal &quot; No &quot; which 
 says I must never, never, in this life, see that face, lean 
 on that arm, hear that voice. Not that my faith in God 
 in the least fails, and that I do not believe that all this 
 is for good. I do, and though not happy, I am blessed. 
 Weak, weary as I am, I rest on Jesus in the innermost 
 depth of my soul, and am quite sure that there is com 
 ing an inconceivable hour of beauty and glory when I 
 shall regain Jesus, and he will give me back my beloved 
 one, whom he is educating in a far higher sphere than 
 I proposed. So do not mistake me, only know that 
 mamma is sitting weary by the wayside, feeling weak 
 and worn, but in no sense discouraged. 
 
 Your affectionate mother, 
 
 H. B. S.

 So is it ever : when with bold step we press our way 
 into the holy place where genius hath wrought, we find 
 it to be a place of sorrows. Art has its Gethsemane 
 and its Calvary as well as religion. Our best loved 
 books and sweetest songs are those &quot; that tell of sad 
 dest thought.&quot; 
 
 The summer of 1859 found Mrs. Stowe again on her 
 way to Europe, this time accompanied by all her chil 
 dren except the youngest.

 LETTERS TO DR. HOLMES. 
 
 MRS. STOWE S third and last trip to Europe was un 
 dertaken in the sujnmer of 1859. In writing to Lady 
 Byron in May of that year, she says : &quot; I am at present 
 writing something that interests me greatly, and may 
 interest you, as an attempt to portray the heart and life 
 of New England, its religion, theology, and manners. 
 Sampson Low & Son are issuing it in numbers,- and I 
 should be glad to know how they strike you. It is to 
 publish this work complete that I intend to visit Eng 
 land this summer.&quot; 
 
 The story thus referred to was &quot; The Minister s Woo 
 ing,&quot; and Lady Byron s answer to the above, which is 
 appended, leaves no room for doubt as to her apprecia 
 tion of it. She writes : 
 
 LONDON, May 31, 1859. 
 
 DEAR FRIEND, I have found, particularly as to 
 yourself, that if I did not answer from the first impulse, 
 all had evaporated. Your letter came by the Niagara, 
 which brought Fanny Kemble, to learn the loss of her 
 best friend, that Miss Fitzhugh whom you saw at my 
 house. 
 

<page 383>
344 THE THIRD TRIP TO EUROPE. 
 
 I have an intense interest in your new novel. More 
 power in these few numbers than in any of your former 
 writings, relatively, at least to my own mind. More 
 power than in &quot; Adam Bede,&quot; which is the book of the 
 season, and well deserves a high place. Whether Mrs. 
 Scudder will rival Mrs. Poyser, we shall see. 
 
 It would amuse you to hear my granddaughter and 
 myself attempting to foresee the future of the &quot; love 
 story,&quot; being quite persuaded for the moment that James 
 is at sea, and the minister about to ruin himself. We 
 think that she will labor to be in love with the self- 
 devoting man, under her mother s influence, and from 
 that hyper-conscientiousness so common with good girls, 
 but we don t wish her to succeed. Then what is to 
 become of her older lover ? He Time will show. I 
 have just missed Dale Owen, with whom I wished to 
 have conversed about the &quot; Spiritualism.&quot; Harris is 
 lecturing here on religion. I do not hear him praised. 
 People are looking for helps to believe everywhere but 
 in life, in music, in architecture, in antiquity, in cer 
 emony, and upon all is written, &quot; Thou shalt not 
 believe.&quot; At least, if this be faith, happier the unbe 
 liever. I am willing to see through that materialism, 
 but if I am to rest there, I would rend the veil. 
 
 June 1. The day of the packet s sailing. I shall 
 hope to be visited by you here. The best flowers sent 
 me have been placed in your little vases, giving life, as 
 it were, to the remembrance of you, though not to pass 
 away like them. 
 
 Ever yours, 
 
 A. T. NOEL BYRON.

THE VOYAGE TO ENGLAND. 345 
 
 The entire family, with the exception of the youngest 
 son, was abroad at this time. The two eldest daughters 
 were in Paris, having previously sailed for Havre in 
 March, in company with their cousin, Miss Beecher. 
 On their arrival in Paris, they went directly to the 
 house of their old friend, Madame Borione, and soon 
 afterwards entered a Protestant school. The rest of 
 the family, including Mrs. Stowe, her husband and 
 youngest daughter, sailed for Liverpool early in Au 
 gust. At about the same time, Fred Stowe, in com 
 pany with his friend Samuel Scoville, took passage for 
 the same port in a sailing vessel. A comprehensive 
 outline of the earlier portion of this foreign tour is 
 given in the following letter written by Professor Stowe 
 to the sole member of the family remaining in America : 
 
 CASTLE CHILLON, SWITZERLAND, September 1, 1859. 
 
 DEAR LITTLE CHARLEY, We are all here except 
 Fred, and all well. We have had a most interesting 
 journey, of which I must give a brief account. 
 
 We sailed from New York in the steamer Asia, on 
 the 3d of August [1859], a very hot day, and for ten 
 days it was the hottest weather I ever knew at sea. 
 We had a splendid ship s company, mostly foreigners, 
 Italians, Spaniards, with a sprinkling of Scotch and 
 Irish. We passed one big iceberg in the night close to, 
 and as the iceberg would n t turn out for us we turned 
 out for the iceberg, and were very glad to come off so. 
 This was the night of the 9th of August, and after 
 that we had cooler weather, and on the morning of the 
 13th the wind blew like all possessed, and so con 
 tinued till afternoon. Sunday morning, the 14th, we 
 

<page 385>
346 THE THIRD TRIP TO EUROPE. 
 
 got safe into Liverpool, landed, and went to the Adel- 
 phi Hotel. Mamma and Georgie were only a little 
 sick on the way over, and that was the morning of the 
 13th. 
 
 As it was court time, the high sheriff of Lancashire, 
 Sir Robert Gerauld, a fine, stout, old, gray-haired John 
 Bull, came thundering up to the hotel at noon in his 
 grand coach with six beautiful horses with outriders, 
 and two trumpeters, and twelve men with javelins for a 
 guard, all dressed in the gayest manner, and rushing 
 along like Time in the primer, the trumpeters too-ti-toot- 
 tooing like a house a-fire, and how I wished my little 
 Charley had been there to see it ! 
 
 Monday we wanted to go and see the court, so we 
 went over to St. George s Hall, a most magnificent 
 structure, that beats the Boston State House all hollow, 
 and Sir Robert Gerauld himself met us, and said he 
 would get us a good place. So he took us away round 
 a narrow, crooked passage, and opened a little door, 
 where we saw nothing but a great, crimson curtain, 
 which he told us to put aside and go straight on ; and 
 where do you think we all found ourselves ? 
 
 Right on the platform with the judges in their big 
 wigs and long robes, and facing the whole crowded 
 court ! It was enough to frighten a body into fits, but 
 we took it quietly as we could, and your mamma looked 
 as meek as Moses in her little, battered straw hat and 
 gray cloak, seeming to say, &quot; I did n t come here o 
 purpose.&quot; 
 
 That same night we arrived in London, and Tuesday 
 (August 16th), riding over the city, we called at Stafford 
 House, and inquired if the Duchess of Sutherland was 
 

<page 386>
MEETING OLD FRIENDS. 347 
 
 there. A servant came out and said the duchess was 
 in and would be very glad to see us ; so your mamma, 
 Georgie, and I went walking up the magnificent stair 
 case in the entrance hall, and the great, noble, bril 
 liant duchess came sailing down the stairs to meet 
 us, in her white morning dress (for it was only four 
 o clock in the afternoon, and she was not yet dressed 
 for dinner), took your mamma into her great bosom, 
 and folded her up till the little Yankee woman looked 
 like a small gray kitten half covered in a snowbank, 
 and kissed and kissed her, and then she took up little 
 Georgie and kissed her, and then she took my hand, 
 and did n t kiss me. 
 
 Next day we went to the duchess s villa, near Wind 
 sor Castle, and had a grand time riding round the park, 
 sailing on the Thames, and eating the very best dinner 
 that was ever set on a table. 
 
 We stayed in London till the 25th of August, and 
 then went to Paris and found H. and E. and H. B. 
 all well and happy ; and on the 30th of August we all 
 went to Geneva together, and to-day, the 1st of Sep 
 tember, we all took a sail up the beautiful Lake Leman 
 here in the midst of the Alps, close by the old castle 
 of Chillon, about which Lord Byron has written a poem. 
 In a day or two we shah 1 go to Chamouni, and then 
 Georgie and I will go back to Paris and London, and 
 so home at the time appointed. Until then I remain 
 as ever, Your loving father, 
 
 C. E. STOWE. 
 
 Mrs. Stowe accompanied her husband and daughter 
 to England, where, after traveling and visiting for two 
 

<page 387>
348 THE THIRD TRIP TO EUROPE. 
 
 weeks, she bade them good-by and returned to her 
 daughters in Switzerland. From Lausanne she writes 
 under date of October 9th : 
 
 MY DEAR HUSBAND, Here we are at Lausanne, in 
 the Hotel Gibbon, occupying the very parlor that the 
 Ruskins had when we were here before. The day I 
 left you I progressed prosperously to Paris. Beached 
 there about one o clock at night ; could get no carriage, 
 and finally had to turn in at a little hotel close by the 
 station, where I slept till morning. I could not but 
 think what if anything should happen to me there ? No 
 body knew me or where I was, but the bed was clean, 
 the room respectable ; so I locked my door and slept, 
 then took a carriage in the morning, and found Madame 
 Borione at breakfast. I write to-night, that you may 
 get a letter from me at the earliest possible date after 
 your return. 
 
 Instead of coming to Geneva in one day, I stopped 
 over one night at Macon, got to Geneva the next day 
 about four o clock, and to Lausanne at eight. Coming 
 up-stairs and opening the door, I found the whole party 
 seated with their books and embroidery about a centre- 
 table, and looking as homelike and cosy as possible. 
 You may imagine the greetings, the kissing, laughing, 
 and good times generally. 
 
 From Lausanne the merry party traveled toward 
 Florence by easy stages, stopping at Lake Como, Milan, 
 Verona, Venice, Genoa, and Leghorn. At Florence, 
 where they arrived early in November, they met Fred 
 Stowe and his friend, Samuel Scoville, and here they 
 

<page 388>
A CHRISTMAS IN FLORENCE. 349 
 
 were also joined by their Brooklyn friends, the How 
 ards. Thus it was a large and thoroughly congenial 
 party that settled down in the old Italian city to spend 
 the winter. From here Mrs. Stowe wrote weekly letters 
 to her husband in Andover, and among them are the 
 following, that not only throw light upon their mode of 
 life, but illustrate a marked tendency of her mind : 
 
 FLORENCE, Christmas Day, 1859. 
 
 MY DEAR HUSBAND, I wish you all a Merry Christ 
 mas, hoping to spend the next one with you. 
 
 For us, we are expecting to spend this evening with 
 quite a circle of American friends. With Scoville and 
 Fred came L. Bacon (son of Dr. Bacon) ; a Mr. Porter, 
 who is to study theology at Andover, and is now mak 
 ing the tour of Europe ; Mr. Clarke, formerly minister at 
 Cornwall ; Mr. Jenkyns, of Lowell ; Mr. and Mrs. How 
 ard, John and Annie Howard, who came in most unex 
 pectedly upon us last night. So we shall have quite a 
 New England party, and shall sing Millais Christmas 
 hymn in great force. Hope you will all do the same iii 
 the old stone cabin. 
 
 Our parlor is all trimmed with laurel and myrtle, look 
 ing like a great bower, and our mantel and table are 
 redolent with bouquets of orange blossoms and pinks. 
 
 January 16, 1860. 
 
 MY DEAR HUSBAND, Your letter received to-day 
 has raised quite a weight from my mind, for it shows 
 that at last you have received all mine, and that thus 
 the chain of communication between us is unbroken. 
 What you said about your spiritual experiences in feel- 
 

<page 389>
350 THE THIRD TRIP TO EUROPE. 
 
 ing the presence of dear Henry with you, and, above 
 all, the vibration of that mysterious guitar, was very 
 pleasant to me. Since I have been in Florence, I have 
 been distressed by inexpressible yearnings after him, 
 such sighings and outreachings, with a sense of utter 
 darkness and separation, not only from him but from 
 all spiritual communion with my God. But I have be 
 come acquainted with a friend through whom I receive 
 consoling impressions of these things, a Mrs. E., of 
 Boston, a very pious, accomplished, and interesting 
 woman, who has had a history much like yours in rela 
 tion to spiritual manifestations. 
 
 Without doubt she is what the spiritualists would 
 regard as a very powerful medium, but being a very 
 earnest Christian, and afraid of getting led astray, she 
 has kept carefully aloof from all circles and things of 
 that nature. She came and opened her mind to me in 
 the first place, to ask my advice as to what she had bet 
 ter do ; relating experiences very similar to many of 
 yours. 
 
 My advice was substantially to try the spirits whether 
 they were of God, to keep close to the Bible and 
 prayer, and then accept whatever came. But I have 
 found that when I am with her I receive very strong 
 impressions from the spiritual world, so that I feel often 
 sustained and comforted, as if I had been near to my 
 Henry and other departed friends. This has been at 
 times so strong as greatly to soothe and support me. I 
 told her your experiences, in which she was greatly in 
 terested. She said it was so rare to hear of Christian 
 and reliable people with such peculiarities. 
 
 I cannot, however, think that Henry strikes the guitar, 
 

<page 390>
THE UNSEEN WORLD. 351 
 
 that must be Eliza. Her spirit has ever seemed to 
 cling to that mode of manifestation, and if you would 
 keep it in your sleeping-room, no doubt you would hear 
 from it oftener. I have been reading lately a curious 
 work from an old German in Paris who has been mak 
 ing experiments in spirit-writing. He purports to de 
 scribe a series of meetings held in the presence of fifty 
 witnesses, whose names he gives, in which writing has 
 come on paper, without the apparition of hands or any 
 pen or pencil, from various historical people. 
 
 He seems a devout believer in inspiration, and the 
 book is curious for its mixture of all the phenomena, 
 Pagan and Christian, going over Hindoo, Chinese, 
 Greek, and Italian literature for examples, and then 
 bringing similar ones from the Bible. 
 
 One thing I am convinced of, that spiritualism is a 
 reaction from the intense materialism of the present age. 
 Luther, when he recognized a personal devil, was much 
 nearer right. We ought to enter fully, at least, into 
 the spiritualism of the Bible. Circles and spiritual jug 
 glery I regard as the lying signs and wonders, with all 
 deceivableness of unrighteousness ; but there is a real 
 scriptural spiritualism which has fallen into disuse, and 
 must be revived, and there are, doubtless, people who, 
 from some constitutional formation, can more readily 
 receive the impressions of the surrounding spiritual 
 world. Such were apostles, prophets, and workers of 
 miracles. 
 
 Sunday evening. To-day I went down to sit with 
 Mrs. E. in her quiet parlor. We read in Revelation 
 together, and talked of the saints and spirits of the just 
 made perfect, till it seemed, as it always does when with 
 

<page 391>

 her, as if Henry were close by me. Then a curious 
 thing happened. She has a little Florentine guitar 
 which hangs in her parlor, quite out of reach. She and 
 I were talking, and her sister, a very matter-of-fact, 
 practical body, who attends to temporals for her, was 
 arranging a little lunch for us, when suddenly the bass 
 string of the guitar was struck loudly and distinctly. 
 
 &quot; Who struck that guitar ? &quot; said the sister. We 
 both looked up and saw that no body or thing was on 
 that side of the room. After the sister had gone out, 
 Mrs. E. said, &quot; Now, that is strange ! I asked last night 
 that if any spirit was present with us after you came 
 to-day, that it would try to touch that guitar.&quot; A little 
 while after her husband came in, and as we were talking 
 we were all stopped by a peculiar sound, as if somebody 
 had drawn a hand across all the strings at once. We 
 marveled, and I remembered the guitar at home. 
 
 What think you ? Have you had any more mani 
 festations, any truths from the spirit world ? 
 
 About the end of February the pleasant Florentine 
 circle broke up, and Mrs. Stowe and her party jour 
 neyed to Rome, where they remained until the middle 
 of April. We next find them in Naples, starting on a 
 six days trip to Castellamare, Sorrento, Salerno, Pses- 
 tum, and Amalfi ; then up Vesuvius, and to the Blue 
 Grotto of Capri, and afterwards back to Rome by dili 
 gence. Leaving Rome on May 9th, they traveled leis 
 urely towards Paris, which they reached on the 27th. 
 From there Mrs. Stowe wrote to her husband on May 
 28th: 
 

<page 392>
THE HOMEWARD VOYAGE. 353 
 
 Since my last letter a great change has taken place 
 in our plans, in consequence of which our passage for 
 America is engaged by the Europa, which sails the 16th 
 of June ; so, if all goes well, we are due in Boston four 
 weeks from this date. I long for home, for my hus 
 band and children, for my room, my yard and garden, 
 for the beautiful trees of Andover. We will make a 
 very happy home, and our children will help us. 
 
 Affectionately yours, HATTY. 
 
 This extended and pleasant tour was ended with an 
 equally pleasant homeward voyage, for on the Europa 
 were found Nathaniel Hawthorne and James T. Fields, 
 who proved most delightful traveling companions. 
 
 While Mrs. Stowe fully enjoyed her foreign experi 
 ences, she was so thoroughly American in every fibre 
 of her being that she was always thankful to return to 
 her own land and people. She could not, therefore, in 
 any degree reciprocate the views of Mr. Ruskin on this 
 subject, as expressed in the following letter, received 
 soon after her return to Andover : 
 
 GENEVA, June 18, 1860. 
 
 DEAR MRS. STOWE, It takes a great deal, when I 
 am at Geneva, to make me wish myself anywhere else, 
 and, of all places else, in London ; nevertheless, I very 
 heartily wish at this moment that I were looking out 
 on the Norwood Hills, and were expecting you and the 
 children to breakfast to-morrow. 
 
 I had very serious thoughts, when I received your 
 note, of running home ; but I expected that very day 
 an American friend, Mr. S., who I thought would miss 
 me more here than you would in London ; so I stayed. 
 

<page 393>
354 THE THIRD TRIP TO EUROPE. 
 
 What a dreadful thing it is that people should have 
 to go to America again, after coming to Europe ! It 
 seems to me an inversion of the order of nature. I 
 think America is a sort of &quot; United &quot; States of Proba 
 tion, out of which all wise people, being once delivered, 
 and having obtained entrance into this better world, 
 should never be expected to return (sentence irreme 
 diably ungrammatical), particularly when they have 
 been making themselves cruelly pleasant to friends here. 
 My friend Norton, whom I met first on this very blue 
 lake water, had no business to go back to Boston again, 
 any more than you. 
 
 I was waiting for S. at the railroad station on Thurs 
 day, and thinking of you, naturally enough, it seemed 
 so short a while since we were there together. I man 
 aged to get hold of Georgie as she was crossing the 
 rails, and packed her in opposite my mother and beside 
 me, and was thinking myself so clever, when you sent 
 that rascally courier for her ! I never forgave him 
 any of his behavior after his imperativeness on that 
 occasion. 
 
 And so she is getting nice and strong? Ask her, 
 please, when you write, with my love, whether, when 
 she stands now behind the great stick, one can see much 
 of her on each side ? 
 
 So you have been seeing the Pope and all his Easter 
 performances? I congratulate you, for I suppose it is 
 something like &quot; Positively the last appearance on any 
 stage.&quot; What was the use of thinking about him f You 
 should have had your own thoughts about what was to 
 come after him. I don t mean that Roman Catholicism 
 will die out so quickly. It will last pretty nearly as 
 

<page 394>
LETTER FROM MR. RUSKIN. 355 
 
 long as Protestantism, which keeps it up ; but I wonder 
 what is to come next. That is the main question just 
 now for everybody. 
 
 So you are coming round to Venice, after all ? We 
 shall all have to come to it, depend upon it, some way 
 or another. There never has been anything in any 
 other part of the world like Venetian strength well 
 developed. 
 
 I Ve no heart to write about anything in Europe to 
 you now. When are you coming back again ? Please 
 send me a line as soon as you get safe over, to say you 
 are all wrong, but not lost in the Atlantic. 
 
 I don t know if you will ever get this letter, but I 
 hope you will think it worth while to glance again at 
 the Denmark Hill pictures ; so I send this to my father, 
 who, I hope, will be able to give it you. 
 
 I really am very sorry you are going, you and 
 yours ; and that is absolute fact, and I shall not enjoy 
 my Swiss journey at all so much as I might. It was a 
 shame of you not to give me warning before. I could 
 have stopped at Paris so easily for you ! All good be 
 with you ! Kemember me devotedly to the young 
 ladies, and believe me ever affectionately yours, 
 
 J. KUSKIN. 
 
 In Rome Mrs. Stowe had formed a warm friendship 
 with the Brownings, with whom she afterwards main 
 tained a correspondence. The following letter from 
 Mrs. Browning was written a year after their first 
 meeting. 
 

<page 395>
356 THE THIRD TRIP TO EUROPE. 
 
 ROME, 126 VIA FELICE, 14 March, 1861. 
 
 MY DEAR MRS. STOWE, Let me say one word 
 first. Your letter, which would have given me pleas 
 ure if I had been in the midst of pleasures, came to me 
 when little beside could have pleased. Dear friend, 
 let me say it, I had had a great blow and loss in Eng 
 land, and you wrote things in that letter which seemed 
 meant for me, meant to do me good, and which did me 
 good, the first good any letter or any talk did me ; 
 and it struck me as strange, as more than a coinci 
 dence, that your first word since we parted in Rome 
 last spring should come to me in Rome, and bear so 
 directly on an experience which you did not know of. 
 I thank you very much. 
 
 The earnest stanzas I sent to England for one who 
 wanted them even more than I. I don t know how 
 people can keep up their prejudices against spiritualism 
 with tears in their eyes, how they are not, at least, 
 thrown on the &quot; wish that it might be true,&quot; and the 
 investigation of the phenomena, by that abrupt shut 
 ting in their faces of the door of death, which shuts 
 them out from the sight of their beloved. My ten 
 dency is to beat up against it like a crying child. Not 
 that this emotional impulse is the best for turning the 
 key and obtaining safe conclusions, no. I did not 
 write before because I always do shrink from touching 
 my own griefs, one feels at first so sore that nothing 
 but stillness is borne. It is only after, when one is 
 better, that one can express one s self at all. This is so 
 with me, at least, though perhaps it ought not to be so 
 with a poet. 
 
 If you saw my &quot; De Profundis &quot; you must under- 
 

<page 396>
LETTER FROM MRS. BROWNING. 357 
 
 stand that it was written nearly twenty years ago, and 
 referred to what went before. Mr. Howard s affliction 
 made me think of the MS. (in reference to a sermon of 
 Dr. Beecher s in the &quot; Independent &quot;), and I pulled it 
 out of a secret place and sent it to America, not think 
 ing that the publication would fall in so nearly with a 
 new grief of mine as to lead to misconceptions. In 
 fact the poem would have been an exaggeration in that 
 case, and unsuitable in other respects. 
 
 It refers to the greatest affliction of my life, the 
 only time when I felt despair, written a year after or 
 more. Forgive all these reticences. My husband calls 
 me &quot; peculiar &quot; in some things, peculiarly lache, per 
 haps. I can t articulate some names, or speak of cer 
 tain afflictions ; no, not to him, not after all these 
 years ! It s a sort of dumbness of the soul. Blessed 
 are those who can speak, I say. But don t you see 
 from this how I must want &quot; spiritualism &quot; above most 
 persons ? 
 
 Now let me be ashamed of this egotism, together 
 with the rest of the weakness obtruded on you here, 
 when I should rather have congratulated you, my dear 
 friend, on the great crisis you are passing through in 
 America. If the North is found noble enough to stand 
 fast on the moral question, whatever the loss or diminu 
 tion of territory, God and just men will see you greater 
 and more glorious as a nation. 
 
 I had much anxiety for you after the Seward and 
 Adams speeches, but the danger seems averted by that 
 fine madness of the South which seems judicial. The 
 tariff movement we should regret deeply (and do, some 
 of us), only I am told it was wanted in order to per- 
 

<page 397>
358 THE THIRD TRIP TO EUROPE. 
 
 suade those who were less accessible to moral argument. 
 It J s eking out the holy water with ditch water. If the 
 Devil flees before it, even so, let us be content. How 
 you must feel, you who have done so much to set this 
 accursed slavery in the glare of the world, convicting it 
 of hideousness ! They should raise a statue to you in 
 America and elsewhere. 
 
 Meanwhile I am reading you in the &quot; Independent,&quot; 
 sent to me by Mr. Tilton, with the greatest interest. 
 Your new novel opens beautifully. 1 
 
 Do write to me and tell me of yourself and the sub 
 jects which interest us both. It seems to me that our 
 Roman affairs may linger a little (while the Papacy 
 bleeds slowly to death in its finances) on account of 
 this violent clerical opposition in France. Otherwise 
 we were prepared for the fall of the house any morn 
 ing. Prince Napoleon s speech represents, with what 
 ever slight discrepancy, the inner mind of the emperor. 
 It occupied seventeen columns of the &quot; Moniteur &quot; and 
 was magnificent. Victor Emmanuel wrote to thank him 
 for it in the name of Italy, and even the English papers 
 praised it as &quot;a masterly exposition of the policy of 
 France.&quot; It is settled that we shall wait for Venice. 
 It will not be for long. Hungary is only waiting, and 
 even in the ashes of Poland there are flickering sparks. 
 Is it the beginning of the restitution of all things ? 
 
 Here in Rome there are fewer English than usual, 
 and more empty houses. There is a new story every 
 morning, and nobody to cut off the head of the Schehe 
 razade. Yesterday the Pope was going to Venice 
 directly, and, the day before, fixed the hour for Victor 
 
 1 The Pearl of Orr s Island. 
 

<page 398>
LETTER TO DR. HOLMES. 359 
 
 Emmanuel s coming, and the day before that brought 
 a letter from Cavour to Antonelli about sweeping the 
 streets clean for the feet of the king. The poor Ko- 
 mans live on these stories, while the Holy Father and 
 king of Naples meet holding one another s hands, and 
 cannot speak for sobs. The little queen, however, is a 
 heroine in her way and from her point of view, and 
 when she drives about in a common fiacre, looking very 
 pretty under her only crown left of golden hair, one 
 must feel sorry that she was not born and married 
 nearer to holy ground. My husband prays you to 
 remember him, and I ask your daughters to remember 
 both of us. Our boy rides his pony and studies under 
 his abbe, and keeps a pair of red cheeks, thank God. 
 
 I ought to send you more about the society in Rome, 
 but I have lived much alone this winter, and have little 
 to tell you. Dr. Manning and Mr. DeVere stay away, 
 not bearing, perhaps, to see the Pope in his agony. 
 Your ever affectionate friend, 
 
 ELIZABETH B. BROWNING. 
 
 Soon after her return to America Mrs. Stowe began 
 a correspondence with Dr. Oliver Wendell Holmes, 
 which opened the way for the warm friendship that has 
 stood the test of years. Of this correspondence the 
 two following letters, written about this time, are 
 
 worthy of attention. 
 
 ANDOVER, September 9, 1860. 
 
 DEAR DR. HOLMES, I have had an impulse upon 
 me for a long time to write you a line of recognition 
 and sympathy, in response to those that reached me 
 monthly in your late story in the &quot; Atlantic &quot; (&quot; Elsie 
 Vernier&quot;). 
 

<page 399>
360 THE THIRD TRIP TO EUROPE. 
 
 I know not what others may think of it, since I have 
 seen nobody since my return ; but to me it is of deeper 
 and broader interest than anything you have done yet, 
 and I feel an intense curiosity concerning that under 
 world of thought from which like bubbles your inci 
 dents and remarks often seem to burst up. The foun 
 dations of moral responsibility, the interlacing laws of 
 nature and spirit, and their relations to us here and 
 hereafter, are topics which I ponder more and more, 
 and on which only one medically educated can write 
 well. I think a course of medical study ought to be 
 required of all ministers. How I should like to talk 
 with you upon the strange list of topics suggested in 
 the schoolmaster s letter ! They are bound to agitate 
 the public mind more and more, and it is of the chiefest 
 importance to learn, if we can, to think soundly and 
 wisely of them. Nobody can be a sound theologian 
 who has not had his mind drawn to think with reveren 
 tial fear on these topics. 
 
 Allow me to hint that the monthly numbers are not 
 long enough. Get us along a little faster. You must 
 work this well out. Elaborate and give us all the par 
 ticulars. Old Sophie is a jewel ; give us more of her. 
 I have seen her. Could you ever come out and spend 
 a day with us ? The professor and I would so like to 
 have a talk on some of these matters with you ! 
 
 Very truly yours, H. B. STOWE. 
 
 ANDOVER, February 18, 1861. 
 
 DEAR DOCTOR, I was quite indignant to hear 
 yesterday of the very unjust and stupid attack upon 
 you in the . Mr. Stowe has written to them a 
 

<page 400>
&quot; WORDS DO NOT KILL.&quot; 361 
 
 remonstrance which I hope they will allow to appear 
 as he wrote it, and over his name. He was well ac 
 quainted with your father and feels the impropriety of 
 the thing. 
 
 But, my dear friend, in being shocked, surprised, or 
 displeased personally with such things, we must con 
 sider other people s natures. A man or woman may 
 wound us to the quick without knowing it, or meaning 
 to do so, simply through difference of fibre. As Cow- 
 per hath somewhere happily said : 
 
 &quot; Oh, why are farmers made so coarse, 
 
 Or clergy made so fine ? 
 A kick that scarce might move a horse 
 Might kill a sound divine.&quot; , 
 
 When once people get ticketed, and it is known that 
 one is a hammer, another a saw, and so on, if we happen 
 to get a taste of then* quality we cannot help being 
 hurt, to be sure, but we shall not take it ill of them. 
 There be pious, well-intending beetles, wedges, ham 
 mers, saws, and all other kinds of implements, good 
 except where they come in the way of our fingers 
 and from a beetle you can have only a beetle s gospel. 
 
 I have suffered in my day from this sort of handling, 
 which is worse for us women, who must never answer, 
 and once when I wrote to Lady Byron, feeling just as 
 you do about some very stupid and unkind things that 
 had invaded my personality, she answered me, &quot; Words 
 do not kill, my dear, or I should have been dead long 
 ago.&quot; 
 
 There is much true religion and kindness in the 
 world, after all, and as a general thing he who has 
 struck a nerve would be very sorry for it if he only 
 knew what he had done. 
 

<page 401>
362 THE THIRD TRIP TO EUROPE. 
 
 I would say nothing, if I were you. There is eternal 
 virtue in silence. 
 
 I must express my pleasure with the closing chapters 
 of &quot; Elsie.&quot; They are nobly and beautifully done, and 
 quite come up to what I wanted to complete my idea of 
 her character. I am quite satisfied with it now. It is 
 an artistic creation, original and beautiful. 
 Believe me to be your true friend, 
 
 H. B. STOWE.

 THANKSGIVING DAY IN WASHINGTON. THE PROCLAMATION OF 
 EMANCIPATION. REJOICINGS IN BOSTON. FRED STOWE AT 
 GETTYSBURG. LEAVING ANDOVER AND SETTLING IN HARTFORD. 
 A REPLY TO THE WOMEN OF ENGLAND. LETTERS FROM JOHN 
 BRIGHT, ARCHBISHOP WHATELY, AND NATHANIEL HAWTHORNE. 
 
 IMMEDIATELY after Mrs. Stowe s return from Europe, 
 it became only too evident that the nation was rapidly 
 and inevitably drifting into all the horrors of civil war. 
 To use her own words : &quot; It was God s will that this 
 nation the North as well as the South should 
 deeply and terribly suffer for the sin of consenting to 
 and encouraging the great oppressions of the South ; 
 that the ill-gotten wealth, which had arisen from strik 
 ing hands with oppression and robbery, should be paid 
 back in the taxes of war ; that the blood of the poor 
 slave, that had cried so many years from the ground in 
 vain, should be answered by the blood of the sons from 
 the best hearthstones through all the free States ; that 
 the slave mothers, whose tears nobody regarded, should 
 have with them a great company of weepers, North and 
 South, Rachels weeping for their children and refus 
 ing to be comforted ; that the free States, who refused 
 to listen when they were told of lingering starvation, 
 cold, privation, and barbarous cruelty, as perpetrated on 
 

<page 403>
364 THE CIVIL WAR. 
 
 the slave, should have lingering starvation, cold, hunger, 
 and cruelty doing its work among their own sons, at 
 the hands of these slave-masters, with whose sins our 
 nation had connived.&quot; 
 
 Mrs. Stowe spoke from personal experience, having 
 seen her own son go forth in the ranks of those who 
 first responded to the President s call for volunteers. 
 He was one of the first to place his name on the mus 
 ter-roll of Company A of the First Massachusetts Vol 
 unteers. While his regiment was still at the camp in 
 Cambridge, Mrs. Stowe was called to Brooklyn on im 
 portant business, from which place she writes to her 
 husband under the date June 11, 1861 : 
 
 &quot; Yesterday noon Henry (Ward Beecher) came in, 
 saying that the Commonwealth, with the First (Massa 
 chusetts) Kegiment on board, had just sailed by. Im 
 mediately I was of course eager to get to Jersey City to 
 see Fred. Sister Eunice said she would go with me, 
 and in a few minutes she, Hatty, Sam Scoville, and I 
 were in a carriage, driving towards the Fulton Ferry. 
 Upon reaching Jersey City we found that the boys 
 were dining in the depot, an immense building with 
 many tracks and platforms. It has a great cast-iron 
 gallery just under the roof, apparently placed there 
 with prophetic instinct of these times. There was a 
 crowd of people pressing against the grated doors, 
 which were locked, but through which we could see the 
 soldiers. It was with great difficulty that we were at 
 last permitted to go inside, and that object seemed to 
 be greatly aided by a bit of printed satin that some 
 man gave Mr. Scoville. 
 
 &quot; When we were in, a vast area of gray caps and 
 

<page 404>
TO THE FRONT! 365 
 
 blue overcoats was presented. The boys were eating, 
 drinking, smoking, talking, singing, and laughing. 
 Company A was reported to be here, there, and every 
 where. At last S. spied Fred in the distance, and went 
 leaping across the tracks towards him. Immediately 
 afterwards a blue-overcoated figure bristling with knap 
 sack and haversack, and looking like an assortment of 
 packages, came rushing towards us. 
 
 &quot; Fred was overjoyed, you may be sure, and my first 
 impulse was to wipe his face with my handkerchief be 
 fore I kissed him. He was in high spirits, in spite of 
 the weight of blue overcoat, knapsack, etc., etc., that 
 he would formerly have declared intolerable for half an 
 hour. I gave him my handkerchief and Eunice gave 
 him hers, with a sheer motherly instinct that is so 
 strong within her, and then we filled his haversack with 
 oranges. 
 
 &quot; We stayed with Fred about two hours, during 
 which time the gallery was filled with people, cheering 
 and waving their handkerchiefs. Every now and then 
 the band played inspiriting airs, in which the soldiers 
 joined with hearty voices. While some of the companies 
 sang, others were drilled, and all seemed to be having a 
 general jollification. The meal that had been provided 
 was plentiful, and consisted of coffee, lemonade, sand 
 wiches, etc. 
 
 &quot; On our way out we were introduced to the Rev. 
 Mr. Cudworth, chaplain of the regiment. He is a fine- 
 looking man, with black eyes and hair, set off by a 
 white havelock. He wore a sword, and Fred, touching 
 it, asked, Is this for use or ornament, sir ? 
 
 &quot; Let me see you in danger/ answered the chaplain, 
 6 and you 11 find out/ 
 

<page 405>
366 THE CIVIL WAR. 
 
 &quot; I said to him I supposed he had had many an one 
 confided to his kind offices, but I could not forbear add 
 ing one more to the number. He answered, You may 
 rest assured, Mrs. Stowe, I will do all in my power. 
 
 &quot; We parted from Fred at the door. He said he felt 
 lonesome enough Saturday evening on the Common in 
 Boston, where everybody was taking leave of somebody, 
 and he seemed to be the only one without a friend, but 
 that this interview made up for it all. 
 
 &quot; I also saw young Henry. Like Fred he is mysteri 
 ously changed, and wears an expression of gravity and 
 care. So our boys come to manhood in a day. Now I 
 am watching anxiously for the evening paper to tell me 
 that the regiment has reached Washington in safety.&quot; 
 
 In November, 1862, Mrs. Stowe was invited to visit 
 Washington, to be present at a great thanksgiving din 
 ner provided for the thousands of fugitive slaves who 
 had flocked to the city. She accepted the invitation 
 the more gladly because her son s regiment was en 
 camped near the city, and she should once more see 
 him. He was now Lieutenant Stowe, having honestly 
 won his promotion by bravery on more than one hard- 
 fought field. She writes of this visit : 
 
 Imagine a quiet little parlor with a bright coal fire, 
 and the gaslight burning above a centre-table, about 
 which Hatty, Fred, and I are seated. Fred is as happy 
 as happy can be to be with mother and sister once 
 more. All day yesterday we spent in getting him. 
 First we had to procure a permit to go to camp, then 
 we went to the fort where the colonel is, and then to 
 another where the brigadier-general is stationed. I was 
 

<page 406>
AT WASHINGTON. 367 
 
 so afraid they would not let him come with us, and was 
 never happier than when at last he sprang into the car 
 riage free to go with us for forty-eight hours. &quot; Oh ! &quot; 
 he exclaimed in a sort of rapture, &quot; this pays for a year 
 and a half of fighting and hard work ! &quot; 
 
 We tried hard to get the five o clock train out to 
 Laurel, where J. s regiment is stationed, as we wanted 
 to spend Sunday all together ; but could not catch it, 
 and so had to content ourselves with what we could 
 have. I have managed to secure a room for Fred next 
 ours, and feel as though I had my boy at home once 
 more. He is looking very well, has grown in thick 
 ness, and is as loving and affectionate as a boy can be. 
 
 I have just been writing a pathetic appeal to the 
 brigadier-general to let him stay with us a week. I 
 have also written to General Buckingham in regard to 
 changing him from the infantry, in which there seems 
 to be no prospect of anything but garrison duty, to the 
 cavalry, which is full of constant activity. 
 
 General B. called on us last evening. He seemed to 
 think the prospect before us was, at best, of a long war. 
 He was the officer deputed to carry the order to Gen 
 eral McClellan relieving him of command of the army. 
 He carried it to him in his tent about twelve o clock at 
 night. Burnside was there. McClellan said it was 
 very unexpected, but immediately turned over the com 
 mand. I said I thought he ought to have expected it 
 after having so disregarded the President s order. Gen 
 eral B. smiled and said he supposed McClellan had 
 done that so often before that he had no idea any 
 notice would be taken of it this time. 
 
 Now, as I am very tired, I must close, and remain as 
 always, lovingly yours, HATTY. 
 

<page 407>
368 THIS CIVIL WAR. 
 
 During the darkest and most bitter period of the 
 Civil War, Mrs. Stowe penned the following letter to 
 the Duchess of Argyll : 
 
 ANDOVER, July 31, 1863. 
 
 MY DEAR FRIEND, Your lovely, generous letter 
 was a real comfort to me, and reminded me that a year 
 and, alas ! a whole year had passed since I wrote 
 to your dear mother, of whom I think so often as one 
 of God s noblest creatures, and one whom it comforts 
 me to think is still in our world. 
 
 So many, good and noble, have passed away whose 
 friendship was such a pride, such a comfort to me ! 
 Your noble father, Lady Byron, Mrs. Browning, 
 their spirits are as perfect as ever passed to the world of 
 light. I grieve about your dear mother s eyes. I have 
 thought about you all, many a sad, long, quiet hour, as 
 I have lain on my bed and looked at the pictures on 
 my wall ; one, in particular, of the moment before the 
 Crucifixion, which is the first thing I look at when I 
 wake in the morning. I think how suffering is, and 
 must be, the portion of noble spirits, and no lot so 
 brilliant that must not first or last dip into the shadow 
 of that eclipse. Prince Albert, too, the ideal knight, 
 the Prince Arthur of our times, the good, wise, steady 
 head and heart we that is, our world, we Anglo-Sax 
 ons need so much. And the Queen ! yes, I have 
 thought of and prayed for her, too. But could a 
 woman hope to have always such a heart, and yet ever 
 be weaned from earth &quot; all this and heaven, too &quot; ? 
 
 Under my picture I have inscribed, &quot; Forasmuch as 
 Christ also hath suffered for us in the flesh, arm your 
 selves with the same mind.&quot;

LETTER TO THE DUCHESS OF ARGYLL. 369 
 
 This year has been one long sigh, one smothering 
 sob, to me. And I thank God that we have as yet one 
 or two generous friends in England who understand 
 and feel for our cause. 
 
 The utter failure of Christian, anti-slavery England, 
 in those instincts of a right heart which always can see 
 where the cause of liberty lies, has been as bitter a 
 grief to me as was the similar prostration of all our 
 American religious people in the day of the Fugitive 
 Slave Law. Exeter Hall is a humbug, a pious hum 
 bug, like the rest. Lord Shaftesbury. Well, let him 
 go ; he is a Tory, and has, after all, the instincts of his 
 class. But I saw your duke s speech to his tenants ! 
 That was grand ! If he can see these things, they are 
 to be seen, and why cannot Exeter Hall see them ? It 
 is simply the want of the honest heart. 
 
 Why do the horrible barbarities of Southern soldiers 
 cause no comment? Why is the sympathy of the Brit 
 ish Parliament reserved for the poor women of New 
 Orleans, deprived of their elegant amusement of throw 
 ing vitriol into soldiers faces, and practicing indecen 
 cies inconceivable in any other state of society? Why 
 is all expression of sympathy on the Southern side ? 
 There is a class of women in New Orleans whom Butler 
 protects from horrible barbarities, that up to his day 
 have been practiced on them by these so-called New Or 
 leans ladies, but British sympathy has ceased to notice 
 them. You see I am bitter. I am. You wonder at 
 my brother. He is a man, and feels a thousand times 
 more than I can, and deeper than all he ever has ex 
 pressed, the spirit of these things. You must not won 
 der, therefore. Remember it is the moment when every 
 

<page 409>
370 THE CIVIL WAR. 
 
 nerve is vital ; it is our agony ;. we tread the winepress 
 alone, and they whose cheap rhetoric has been for years 
 pushing us into it now desert en masse. I thank my 
 God I always loved and trusted most those who now do 
 stand true, your family, your duke, yourself, your 
 noble mother. I have lost Lady Byron. Her great 
 heart, her eloquent letters, would have been such a joy 
 to me ! And Mrs. Browning, oh such a heroic woman ! 
 None of her poems can express what she was, so 
 grand, so comprehending, so strong, with such inspired 
 insight! She stood by Italy through its crisis. Her 
 heart was with all good through the world. Your 
 prophecy that we shall come out better, truer, stronger, 
 will, I am confident, be true, and it was worthy of your 
 self and your good lineage. 
 
 Slavery will be sent out by this agony. We are only 
 in the throes and ravings of the exorcism. The roots 
 of the cancer have gone everywhere, but they must die 
 will. Already the Confiscation Bill is its natural 
 destruction. Lincoln has been too slow. He should 
 have done it sooner, and with an impulse, but come it 
 must, come it will. Your mother will live to see slav 
 ery abolished, unless England forms an alliance to hold 
 it up. England is the great reliance of the slave-power 
 to-day ,^ind next to England the faltering weakness of 
 the North, which palters and dare not fire the great 
 broadside for fear of hitting friends. These things 
 must be done, and sudden, sharp remedies are mercy. 
 Just now we are in a dark hour ; but whether God be 
 with us or not, I know He is with the slave, and with 
 his redemption will come the solution of our question. 
 I have long known what and who we had to deal with 
 

<page 410>
A DAHOMIAN SOCIETY. 371 
 
 in this, for when I wrote &quot; Uncle Tom s Cabin &quot; I had 
 letters addressed to me showing a state of society per 
 fectly inconceivable. That they violate graves, make 
 drinking-cups of skulls, that ladies wear cameos cut 
 from bones, and treasure scalps, is no surprise to me. 
 If I had written what I knew of the obscenity, brutal 
 ity, and cruelty of that society down there, society 
 would have cast out the books ; and it is for their inter 
 est, the interest of the whole race in the South, that we 
 should succeed. I wish them no ill, feel no bitterness ; 
 they have had a Dahomian education which makes them 
 savage. We don t expect any more of them, but if 
 slavery is destroyed, one generation of education and 
 liberty will efface these stains. They will come to N 
 themselves, these States, and be glad it is over. 
 
 I am using up my paper to little purpose. Please 
 give my best love to your dear mother. I am going to 
 write to her. If I only could have written the things 
 I have often thought ! I am going to put on her brace 
 let, with the other dates, that of the abolition of slavery 
 in the District of Columbia. Remember me to the 
 duke and to your dear children. My husband desires 
 his best regards, my daughters also. 
 
 I am lovingly ever yours, 
 
 H. B. STOWE. 
 
 Later in the year we hear again from her son in the 
 army, and this time the news comes in a chaplain s 
 letter from the terrible field of Gettysburg. He 
 writes : 
 

<page 411>
372 THE CIVIL WAR. 
 
 GETTYSBURG, PA., Saturday, July 11, 9.30 p. M. 
 
 MRS. H. B. STOWE : 
 
 Dear Madam, Among the thousands of wounded 
 and dying men on this war-scarred field, I have just 
 met with your son, Captain Stowe. If you have not 
 already heard from him, it may cheer your heart to 
 know that he is in the hands of good, kind friends. 
 He was struck by a fragment of a shell, which entered 
 his right ear. He is quiet and cheerful, longs to see 
 some member of his family, and is, above all, anxious 
 that they should hear from him as soon as possible. I 
 assured him I would write at once, and though I am 
 wearied by a week s labor here among scenes of terrible 
 suffering, I know that, to a mother s anxious heart, even 
 a hasty scrawl about her boy will be more than wel 
 come. 
 
 May God bless and sustain you in this troubled time ! 
 Yours with sincere sympathy, 
 
 J. M. CROWELL. 
 
 / 
 
 The wound in the head was not fatal, and after weary 
 months of intense suffering it imperfectly healed ; but 
 the cruel iron had too nearly touched the brain of the 
 young officer, and never again was he what he had 
 been. Soon after the war his mother bought a planta 
 tion in Florida, largely in the hope that the out-of-door 
 life connected with its management might be beneficial 
 to her afflicted son. He remained on it for several 
 years, and then, being possessed with the idea that a 
 long sea voyage would do him more good than any 
 thing else, sailed from New York to San Francisco 
 around the Horn. That he reached the latter city in 
 

<page 412>
THE NEW HOME. 373 
 
 safety is known ; but that is all. No word from him 
 or concerning him has ever reached the loving hearts 
 that have waited so anxiously for it, and of his ultimate 
 fate nothing is known. 
 
 Meantime, the year 1863 was proving eventful in 
 many other ways to Mrs. Stowe. In the first place, the 
 long and pleasant Andover connection of Professor 
 Stowe was about to be severed, and the family were to 
 remove to Hartford, Conn. They were to occupy a 
 house that Mrs. Stowe was building on the bank of 
 Park River. It was erected in a grove of oaks that 
 had in her girlhood been one of Mrs. Stowe s favorite 
 resorts. Here, with her friend Georgiana May, she had 
 passed many happy hours, and had often declared that 
 if she were ever able to build a house, it should stand 
 in that very place. Here, then, it was built in 1863, 
 and as the location was at that time beyond the city 
 limits, it formed, with its extensive, beautiful groves, a 
 particularly charming place of residence. Beautiful as 
 it was, however, it was occupied by the family for only 
 a few years. The needs of the growing city caused fac 
 tories to spring up in the neighborhood, and to escape 
 their encroachments the Stowes in 1873 bought and 
 moved into the house on Forest Street that has ever 
 since been their Northern home. Thus the only house 
 Mrs. Stowe ever planned and built for herself has been 
 appropriated to the use of factory hands, and is now a 
 tenement occupied by several families. 
 
 Another important event of 1863 was the publishing 
 of that charming story of Italy, &quot; Agnes of Sorrento,&quot; 
 which had been begun nearly four years before. This 
 story suggested itself to Mrs. Stowe while she was 
 

<page 413>
374 THE CIVIL WAR. 
 
 abroad during the winter of 1859-60. The origin of 
 the story is as follows : One evening, at a hotel in 
 Florence, it was proposed that the various members of 
 the party should write short stories and read them for 
 the amusement of the company. Mrs. Stowe took part 
 in this literary contest, and the result was the first rough 
 sketch of &quot; Agnes of Sorrento.&quot; From this beginning 
 was afterwards elaborated &quot; Agnes of Sorrento,&quot; with 
 a dedication to Annie Howard, who was one of the 
 party. 
 
 Not the least important event of the year to Mrs. 
 Stowe, and the world at large through her instrumen 
 tality, was the publication in the &quot; Atlantic Monthly &quot; 
 of her reply to the address of the women of England. 
 The &quot; reply &quot; is substantially as follows :

 SISTERS, More than eight years ago you sent to 
 us in America a document with the above heading. It 
 is as follows : 
 
 &quot; A common origin, a common faith, and, we sin 
 cerely believe, a common cause, urge us, at the present 
 moment, to address you on the subject of that system 
 of negro slavery which still prevails so extensively, and, 
 even under kindly disposed masters, with such frightful 
 results, in many of the vast regions of the Western 
 world. 
 
 &quot; We will not dwell on the ordinary topics, on the 
 progress of civilization, on the advance of freedom 
 everywhere, on the rights and requirements of the nine 
 teenth century ; but we appeal to you very seriously to 
 reflect, and to ask counsel of God, how far such a state 
 of things is in accordance with his Holy Word, the 
 inalienable rights of immortal souls, and the pure and 
 merciful spirit of the Christian religion. We do not 
 shut our eyes to the difficulties, nay, the dangers, that 
 might beset the immediate abolition of that long-estab 
 lished system. We see and admit the necessity of 
 preparation for so great an event ; but, in speaking of 
 indispensable preliminaries, we cannot be silent on those 
 laws of your country which, in direct contravention of 
 God s own law, instituted in the time of man s inno- 
 

<page 417>
376 THE CIVIL WAR. 
 
 cency/ deny in effect to the slave the sanctity of mar 
 riage, with all its joys, rights, and obligations ; which 
 separate, at the will of the master, the wife from the 
 husband, and the children from the parents. Nor can 
 we be silent on that awful system which, either by 
 statute or by custom, interdicts to any race of men, 
 or any portion of the human family, education in the 
 truths of the gospel and the ordinances of Christianity. 
 A remedy applied to these two evils alone would 
 commence the amelioration of their sad condition. We 
 appeal to you then, as sisters, as wives, and as mothers, 
 to raise your voices to your fellow-citizens, and your 
 prayers to God, for the removal of this affliction and 
 disgrace from the Christian world. 
 
 &quot; We do not say these things in a spirit of self-com 
 placency, as though our nation were free from the guilt 
 it perceives in others. 
 
 &quot; We acknowledge with grief and shame our heavy 
 share in this great sin. We acknowledge that our fore 
 fathers introduced, nay compelled the adoption, of slav 
 ery in those mighty colonies. We humbly confess it 
 before Almighty God ; and it is because we so deeply 
 feel and unfeignedly avow our own complicity, that we 
 now venture to implore your aid to wipe away our com 
 mon crime and our common dishonor.&quot; 
 
 This address, splendidly illuminated on vellum, was 
 sent to our shores at the head of twenty-six folio vol 
 umes, containing considerably more than half a million 
 of signatures of British women. It was forwarded to 
 me with a letter from a British nobleman, now occupy 
 ing one of the highest official positions in England, with 
 

<page 418>
THE ADDRESS. 377 
 
 a request on behalf of these ladies that it should be in 
 any possible way presented to the attention of my coun 
 trywomen. 
 
 This memorial, as it now stands in its solid oaken 
 case, with its heavy folios, each bearing on its back the 
 imprint of the American eagle, forms a most unique 
 library, a singular monument of an international ex 
 pression of a moral idea. No right-thinking person can 
 find aught to be objected against the substance or form 
 of this memorial. It is temperate, just, and kindly ; 
 and on the high ground of Christian equality, where it 
 places itself, may be regarded as a perfectly proper ex 
 pression of sentiment, as between blood relations and 
 equals in two different nations- The signatures to this 
 appeal are not the least remarkable part of it ; for, be 
 ginning at the very steps of the throne, they go down 
 to the names of women in the very humblest conditions 
 in life, and represent all that Great Britain possesses, 
 not only of highest and wisest, but of plain, homely 
 common sense and good feeling. Names of wives of 
 cabinet ministers appear on the same page with the 
 names of wives of humble laborers, names of duch 
 esses and countesses, of wives of generals, ambassadors, 
 savants, and men of letters, mingled with names traced 
 in trembling characters by hands evidently unused to 
 hold the pen, and stiffened by lowly toil. Nay, so deep 
 and expansive was the feeling, that British subjects in 
 foreign lands had their representation. Among the 
 signatures are those of foreign residents, from Paris to 
 Jerusalem. Autographs so diverse, and collected from 
 sources so various, have seldom been found in juxta 
 position. They remain at this day a silent witness of 
 

<page 419>
378 THE CIVIL WAR. 
 
 a most singular tide of feeling which at that time swept 
 over the British community and made for itself an ex 
 pression, even at the risk of offending the sensibilities 
 of an equal and powerful nation. 
 
 No reply to that address, in any such tangible and 
 monumental form, has ever been possible. It was im 
 possible to canvass our vast territories with the zealous 
 and indefatigable industry with which England was 
 canvassed for signatures. In America, those possessed 
 of the spirit which led to this efficient action had no 
 leisure for it. All their time and energies were already 
 absorbed in direct efforts to remove the great evil, con 
 cerning which the minds of their English sisters had 
 been newly aroused, and their only answer was the 
 silent continuance of these efforts. 
 
 From the slaveholding States, however, as was to be 
 expected, came a flood of indignant recrimination and 
 rebuke. No one act, perhaps, ever produced more 
 frantic irritation, or called out more unsparing abuse. 
 It came with the whole united weight of the British 
 aristocracy and commonalty on the most diseased and 
 sensitive part of our national life ; and it stimulated 
 that fierce excitement which was working before, and 
 has worked since, till it has broken out into open war. 
 
 The time has come, however, when such an astonish 
 ing page has been turned, in the anti-slavery history of 
 America, that the women of our country, feeling that 
 the great anti-slavery work to which their English sis 
 ters exhorted them is almost done, may properly and 
 naturally feel moved to reply to their appeal, and lay 
 before them the history of what has occurred since the 
 receipt of their affectionate and Christian address. 
 

<page 420>
SLAVERY UNDER THE BAN. 379 
 
 Your address reached us just as a great moral con 
 flict was coming to its intensest point. The agitation 
 kept up by the anti-slavery portion of America, by 
 England, and by the general sentiment of humanity in 
 Europe, had made the situation of the slaveholding 
 aristocracy intolerable. As one of them at the time 
 expressed it, they felt themselves under the ban of the 
 civilized world. Two courses only were open to them : 
 to abandon slave institutions, the sources of their wealth 
 and political power, or to assert them with such an over 
 whelming national force as to compel the respect and 
 assent of mankind. They chose the latter. 
 
 To this end they determined to seize on and control 
 all the resources of the Federal Government, and to 
 spread their institutions through new States and Terri 
 tories until the balance of power should fall into their 
 hands and they should be able to force slavery into all 
 the free States. 
 
 A leading Southern senator boasted that he would 
 yet call the roll of his slaves on Bunker Hill ; and for 
 a while the political successes of the slave-power were 
 such as to suggest to New England that this was no 
 impossible event. 
 
 They repealed the Missouri Compromise, which had 
 hitherto stood like the Chinese wall, between our North 
 western Territories and the irruptions of slaveholding 
 barbarians. 
 
 Then came the struggle between freedom and slavery 
 in the new territory ; the battle for Kansas and Ne 
 braska, fought with fire and sword and blood, where a 
 race of men, of whom John Brown was the immortal 
 type, acted over again the courage, the perseverance, 
 

<page 421>
380 THE CIVIL WAR. 
 
 and the military-religious ardor of the old Covenanters 
 of Scotland, and like them redeemed the ark of lib 
 erty at the price of their own blood, and blood dearer 
 than their own. 
 
 The time of the Presidential canvass which elected 
 Mr. Lincoln was the crisis of this great battle. The 
 conflict had become narrowed down to the one point of 
 the extension of slave territory. If the slaveholders 
 could get States enough, they could control and rule ; 
 if they were outnumbered by free States, their institu 
 tions, by the very law of their nature, would die of 
 suffocation. Therefore Fugitive Slave Law, District 
 of Columbia, Inter-State Slave-trade, and what not, 
 were all thrown out of sight for a grand rally on this 
 vital point. A President was elected pledged to oppo 
 sition to this one thing alone, a man known to be in 
 favor of the Fugitive Slave Law and other so-called 
 compromises of the Constitution, but honest and faith 
 ful in his determination on this one subject. That this 
 was indeed the vital point was shown by the result. 
 The moment Lincoln s election was ascertained, the 
 slaveholders resolved to destroy the Union they could 
 no longer control. 
 
 They met and organized a Confederacy which they 
 openly declared to be the first republic founded on the 
 right and determination of the white man to enslave 
 the black man, and, spreading their banners, declared 
 themselves to the Christian world of the nineteenth 
 century as a nation organized with the full purpose and 
 intent of perpetuating slavery. 
 
 But in the course of the struggle that followed, it 
 became important for the new confederation to secure 
 

<page 422>
CAUSE OF THE WAR. 381 
 
 the assistance of foreign powers, and infinite pains were 
 then taken to blind and bewilder the mind of England 
 as to the real issues of the conflict in America. 
 
 It has been often and earnestly asserted that slavery 
 had nothing to do with this conflict ; that it was a mere 
 struggle for power ; that the only object was to restore 
 the Union as it was, with all its abuses. It is to be 
 admitted that expressions have proceeded from the 
 national administration which naturally gave rise to 
 misapprehension, and therefore we beg to speak to you 
 on this subject more fully. 
 
 And first the declaration of the Confederate States 
 themselves is proof enough, that, whatever may be de 
 clared on the other side, the maintenance of slavery is 
 regarded by them as the vital object of their movement. 
 
 We ask your attention under this head to the decla 
 ration of their Vice-President, Stephens, in that remark 
 able speech delivered on the 21st of March, 1861, at 
 Savannah, Georgia, wherein he declares the object and 
 purposes of the new Confederacy. It is one of the 
 most extraordinary papers which our century has pro 
 duced. I quote from the verbatim report in the &quot; Sa 
 vannah Kepublican &quot; of the address as it was deliv 
 ered in the Athenaeum of that city, on which occasion, 
 says the newspaper from which I copy, &quot; Mr. Stephens 
 took his seat amid a burst of enthusiasm and applause 
 such as the Athenseum has never had displayed within 
 its walls within the recollection of the oldest inhab 
 itant. &quot; 
 
 Last, not least, the new Constitution has put at rest 
 forever all the agitating questions relating to our pe 
 culiar institution, African slavery as it exists among 
 

<page 423>
382 THE CIVIL WAR. 
 
 us, the proper status of the negro in our form of civil 
 ization. This was the immediate cause of the late 
 rupture and present revolution. Jefferson, in his 
 forecast, had anticipated this as the &quot; rock upon which 
 the old Union would split.&quot; He was right. What was 
 a conjecture with him is now a realized fact. But 
 whether he fully comprehended the great truth upon 
 which that rock stood and stands may be doubted. 
 
 The prevailing ideas entertained by him and most 
 of the leading statesmen at the time of the formation 
 of the old Constitution were, that the enslavement of 
 the African was in violation of the laws of nature ; 
 that it was wrong in principle, socially, morally, 
 and politically. 
 
 In the mean while, during the past year, the Repub 
 lican administration, with all the unwonted care of 
 organizing an army and navy, and conducting military 
 operations on an immense scale, have proceeded to 
 demonstrate the feasibility of overthrowing slavery by 
 purely constitutional measures. To this end they have 
 instituted a series of movements which have made this 
 year more fruitful in anti-slavery triumphs than any 
 other since the emancipation of the British West Indies. 
 The District of Columbia, as belonging strictly to the 
 national government and to no separate State, has 
 furnished a fruitful subject of remonstrance from 
 British Christians with America. We have abolished 
 slavery there, and thus wiped out the only blot of terri 
 torial responsibility on our escutcheon. 
 
 By another act, equally grand in principle, and far 
 more important in its results, slavery is forever excluded 
 from the Territories of the United States. 
 

<page 424>
THE PROGRESS OF FREEDOM. 383 
 
 By another act, America has consummated the long- 
 delayed treaty with Great Britain for the suppression 
 of the slave-trade. In ports whence slave vessels for 
 merly sailed with the connivance of the port officers, 
 the administration has placed men who stand up to 
 their duty, and for the first time in our history the 
 slave-trader is convicted and hung as a pirate. This 
 abominable secret traffic has been wholly demolished 
 by the energy of the Federal Government. 
 
 Lastly, and more significant still, the United States 
 government has in its highest official capacity taken 
 distinct anti-slavery ground, and presented to the coun 
 try a plan of peaceable emancipation with suitable coniv 
 pensation. This noble-spirited and generous offer has 
 been urged on the slaveholding States by the chief 
 executive with earnestness and sincerity. But this is 
 but half the story of the anti-slavery triumphs of this 
 year. We have shown you what has been done for 
 freedom by the simple use of the ordinary constitu 
 tional forces of the Union. We are now to show you 
 what has been done to the same end by the constitu 
 tional war-power of the nation. 
 
 By this power it has been this year decreed that 
 every slave of a rebel who reaches the lines of our army 
 becomes a free man ; that all slaves found deserted by 
 their masters become free men ; that every slave em 
 ployed in any service for the United States thereby 
 obtains his liberty ; and that every slave employed 
 against the United States in any capacity obtains his 
 liberty ; and lest the army should contain officers dis 
 posed to remand slaves to their masters, the power of 
 judging and delivering up slaves is denied to army 
 officers, and all such acts are made penal. 
 

<page 425>
384 THE CIVIL WAR. 
 
 By this act the Fugitive Slave Law is for all present 
 purposes practically repealed. With this understand 
 ing and provision, wherever our armies march they 
 carry liberty with them. For be it remembered that 
 our army is almost entirely a volunteer one, and that 
 the most zealous and ardent volunteers are those who 
 have been for years fighting, with tongue and pen, the 
 abolition battle. So marked is the character of our 
 soldiers in this respect, that they are now familiarly 
 designated in the official military dispatches of the 
 Confederate States as &quot; the Abolitionists.&quot; Conceive 
 the results when an army so empowered by national 
 law marches through a slave territory. One regiment 
 alone has to our certain knowledge liberated two thou 
 sand slaves during the past year, and this regiment is 
 but one out of hundreds. 
 
 Lastly, the great decisive measure of the war has 
 appeared, the President s Proclamation of Eman 
 cipation. 
 
 This also has been much misunderstood and misrep 
 resented in England. It has been said to mean vir 
 tually this : Be loyal and you shall keep your slaves ; 
 rebel and they shall be free. But let us remember 
 what we have just seen of the purpose and meaning of 
 the Union to which the rebellious States are invited 
 back. It is to a Union which has abolished slavery in 
 the District of Columbia, and interdicted slavery in the 
 Territories ; which vigorously represses the slave-trade, 
 and hangs the convicted slaver as a pirate ; which 
 necessitates emancipation by denying expansion to 
 slavery, and facilitates it by the offer of compensation. 
 A.ny slaveholding States which should return to such a 
 

<page 426>
THE PRESIDENT S PROCLAMATION. 385 
 
 Union might fairly be supposed to return with the 
 purpose of peaceable emancipation. The President s 
 Proclamation simply means this : Come in and emanci 
 pate peaceably with compensation ; stay out and I 
 emancipate, nor will I protect you from the conse 
 quences. 
 
 Will our sisters in England feel no heartbeat at that 
 event? Is it not one of the predicted voices of the 
 latter day, saying under the whole heavens, &quot; It is 
 done ; the kingdoms of this world are become the king 
 doms of our Lord and of His Christ &quot; ? 
 ^And now, sisters of England, in this solemn, ex 
 pectant hour, let us speak to you of one thing which 
 fills our hearts with pain and solicitude. It is an un 
 accountable fact, and one which we entreat you seri 
 ously to ponder, that the party which has brought the 
 cause of freedom thus far on its way, during the past 
 eventful year, has found little or no support in Eng 
 land. Sadder than this, the party which makes slavery 
 the chief corner-stone of its edifice finds in England 
 its strongest defenders. 
 
 o 
 
 The voices that have spoken for us who contend for 
 liberty have been few and scattering. God forbid that 
 we should forget those few noble voices, so sadly ex 
 ceptional in the general outcry against us ! They are, 
 alas ! too few to be easily forgotten. False statements 
 have blinded the minds of your community j and turned 
 the most generous sentiments of the British heart 
 against us. The North are fighting for supremacy and 
 the South for independence, has been the voice. In 
 dependence ? for what ? to do what ? To prove the 
 doctrine that all men are not equal ; to establish the 
 doctrine that the white may enslave the negro !

386 THE CIVIL WAR. 
 
 In the beginning of our struggle, the voices that 
 reached us across the water said : &quot;If we were only 
 sure you were fighting for the abolition of slavery, we 
 should not dare to say whither our sympathies for your 
 cause might not carry us.&quot; Such, as we heard, were 
 the words of the honored and religious nobleman who 
 draughted this very letter which you signed and sent 
 us, and to which we are now replying. 
 
 When these words reached us we said: &quot;We can 
 wait; our friends in England will soon see whither this 
 conflict is tending.&quot; A year and a half have passed ; 
 step after step has been taken for liberty ; chain after 
 chain has fallen, till the march of our armies is choked 
 and clogged by the glad flocking of emancipated slaves ; 
 the day of final emancipation is set ; the border States 
 begin to move in voluntary consent ; universal freedom 
 for all dawns like the sun in the distant horizon, and 
 still no voice from England. No voice ? Yes, we have 
 heard on the high seas the voice of a war-steamer, built 
 for a man-stealing Confederacy, with English gold, in 
 an English dockyard, going out of an English har 
 bor, manned by English sailors, with the full knowl 
 edge of English government officers, in defiance of the 
 Queen s proclamation of neutrality ! So far has English 
 sympathy overflowed. We have heard of other steam 
 ers, iron-clad, designed to furnish to a slavery-defend 
 ing Confederacy their only lack, a navy for the high 
 seas. We have heard that the British Evangelical 
 
 o 
 
 Alliance refuses to express sympathy with the liberating 
 party, when requested to do so by the French Evangel 
 ical Alliance. We find in English religious newspapers 
 all those sad degrees in the downward-sliding scale of 
 

<page 428>
A TOUCHING SCENE. 387 
 
 defending and apologizing for slaveholders and slave- 
 holding, with which we have so many years contended 
 in our own country. We find the President s Proclama 
 tion of Emancipation spoken of in those papers only as 
 an incitement to servile insurrection. Nay, more, we 
 find in your papers, from thoughtful men, the admis 
 sion of the rapid decline of anti-slavery sentiments in 
 England. 
 
 This very day the writer of this has been present at 
 a solemn religious festival in the national capital, given 
 at the home of a portion of those fugitive slaves who 
 have fled to our lines for protection, who, under the 
 shadow of our flag, find sympathy and succor. The 
 national day of thanksgiving was there kept by over a 
 thousand redeemed slaves, and for whom Christian 
 charity had spread an ample repast. Our sisters, we 
 wish you could have witnessed the scene. We wish 
 you could have heard the prayer of a blind old negro, 
 called among his fellows John the Baptist, when in 
 touching broken English he poured forth his thanks 
 givings. We wish you could have heard the sound of 
 that strange rhythmical chant which is now forbidden 
 to be sung on Southern plantations, the psalm of this 
 modern exodus, which combines the barbaric fire of 
 the Marseillaise with the religious fervor of the old 
 Hebrew prophet : 
 
 &quot; Oh, go down, Moses, 
 Way down into Egypt s land ! 
 Tell King Pharaoh 
 To let my people go ! 
 Stand away dere, 
 Stand away dere, 
 And let my people go ! &quot; 
 

<page 429>
388 THE CIVIL WAR. 
 
 As we were leaving, an aged woman came and lifted up 
 her hands in blessing. &quot;Bressed be de Lord dat 
 brought me to see dis first happy day of my life ! 
 Bressed be de Lord ! &quot; In all England is there no 
 Amen? 
 
 We have been shocked and saddened by the question 
 asked in an association of Congregational ministers in 
 England, the very blood relations of the liberty-loving 
 Puritans, &quot; Why does not the North let the South 
 go?&quot; 
 
 What ! give up the point of emancipation for these 
 four million slaves? Turn our backs on them, and 
 leave them to their fate ? What ! leave our white 
 brothers to run a career of oppression and robbery, 
 that, as sure as there is a God that ruleth in the armies 
 of heaven, will bring down a day of wrath and doom ? 
 Kemember that wishing success to this slavery-estab 
 lishing effort is only wishing to the sons and daughters 
 of the South all the curses that God has written against 
 oppression. Mark our words ! If we succeed, the 
 children of these very men who are now fighting us will 
 rise up to call us blessed. Just as surely as there is a 
 God who governs in the world, so surely all the laws of 
 national prosperity follow in the train of equity ; and if 
 we succeed, we shall have delivered the children s chil 
 dren of our misguided brethren from the wages of sin, 
 which is always and everywhere death. 
 
 And now, sisters of England, think it not strange if 
 we bring back the words of your letter, not in bitter 
 ness, but in deepest sadness, and lay them down at 
 your door. We say to you, Sisters, you have spoken 
 well ; we have heard you ; we have heeded ; we have

LETTER FROM JOHN BRIGHT. 389 
 
 striven in the cause, even unto death. We have sealed 
 our devotion by desolate hearth and darkened home 
 stead, by the blood of sons, husbands, and brothers. 
 In many of our dwellings the very light of our lives 
 has gone out ; and yet we accept the life-long darkness 
 as our own part in this great and awful expiation, by 
 which the bonds of wickedness shall be loosed, and 
 abiding peace established on the foundation of right 
 eousness. Sisters, what have you done, and what do 
 you mean to do ? 
 
 We appeal to you as sisters, as wives, and as mothers, 
 to raise your voices to your fellow-citizens, and your 
 prayers to God for the removal of this affliction and 
 disgrace from the Christian world. 
 
 In behalf of many thousands of American women. 
 
 HARRIET BEECHEB STOWE. 
 
 WASHINGTON, November 27, 1862. 
 
 The publication of this reply elicited the following 
 interesting letter from John Bright : 
 
 ROCHDALE, March 9, 1863. 
 
 DEAR MRS. STOWE, I received your kind note 
 with real pleasure, and felt it very good of you to send 
 me a copy of the &quot; Atlantic Monthly &quot; with your noble 
 letter to the women of England. I read every word of 
 it with an intense interest, and I am quite sure that its 
 effect upon opinion here has been marked and bene 
 ficial. It has covered some with shame, and it has 
 compelled many to think, and it has stimulated not a 
 few to act. Before this reaches you, you will have 
 seen what large and earnest meetings have been held in 
 all our towns in favor of abolition and the North. No 
 

<page 431>
390 THE CIVIL WAR. 
 
 town has a building large enough to contain those who 
 come to listen, to applaud, and to vote in favor of free 
 dom and the Union. The effect of this is evident on 
 our newspapers and on the tone of Parliament, where 
 now nobody says a word in favor of recognition, or 
 mediation, or any such thing. 
 
 The need and duty of England is admitted to be a 
 strict neutrality, but the feeling of the millions of her 
 people is one of friendliness to the United States and 
 its government. It would cause universal rejoicing, 
 among all but a limited circle of aristocracy and com 
 mercially rich and corrupt, to hear that the Northern 
 forces had taken Vicksburg on the great river, and 
 Charleston on the Atlantic, and that the neck of the 
 conspiracy was utterly broken. 
 
 I hope your people may have strength and virtue to 
 win the great cause intrusted to them, but it is fearful 
 to contemplate the amount of the depravity in the 
 North engendered by the long power of slavery. New 
 England is far ahead of the States as a whole, too 
 instructed and too moral ; but still I will hope that 
 she will bear the nation through this appalling danger. 
 
 I well remember the evening at Rome and our con 
 versation. You lamented the election of Buchanan. 
 You judged him with a more unfriendly but a more 
 correct eye than mine. He turned out more incapable 
 and less honest than I hoped for. And I think I was 
 right in saying that your party was not then sufficiently 
 consolidated to enable it to maintain its policy in the 
 execution, even had Fremont been elected. As it is 
 now, six years later, the North but falteringly supports 
 the policy of the government, though impelled by the 
 

<page 432>
ARCHBISHOP WHATELTS VIEWS. 391 
 
 force of events which then you did not dream of. 
 President Lincoln has lived half his troubled reign. In 
 the coming half I hope he may see land ; surely slavery 
 will be so broken up that nothing can restore and 
 renew it; and, slavery once fairly gone, I know not 
 how all your States can long be kept asunder. 
 Believe me very sincerely yours, 
 
 JOHN BRIGHT. 
 
 It also called forth from Archbishop Whately the 
 following letter : 
 
 PALACE, DUBLIN, January, 1863. 
 
 DEAR MADAM, In acknowledging your letter and 
 pamphlet, I take the opportunity of laying before you 
 what I collect to be the prevailing sentiments here on 
 American affairs. Of course there is a great variety 
 of opinion, as may be expected in a country like ours. 
 Some few sympathize with the Northerns, and some few 
 with the Southerns, but far the greater portion sympa 
 thize with neither completely, but lament that each 
 party should be making so much greater an expenditure 
 of life and property than can be compensated for by 
 any advantage they can dream of obtaining. 
 
 Those who are the least favorable to the Northerns 
 are not so from any approbation of slavery, but from 
 not understanding that the war is waged in the cause 
 of abolition. &quot; It was waged,&quot; they say, &quot; ostensibly 
 for the restoration of the Union,&quot; and in attestation of 
 this, they refer to the proclamation which announced 
 the confiscation of slaves that were the property of 
 secessionists, while those who adhered to the Federal 
 cause should be exempt from such confiscation, which, 
 

<page 433>
392 THE CIVIL WAR. 
 
 they say, did not savor much of zeal for abolition. 
 And if the other object the restoration of the Union 
 could be accomplished, which they all regard as 
 hopeless, they do not understand how it will tend to 
 the abolition of slavery. On the contrary, &quot;if,&quot; say 
 they, &quot; the separation had been allowed to take place 
 peaceably, the Northerns might, as we do, have pro 
 claimed freedom to every slave who set foot on their ter 
 ritory ; which would have been a great check to slavery, 
 and especially to any cruel treatment of slaves.&quot; Many 
 who have a great dislike to slavery yet hold that the 
 Southerns had at least as much right to secede as the 
 Americans had originally to revolt from Great Britain. 
 And there are many who think that, considering the 
 dreadful distress we have suffered from the cotton fam 
 ine, we have shown great forbearance in withstanding 
 the temptation of recognizing the Southern States and 
 to break the blockade. 
 
 Then, again, there are some who are provoked at the 
 incessant railing at England, and threats of an invasion 
 of Canada, which are poured forth in some of the 
 American papers. 
 
 There are many, also, who consider that the present 
 state of things cannot continue much longer if the Con 
 federates continue to hold their own, as they have done 
 hitherto ; and that a people who shall have maintained 
 their independence for two or three years will be rec 
 ognized by the principal European powers. Such 
 appears to have been the procedure of the European 
 powers in all similar cases, such as the revolt of the 
 Anglo-American and Spanish- American colonies, of the 
 Haytians and the Belgians. In these and other like 
 cases, the rule practically adopted seems to have been 
 

<page 434>
GRADUAL EMANCIPATION. 393 
 
 to recognize the revolters, not at once, but after a rea 
 sonable time had been allowed to see whether they 
 could maintain their independence ; and this without 
 being understood to have pronounced any decision 
 either way as to the justice of the cause. 
 
 Moreover, there are many who say that the negroes 
 and people of color are far from being kindly or justly 
 treated in the Northern States. An emancipated slave, 
 at any rate, has not received good training for earning 
 his bread by the wages of labor ; and if, in addition to 
 this and his being treated as an outcast, he is excluded, 
 as it is said, from many employments, by the refusal of 
 white laborers to work along with him, he will have 
 gained little by taking refuge in the Northern States. 
 
 I have now laid before you the views which I con 
 ceive to be most prevalent among us, and for which I 
 am not myself responsible. 
 
 For the safe and effectual emancipation of slaves, I 
 myself consider there is no plan so good as the gradual 
 one which was long ago suggested by Bishop Hinds. 
 What he recommended was an ad valorem tax upon 
 slaves, the value to be fixed by the owner, with an 
 option to government to purchase at that price. Thus 
 the slaves would be a burden to the master, and those 
 the most so who should be the most valuable, as being 
 the most intelligent and steady, and therefore the best 
 qualified for freedom ; and it would be his interest to 
 train his slaves to be free laborers, and to emancipate 
 them, one by one, as speedily as he could with safety. 
 I fear, however, that the time is gone by for trying this 
 experiment in America. 
 
 With best wishes for the new year, believe me 
 
 Yours faithfully, ED. WHATELY.

 Among the many letters written from this side of the 
 Atlantic regarding the reply, was one from Nathaniel 
 Hawthorne, in which he says : 
 
 I read with great pleasure your article in the last 
 &quot; Atlantic.&quot; If anything could make John Bull blush, 
 I should think it might be that ; but he is a hardened 
 and villainous hypocrite. I always felt that he cared 
 nothing for or against slavery, except as it gave him a 
 vantage-ground on which to parade his own virtue and 
 sneer at our iniquity. 
 
 With best regards from Mrs. Hawthorne and myself 
 to yourself and family, sincerely yours,

 IN 1866, the terrible conflict between the North and 
 South having ended, Mrs. Stowe wrote the following 
 letter to the Duchess of Argyll : 
 
 HARTFORD, February 19, 1866. 
 
 MY DEAR FRIEND, Your letter was a real spring 
 of comfort to me, bringing refreshingly the pleasant 
 library at Inverary and the lovely days I spent there. 
 
 I am grieved at what you say of your dear mother s 
 health. I showed your letter to Mrs. Perkins, and we 
 both agreed in saying that we should like for a time to 
 fill the place of maid to her, as doubtless you all feel, 
 too. I should so love to be with her, to read to her, 
 and talk to her ! and oh, there is -so much that would 
 cheer and comfort a noble heart like hers that we could 
 talk about. Oh, my friend, when I think of what has 
 been done these last few years, and of what is now 
 doing, I am lost in amazement. I have just, by way 
 of realizing it to myself, been reading &quot; Uncle Tom s 
 

<page 437>
396 FLORIDA. 
 
 Cabin &quot; again, and when I read that book, scarred and 
 seared and burned into with the memories of an an 
 guish and horror that can never be forgotten, and think 
 it is all over now, all past, and that now the questions 
 debated are simply of more or less time before granting 
 legal suffrage to those who so lately were held only as 
 articles of merchandise, when this comes over me I 
 think no private or individual sorrow can ever make me 
 wholly without comfort. If my faith in God s presence 
 and real, living power in the affairs of men ever grows 
 dim, this makes it impossible to doubt. 
 
 I have just had a sweet and lovely Christian letter 
 from Garrison, whose beautiful composure and thank 
 fulness in his hour of victory are as remarkable as his 
 wonderful courage in the day of moral battle. His 
 note ends with the words, &quot; And who but God is to be 
 glorified?&quot; Garrison s attitude is far more exalted 
 than that of Wendell Phillips. He acknowledges the 
 great deed done. He suspends his &quot; Liberator &quot; with 
 words of devout thanksgiving, and devotes himself 
 unobtrusively to the work yet to be accomplished for 
 the freedmen ; while Phillips seems resolved to ignore 
 the mighty work that has been done, because of the 
 inevitable shortcomings and imperfections that beset it 
 still. We have a Congress of splendid men, men of 
 stalwart principle and determination. We have a Pres- 
 / ident l honestly seeking to do right ; and if he fails in 
 
 knowing just what rightris, it is because he is a man 
 born and reared in a slave State, and acted on by many 
 influences which we cannot rightly estimate unless we 
 were in his place. My brother Henry has talked with 
 
 1 Andrew Johnson. 
 

<page 438>
VIEWS ON RECONSTRUCTION. 397 
 
 him earnestly and confidentially, and has faith in him 
 as an earnest, good man seeking to do right. Henry 
 takes the ground that it is unwise and impolitic to 
 endeavor to force negro suffrage on the South at the 
 point of the bayonet. His policy would be, to hold 
 over the negro the protection of our Freedman s Bureau 
 until the great laws of free labor shall begin to draw 
 the master and servant together ; to endeavor to soothe 
 and conciliate, and win to act with us, a party com 
 posed of the really good men at the South. 
 
 For this reason he has always advocated lenity of 
 measures towards them. He wants to get them into a 
 state in which the moral influence of the North can act 
 upon them beneficially, and to get such a state of 
 things that there will be a party at the South to pro 
 tect the negro. 
 
 Charles Sumner is looking simply at the abstract 
 right of the thing. Henry looks at actual probabilities. 
 We all know that the state of society at the South is 
 such that laws are a very inadequate protection even to 
 white men. Southern elections always have been scenes 
 of mob violence when only white men voted. 
 
 Multitudes of lives have been lost at the polls in this 
 way, and if against their will negro suffrage was forced 
 upon them, I do not see how any one in their senses can 
 expect anything less than an immediate war of races. 
 
 If negro suffrage were required as a condition of 
 acquiring political position, there is no doubt the slave 
 States would grant it ; grant it nominally, because they 
 would know that the grant never could or would be 
 come an actual realization. And what would then be 
 gained for the negro ? 
 

<page 439>
398 FLORIDA. 
 
 &amp;lt; I am sorry that people cannot differ on such great 
 and perplexing public questions without impugning 
 each other s motives. Henry has been called a back 
 slider because of the lenity of his counsels, but I can 
 not but think it is the Spirit of Christ that influences 
 him. Garrison has been in the same way spoken of as 
 a deserter, because he says that a work that is done 
 shall be called done, and because he would not keep up 
 an anti-slavery society when slavery is abolished ; and I 
 think our President is much injured by the abuse that 
 is heaped on him, and the selfish and unworthy motives 
 that are ascribed to him by those who seem determined 
 to allow to nobody an honest, unselfish difference in 
 judgment from their own.^/ 
 
 Henry has often spoken of you and your duke as 
 pleasant memories in a scene of almost superhuman 
 labor and excitement. He often said to me : &quot; When 
 this is all over, when we have won the victory, then 
 I will write to the duchess.&quot; But when it was over 
 and the flag raised again at Sumter his arm was smit 
 ten down with the news of our President s death ! We 
 all appreciate your noble and true sympathy through 
 the dark hour of our national trial. You and yours 
 are almost the only friends we now have left in Eng 
 land. You cannot know what it was, unless you could 
 imagine your own country to be in danger of death, 
 extinction of nationality. That, dear friend, is an ex 
 perience which shows us what we are and what we can 
 feel. I am glad to hear that we may hope to see your 
 son in this country. I fear so many pleasant calls will 
 beset his path that we cannot hope for a moment, but 
 it would give us all the greatest pleasure to see him 
 

<page 440>

 liere. Our dull, prosy, commonplace, though good old 
 Hartford could offer few attractions compared with 
 Boston or New York, and yet I hope he will not leave 
 us out altogether if he comes among us. God bless 
 him ! You are very happy indeed in being permitted 
 to keep all your dear ones and see them growing up. 
 
 I want to ask a favor. Do you have, as we do, 
 cartes de visite f If you have, and could send me one 
 of yourself and the duke and of Lady Edith and your 
 eldest son, I should be so very glad to see how you are 
 looking now ; and the dear mother, too, I should so like 
 to see how she looks. It seems almost like a dream to 
 look back to those pleasant days. I am glad to see 
 you still keep some memories of our goings on. Geor- 
 gie s marriage is a very happy one to us. They live in 
 Stockbridge, the loveliest part of Massachusetts, and 
 her husband is a most devoted pastor, and gives all his 
 time and property to the great work which he has em 
 braced, purely for the love of it. My other daughters 
 are with me, and my son, Captain Stowe, who has come 
 with weakened health through our struggle, suffering 
 constantly from the effects of a wound in his head 
 received at Gettysburg, which makes his returning to 
 his studies a hard struggle. My husband is in better 
 health since he resigned his professorship, and desires 
 his most sincere regards to yourself and the duke, and 
 his profound veneration to your mother. Sister Mary 
 also desires to be remembered to you, as do also my 
 daughters. Please tell me a little in your next of Lady 
 Edith ; she must be very lovely now. 
 
 I am, with sincerest affection, ever yours, 
 
 H. B. STOWE. 
 

<page 441>
400 FLORIDA. 
 
 Soon after the close of the war Mrs. Stowe conceived 
 the idea of making for herself and her family a winter 
 home in the South, where she might escape the rigors 
 of Northern winters, and where her afflicted son Fred 
 erick might enjoy an out-of-door life throughout the 
 year. She was also most anxious to do her share to 
 wards educating and leading to a higher life those col 
 ored people whom she had helped so largely to set free, 
 and who were still in the state of profound ignorance 
 imposed by slavery. In writing of her hopes and plans 
 to her brother Charles Beecher, in 1866, she says : 
 
 &quot; My plan of going to Florida, as it lies in my mind, 
 is not in any sense a mere worldly enterprise. I have 
 for many years had a longing to be more immediately 
 doing Christ s work on earth. My heart is with that 
 poor people whose cause in words I have tried to plead, 
 and who now, ignorant and docile, are just in that for 
 mative stage in which whoever seizes has them. 
 
 &quot; Corrupt politicians are already beginning to specu 
 late on them as possible capital for their schemes, and 
 to fill their poor heads with all sorts of vagaries. Flor 
 ida is the State into which they have, more than any 
 where else, been pouring. Emigration is positively 
 and decidedly setting that way ; but as yet it is mere 
 worldly emigration, with the hope of making money, 
 nothing more. 
 
 The Episcopal Church is, however, undertaking, 
 under direction of the future Bishop of Florida, a wide- 
 embracing scheme of Christian activity for the whole 
 State. In this work I desire to be associated, and my 
 plan is to locate at some salient point on the St. John s 
 River, where I can form the nucleus of a Christian 
 

<page 442>
LAUREL GROVE. 401 
 
 neighborhood, whose influence shall be felt far beyond 
 its own limits. 
 
 During this year Mrs. Stowe partially carried her 
 plan into execution by hiring an old plantation called 
 &quot;Laurel Grove,&quot; on the west side of the St. John s 
 River, near the present village of Orange Park. Here 
 she established her son Frederick as a cotton planter, 
 and here he remained for two years. This location did 
 not, however, prove entirely satisfactory, nor did the 
 raising of cotton prove to be, under the circumstances, 
 a profitable business. After visiting Florida during 
 the winter of 186667, at which time her attention was 
 drawn to the beauties and superior advantages of 
 Mandarin on the east side of the river, Mrs. Stowe 
 writes from Hartford, May 29, 1867, to Rev. Charles 
 Beecher : 
 
 MY DEAR BROTHER, We are now thinking seri 
 ously of a place in Mandarin much more beautiful than 
 any other in the vicinity. It has on it five large date 
 palms, an olive tree in full bearing, besides a fine 
 orange grove which this year will yield about seventy- 
 five thousand oranges. If we get that, then I want 
 you to consider the expediency of buying the one next 
 to it. It contains about two hundred acres of land, on 
 which is a fine orange grove, the fruit from which last 
 year brought in two thousand dollars as sold at the 
 wharf. It is right on the river, and four steamboats 
 pass it each week, on their way to Savannah and 
 Charleston. There is on the place a very comfortable 
 cottage, as houses go out there, where they do not need 
 to be built as substantially as with us. 
 

<page 443>
402 FLORIDA. 
 
 I am now in correspondence with the Bishop of 
 Florida, with a view to establishing a line of churches 
 along the St. John s River, and if I settle at Mandarin, 
 it will be one of my stations. Will you consent to enter 
 the Episcopal Church and be our clergyman ? You are 
 just the man we want. If my tasks and feelings did 
 not incline me toward the Church, I should still choose 
 it as the best system for training immature minds such 
 as those of our negroes. The system was composed 
 with reference to the wants of the laboring class of 
 England, at a time when they were as ignorant as our 
 negroes now are. 
 
 I long to be at this work, and cannot think of it 
 without my heart burning within me. Still I leave all 
 with my God, and only hope He will open the way for 
 me to do all that I want to for this poor people. 
 
 Affectionately yours, H. B. STOWE. 
 
 Mrs. Stowe had some years before this joined the 
 Episcopal Church, for the sake of attending the same 
 communion as her daughters, who were Episcopalians. 
 Her brother Charles did not, however, see fit to change 
 his creed, and though he went to Florida he settled a 
 hundred and sixty miles west from the St. John s River, 
 at Newport, near St. Marks, on the Gulf coast, and 
 about twenty miles from Tallahassee. Here he lived 
 every winter and several summers for fifteen years, and 
 here he left the impress of his own remarkably sweet 
 and lovely character upon the scattered population of 
 the entire region. 
 
 Mrs. Stowe in the mean time purchased the property, 
 with its orange grove and comfortable cottage, that she 
 

<page 444>

<page 445>

<page 446>
MANDARIN. 403 
 
 had recommended to him, and thus Mandarin became 
 her winter home. No one who has ever seen it can 
 forget the peaceful beauty of this Florida home and its 
 surroundings. The house, a story and a half cottage 
 of many gables, stands on a bluff overlooking the 
 broad St. John s, which is five miles wide at this point. 
 It nestles in the shade of a grove of superb, moss- 
 hung live-oaks, around one of which the front piazza 
 is built. Several fine old orange trees also stand near 
 the cottage, scenting the air with the sweet perfume of 
 their blossoms in the early spring, and offering their 
 golden fruit to whoever may choose to pluck it during 
 the winter months. Back of the house stretches the 
 weU-tended orange grove in which Mrs. Stowe took 
 such genuine pride and pleasure. Everywhere about 
 the dwelling and within it were flowers and singing 
 birds, while the rose garden in front, at the foot of the 
 bluff, was the admiration of all who saw it. 
 
 Here, on the front piazza, beneath the grand oaks, 
 looking out on the calm sunlit river, Professor Stowe 
 enjoyed that absolute peace and restful quiet for which 
 his scholarly nature had always longed, but which had 
 been forbidden to the greater part of his active life. 
 At almost any hour of the day the well-known figure, 
 with snow-white, patriarchal beard and kindly face, 
 might be seen sitting there, with a basket of books, 
 many of them in dead and nearly forgotten languages, 
 close at hand. An amusing incident of family life was 
 as follows : Some Northern visitors seemed to think 
 that the family had no rights which were worthy of a 
 a moment s consideration. They would land at the 
 wharf, roam about the place, pick flowers, peer into the 
 

<page 447>
404 FLORIDA. 
 
 house through the windows and doors, and act with 
 that disregard of all the proprieties of life which char 
 acterizes ill-bred people when on a journey. The pro 
 fessor had been driven well-nigh distracted by these 
 migratory bipeds. One day, when one of them broke 
 a branch from an orange tree directly before his eyes, 
 and was bearing it off in triumph with all its load of 
 golden fruit, he leaped from his chair, and addressed 
 the astonished individual on those fundamental princi 
 ples of common honesty, which he deemed outraged by 
 this act. The address was vigorous and truthful, but 
 of a kind which will not bear repeating. &quot; Why,&quot; 
 said the horror-stricken culprit, &quot; I thought that this 
 was Mrs. Stowe s place ! &quot; &quot; You thought it was Mrs. 
 Stowe s place ! &quot; Then, in a voice of thunder, &quot; I 
 would have you understand, sir, that I am the propri 
 etor and protector of Mrs. Stowe and of this place, and 
 if you commit any more such shameful depredations I 
 will have you punished as you deserve ! &quot; Thus this 
 predatory Yankee was taught to realize that there is a 
 God in Israel. 
 
 In April, 1869, Mrs. Stowe was obliged to hurry 
 North in order to visit Canada in time to protect her 
 English rights in &quot; Oldtown Folks,&quot; which she had just 
 finished. 
 
 About this time she secured a plot of land, and made 
 arrangements for the erection on it of a building that 
 should be used as a schoolhouse through the week, and 
 as a church on Sunday. For several years Professor 
 Stowe preached during the winter in this little school- 
 house, and Mrs. Stowe conducted Sunday-school, sew 
 ing classes, singing classes, and various other gather- 
 

<page 448>
PALMETTO LEAVES. 405 
 
 ings for instruction and amusement, all of which were 
 well attended and highly appreciated by both the white 
 and colored residents of the neighborhood. 
 
 Upon one occasion, having just arrived at her Man 
 darin home, Mrs. Stowe writes : 
 
 &quot; At last, after waiting a day and a half in Charles 
 ton, we arrived here about ten o clock Saturday morn 
 ing, just a week from the day we sailed. The house 
 looked so pretty, and quiet, and restful, the day was so 
 calm and lovely, it seemed as though I had passed away 
 from all trouble, and was looking back upon you all 
 from a secure resting-place. Mr. Stowe is very happy 
 here, and is constantly saying how pleasant it is, and 
 how glad he is that he is here. He is so much im 
 proved in health that already he is able to take a con 
 siderable walk every day. 
 
 &quot; We are all well, contented, and happy, and we 
 have six birds, two dogs, and a pony. Do write more 
 and oftener. Tell me all the little nothings and no- 
 wheres. You can t imagine how they are magnified by 
 the time they have reached into this remote corner.&quot; 
 
 In 1872 she wrote a series of Florida sketches, which 
 were published in book form, the following year, by 
 J. R. Osgood & Co., under the title of &quot; Palmetto 
 Leaves.&quot; May 19, 1873, she writes to her brother 
 Charles at Newport, Fla. : 
 
 &quot; Although you have not answered my last letter, I 
 cannot leave Florida without saying good-by. I send 
 you the Palmetto Leaves and my parting love. If 
 I could either have brought or left my husband, I 
 should have come to see you this winter. The account 
 of your roses fills me with envy. 
 

<page 449>
406 FLORIDA. 
 
 &quot; We leave on the San Jacinto next Saturday, and I 
 am making the most of the few charming hours yet 
 left ; for never did we have so delicious a spring. I 
 never knew such altogether perfect weather. It is 
 enough to make a saint out of the toughest old Cal- 
 vinist that ever set his face as a flint. How do you 
 think New England theology would have fared if our 
 fathers had been landed here instead of on Plymouth 
 Rock? 
 
 &quot; The next you hear of me will be at the North, 
 where our address is Forest Street, Hartford. We have 
 bought a pretty cottage there, near to Belle, and shall 
 spend the summer there.&quot; 
 
 In a letter written in May of the following year to 
 her son Charles, at Harvard, Mrs. Stowe says : &quot; I can 
 hardly realize that this long, flowery summer, with its 
 procession of blooms and fruit, has been running on at 
 the same time with the snowbanks and sleet storms of 
 the North. But so it is. It is now the first of May. 
 Strawberries and blackberries are over with us ; oranges 
 are in a waning condition, few and far between. Now 
 we are going North to begin another summer, and have 
 roses, strawberries, blackberries, and green peas come 
 again. 
 
 &quot;I am glad to hear of your reading. The effect 
 produced on you by Jonathan Edwards is very similar 
 to that produced on me when I took the same mental 
 bath. His was a mind whose grasp and intensity you 
 cannot help feeling. He was a poet in the intensity of 
 his conceptions, and some of his sermons are more 
 terrible than Dante s Inferno. 
 
 In November, 1874, upon their return to Mandarin, 
 

<page 450>
AN EASTER SUNDAY. 407 
 
 she writes : &quot; We have had heavenly weather, and we 
 needed it ; for our house was a cave of spider-webs, 
 cockroaches, dirt, and all abominations, but less than a 
 week has brought it into beautiful order. It now be 
 gins to put on that quaint, lively, pretty air that so 
 fascinates me. Our weather is, as I said, heavenly, 
 neither hot nor cold ; cool, calm, bright, serene, and so 
 tranquillizing. There is something indescribable about 
 the best weather we have down here. It does not de 
 bilitate me like the soft October air in Hartford.&quot; 
 
 During the following February, she writes in reply 
 to an invitation to visit a Northern watering place later 
 in the season : &quot; I shall be most happy to come, and 
 know of nothing to prevent. I have, thank goodness, 
 no serial story on hand for this summer, to hang like 
 an Old Man of the Sea about my neck, and hope to 
 enjoy a little season of being like other folks. It is a 
 most lovely day to-day, most unf alien Eden-like.&quot; 
 
 In a letter written later in the same season, March 
 28, 1875, Mrs. Stowe gives us a pleasant glimpse at 
 their preparations for the proper observance of Easter 
 Sunday in the little Mandarin schoolhouse. She says : 
 &quot; It was the week before Easter, and we had on our 
 minds the dressing of the church. There my two 
 Gothic fireboards were to be turned into a pulpit for 
 the occasion. I went to Jacksonville and got a five- 
 inch moulding for a base, and then had one fireboard 
 sawed in two, so that there was an arched panel for 
 each end. Then came a rummage for something for 
 a top, and to make a desk of, until it suddenly occurred 
 to me that our old black walnut extension table had a 
 set of leaves. They were exactly the thing. The whole 
 

<page 451>
408 FLORIDA. 
 
 was trimmed with a beading of yellow pine, and rubbed, 
 and pumice-stoned, and oiled, and I got out my tubes 
 of paint and painted the nail-holes with Vandyke brown. 
 By Saturday morning it was a lovely little Gothic pul 
 pit, and Anthony carried it over to the schoolhouse and 
 took away the old desk which I gave him for his meet 
 ing-house. That afternoon we drove out into the woods 
 and gathered a quantity of superb Easter lilies, pa- 
 paw, sparkleberry, great fern -leaves, and cedar. In 
 the evening the girls went over to the Meads to prac 
 tice Easter hymns; but I sat at home and made a 
 cross, eighteen inches long, of cedar and white lilies. 
 This Southern cedar is the most exquisite thing ; it is 
 so feathery and delicate. 
 
 &quot; Sunday morning was cool and bright, a most per 
 fect Easter. Our little church was full, and everybody 
 seemed delighted with the decorations. Mr. Stowe 
 preached a sermon to show that Christ is going to put 
 everything right at last, which is comforting. So the 
 day was one of real pleasure, and also I trust of real 
 benefit, to the poor souls who learned from it that 
 Christ is indeed risen for them.&quot; 
 
 During this winter the following characteristic letters 
 passed between Mrs. Stowe and her valued friend, Dr. 
 Oliver Wendell Holmes, called forth by the sending to 
 the latter of a volume of Mrs. Stowe s latest stories : 
 
 BOSTON, January 8, 1876. 
 
 MY DEAR MRS. STOWE, I would not write to 
 thank you for your most welcome &quot; Christmas Box,&quot; 
 
 &quot; A box whose sweets compacted lie,&quot; 
 
 before I had read it, and every word of it. I have 
 

<page 452>
A LETTER FROM DR. HOLMES. 409 
 
 been very much taken up with antics of one kind and 
 another, and have only finished it this afternoon. The 
 last of the papers was of less comparative value to me 
 than to a great fraction of your immense parish of 
 readers, because I am so familiar with every movement 
 of the Pilgrims in their own chronicles. 
 
 &quot; Deacon Pitkin s Farm &quot; is full of those thoroughly 
 truthful touches of New England in which, if you are 
 not unrivaled, I do not know who your rival may be. 
 I wiped the tears from one eye in reading &quot; Deacon 
 Pitkin s Farm.&quot; 
 
 I wiped the tears, and plenty of them, from both 
 eyes, in reading &quot; Betty s Bright Idea.&quot; It is a most 
 charming and touching story, and nobody can read who 
 has not a heart like a pebble, without being melted into 
 tenderness. 
 
 How much you have done and are doing to make 
 our New England life wholesome and happy ! If there 
 is any one who can look back over a literary lif e which 
 has pictured our old and helped our new civilization, 
 it is yourself. Of course your later books have harder 
 work cut out for them than those of any other writer. 
 They have had &quot; Uncle Tom s Cabin &quot; for a rival. The 
 brightest torch casts a shadow in the blaze of a light, 
 and any transcendent success affords the easiest handle 
 for that class of critics whose method is the one that 
 Dogberry held to be &quot; odious.&quot; 
 
 I think it grows pleasanter to us to be remembered 
 by the friends we still have, as with each year they 
 grow fewer. We have lost Agassiz and Sumner from 
 our circle, and I found Motley stricken with threatening 
 illness (which I hope is gradually yielding to treatment), 
 

<page 453>
410 FLORIDA. 
 
 in the profoundest grief at the loss of his wife, another 
 old and dear friend of mine. So you may be assured 
 that I feel most sensibly your kind attention, and send 
 you my heartfelt thanks for remembering me. 
 
 Always, dear Mrs. Stowe, faithfully yours, 
 
 0. W. HOLMES. 
 
 To this letter Mrs. Stowe replied as follows : 
 
 MANDARIN, February 23, 1876. 
 
 DEAR DOCTOR, How kind it was of you to write 
 me that very beautiful note ! and how I wish you were 
 just where I am, to see the trees laden at the same time 
 with golden oranges and white blossoms ! I should so 
 like to cut off a golden cluster, leaves and all, for you. 
 Well, Boston seems very far away and dreamy, like 
 some previous state of existence, as I sit on the veranda 
 and gaze on the receding shores of the St. John s, which 
 at this point is five miles wide. 
 
 &quot; Dear doctor, how time slips by ! I remember when 
 Sumner seemed to me a young man, and now he has 
 gone. And Wilson has gone, and Chase, whom I knew 
 as a young man in society in Cincinnati, has gone, and 
 Stanton has gone, and Seward has gone, and yet how 
 lively the world races on ! A few air-bubbles of praise 
 or lamentation, and away sails the great ship of life, no 
 matter over whose grave ! 
 
 Well, one cannot but feel it ! To me, also, a whole 
 generation of friends has gone from the other side of 
 the water since I was there and broke kindly bread with 
 them. The Duchess of Sutherland, the good old duke, 
 Lansdowne, Ellesmere, Lady Byron, Lord and Lady 
 

<page 454>
&quot;FUGACES, ANNI LABUNTUR.&quot; 411 
 
 Amberly, Charles Kingsley, the good Quaker, Joseph 
 Sturge, all are with the shadowy train that has moved 
 on. Among them were as dear and true friends as I 
 ever had, and as pure and noble specimens of human 
 beings as God ever made. They are living somewhere 
 in intense vitality, I must believe, and you, dear doctor, 
 must not doubt. 
 
 I think about your writings a great deal, and one 
 element in them always attracts me. It is their pitiful 
 and sympathetic vein, the pity for poor, struggling hu 
 man nature. In this I feel that you must be very near 
 and dear to Him whose name is Love. 
 
 You wrote some verses once that have got into the 
 hymn-books, and have often occurred to me in my most 
 sacred hours as descriptive of the feelings with which 
 I bear the sorrows and carry the cares of life. They 
 begin, 
 
 &quot; Love Divine, that stooped to share.&quot; 
 
 I have not all your books down here, and am haunted 
 by gaps in the verses that memory cannot make good ; 
 but it is that &quot; Love Divine &quot; which is my stay and com 
 fort and hope, as one friend after another passes be 
 yond sight and hearing. Please let me have it in your 
 handwriting. 
 
 I remember a remark you once made on spiritualism. 
 I cannot recall the words, but you spoke of it as modi 
 fying the sharp angles of Calvinistic belief, as a fog 
 does those of a landscape. I would like to talk with 
 you some time on spiritualism, and show you a collec 
 tion of very curious facts that I have acquired through 
 mediums not professional. Mr. Stowe has just been 
 wading through eight volumes of &quot; La Mystique,&quot; by 
 

<page 455>
412 FLORIDA. 
 
 Goerres, professor for forty years past in the University 
 of Munich, first of physiology and latterly of phi 
 losophy. He examines the whole cycle of abnormal 
 psychic, spiritual facts, trances, ecstasy, clairvoyance, 
 witchcraft, spiritualism, etc., etc., as shown in the Rom 
 ish miracles and the history of Europe. 
 
 I have long since come to the conclusion that the 
 marvels of spiritualism are natural, and not supernat 
 ural, phenomena, an uncommon working of natural 
 laws. I believe that the door between those in the 
 body and those out has never in any age been entirely 
 closed, and that occasional perceptions within the veil 
 are a part of the course of nature, and therefore not 
 miraculous. Of course such a phase of human experi 
 ence is very substantial ground for every kind of im 
 posture and superstition, and I have no faith whatever 
 in mediums who practice for money. In their case I 
 think the law of Moses, that forbade consulting those 
 who dealt with &quot; familiar spirits,&quot; a very wise one. 
 
 Do write some more, dear doctor. You are too well 
 off in your palace down there on the new land. Your 
 Centennial Ballad was a charming little peep ; now 
 give us a full-fledged story. Mr. Stowe sends his best 
 regards, and wishes you would read &quot; Goerres.&quot; It is 
 in French also, and he thinks the French translation 
 better than the German. 
 
 Yours ever truly, H. B. STOWE. 
 
 Writing in the autumn of 1876 to her son Charles, 
 who was at that time abroad, studying at Bonn, Mrs. 
 Stowe describes a most tempestuous passage between 
 
 1 Die Christliche Mystik, by Johann Joseph Gorres, Regensburg, 1836-42. 
 

<page 456>
WRITES POGANUC PEOPLE. 413 
 
 New York and Charleston, during which she and her 
 husband and daughters suffered so much that they 
 were ready to forswear the sea forever. The great 
 waves as they rushed, boiling and seething, past would 
 peer in at the little bull s-eye window of the state-room, 
 as if eager to swallow up ship and passengers. From 
 Charleston, however, they had a most delightful run to 
 their journey s end. She writes : &quot; We had a triumphal 
 entrance into the St. John s, and a glorious sail up the 
 river. Arriving at Mandarin, at four o clock, we found 
 all the neighbors, black as well as white, on the wharf 
 to receive us. There was a great waving of handker 
 chiefs and flags, clapping of hands and cheering, as 
 we drew near. The house was open and all ready for 
 us, and we are delighted to be once more in our beauti 
 ful Florida home.&quot; 
 
 In the following December she writes to her son : 
 &quot; I am again entangled in writing a serial, a thing I 
 never mean to do again, but the story, begun for a 
 mere Christmas brochure, grew so under my hands 
 that I thought I might as well fill it out and make a 
 book of it. It is the last thing of the kind I ever ex 
 pect to do. In it I condense my recollections of a 
 bygone era, that in which I was brought up, the ways 
 and manners of which are now as nearly obsolete as 
 the Old England of Dickens s stories is. 
 
 &quot; I am so hampered by the necessity of writing this 
 story, that I am obliged to give up company and visit 
 ing of all kinds and keep my strength for it. I hope 
 I may be able to finish it, as I greatly desire to do so, 
 but I begin to feel that I am not so strong as I used 
 to be. Your mother is an old woman, Charley mine, 
 

<page 457>
414 FLORIDA. 
 
 and it is best she should give up writing before people 
 are tired of reading her. 
 
 &quot; I would much rather have written another such a 
 book as Footsteps of the Master/ but all, even the 
 religious papers, are gone mad on serials. Serials they 
 demand and will have, and I thought, since this genera 
 tion will listen to nothing but stories, why not tell 
 them ? &quot; 
 
 The book thus referred to was &quot; Poganuc People,&quot; 
 that series of delightful reminiscences of the New Eng 
 land life of nearly a century ago, that has proved so 
 fascinating to many thousands of readers. It was pub 
 lished in 1878, and, as Mrs. Stowe foresaw, was her last 
 literary undertaking of any length, though for several 
 years afterwards she wrote occasional short stories and 
 articles. 
 
 In January, 1879, she wrote from Mandarin to Dr. 
 Holmes : 
 
 DEAR DOCTOR, I wish I could give to you and 
 Mrs. Holmes the exquisite charm of this morning. My 
 window is wide open ; it is a lovely, fresh, sunny day, 
 and a great orange tree hung with golden balls closes 
 the prospect from my window. The tree is about thirty 
 feet high, and its leaves fairly glisten in the sunshine. 
 
 I sent &quot; Poganuc People &quot; to you and Mrs. Holmes 
 as being among the few who know those old days. It 
 is an extremely quiet story for these sensational days, 
 when heaven and earth seem to be racked for a thrill ; 
 but as I get old I do love to think of those quiet, simple 
 times when there was not a poor person in the parish, 
 and the changing glories of the year were the only 
 

<page 458>

 spectacle. We, that is the professor and myself, have 
 been reading with much interest Motley s Memoir. 
 That was a man to be proud of, a beauty, too (by your 
 engraving). I never had the pleasure of a personal 
 acquaintance. 
 
 I feel with you that we have come into the land of 
 leave-taking. Hardly a paper but records the death 
 of some of Mr. Stowe s associates. But the river is not 
 so black as it seems, and there are clear days when the 
 opposite shore is plainly visible, and now and then we 
 catch a strain of music, perhaps even a gesture of 
 recognition. They are thinking of us, without doubt, 
 on the other side. My daughters and I have been 
 reading &quot; Elsie Venner &quot; again. Elsie is one of my 
 especial friends, poor, dear child ! and all your 
 theology in that book I subscribe to with both hands. 
 
 Does not the Bible plainly tell us of a time when 
 there shall be no more pain ? That is to be the end 
 and crown of the Messiah s mission, when God shall 
 wipe all tears away. My face is set that way, and yours, 
 too, I trust and believe. 
 
 Mr. Stowe sends hearty and affectionate remem 
 brance both to you and Mrs. Holmes, and I am, as ever, 
 truly yours, H. B. STOWE. 
 
 About this time Mrs. Stowe paid a visit to her 
 brother Charles, at Newport, Fla., and, continuing her 
 journey to New Orleans, was made to feel how little of 
 bitterness towards her was felt by the best class of 
 Southerners. In both New Orleans and Tallahassee she 
 was warmly welcomed, and tendered public receptions 
 that gave equal pleasure to her and to the throngs of 
 

<page 459>
416 FLORIDA. 
 
 cultivated people who attended them. She was also 
 greeted everywhere with intense enthusiasm by the 
 colored people, who, whenever they knew of her com 
 ing, thronged the railway stations in order to obtain 
 a glimpse of her whom they venerated above all 
 women. 
 
 The return to her Mandarin home each succeeding 
 winter was always a source of intense pleasure to this 
 true lover of nature in its brightest and tenderest moods. 
 Each recurring season was filled with new delights. 
 In December, 1879, she writes to her son, now mar 
 ried and settled as a minister in Saco, Me. : 
 
 DEAR CHILDREN, Well, we have stepped from De 
 cember to June, and this morning is sunny and dewy, 
 with a fresh sea-breeze giving life to the air. I have 
 just been out to cut a great bunch of roses and lilies, 
 though the garden is grown into such a jungle that I 
 could hardly get about in it. The cannas, and dwarf 
 bananas, and roses are all tangled together, so that I 
 can hardly thread my way among them. I never in 
 my life saw anything range and run rampant over the 
 ground as cannas do. The ground is littered with 
 fallen oranges, and the place looks shockingly untidy, 
 but so beautiful that I am quite willing to forgive its 
 disorder. 
 
 We got here Wednesday evening about nine o clock, 
 and found all the neigbors waiting to welcome us on 
 the wharf. The Meads, and Cranes, and Webbs, and 
 all the rest were there, while the black population was 
 in a frenzy of joy. Your father is quite well. The 
 sea had its usual exhilarating effect upon him. Before 
 

<page 460>
THE CHURCH AT MANDARIN. 417 
 
 we left New York he was quite meek, and exhibited 
 such signs of grace and submission that I had great 
 hopes of him. He promised to do exactly as I told 
 him, and stated that he had entire confidence in my 
 guidance. What woman could n t call such a spirit 
 evidence of being prepared for speedy translation ? I 
 was almost afraid he could not be long for this world. 
 But on the second day at sea his spirits rose, and his 
 appetite reasserted itself. He declared in loud tones 
 how well he felt, and quite resented my efforts to take 
 care of him. I reminded him of his gracious vows and 
 promises in the days of his low spirits, but to no effect. 
 The fact is, his self-will has not left him yet, and I have 
 now no fear of his immediate translation. He is going 
 to preach for us this morning. 
 
 The last winter passed in this well-loved Southern 
 home was that of 1883-84, for the following season 
 Professor Stowe s health was in too precarious a state 
 to permit him to undertake the long journey from 
 Hartford. By this time one of Mrs. Stowe s fondest 
 hopes had been realized ; and, largely through her 
 efforts, Mandarin had been provided with a pretty little 
 Episcopal church, to which was attached a comfortable 
 rectory, and over which was installed a regular clergy 
 man. 
 
 In January, 1884, Mrs. Stowe writes : 
 &quot; Mandarin looks very gay and airy now with its 
 new villas, and our new church and rectory. Our 
 minister is perfect. I wish you could know him. He 
 wants only physical strength. In everything else he is 
 all one could ask. 
 

<page 461>
418 FLORIDA. 
 
 &quot; It is a bright, lovely morning, and four orange- 
 pickers are busy gathering our fruit. Our trees on the 
 bluff have done better than any in Florida. 
 
 &quot; This winter I study nothing but Christ s life. First 
 I read Farrar s account and went over it carefully. 
 Now I am reading Geikie. It keeps my mind steady, 
 and helps me to bear the languor and pain, of which 
 I have more than usual this winter.&quot;

 OLDTOWN FOLKS, 1869. 
 
 PROFESSOR STOWE THE ORIGINAL OF &quot; HARRY &quot; IN &quot; OLDTOWN 
 FOLKS.&quot; PROFESSOR STOWE S LETTER TO GEORGE ELIOT. HER 
 REMARKS ON THE SAME. PROFESSOR STOWE S NARRATIVE OF HIS 
 YOUTHFUL ADVENTURES IN THE WORLD OF SPIRITS. PROFESSOR 
 STOWE S INFLUENCE ON MRS. STOWE S LITERARY LIFE. GEORGE 
 ELIOT ON &quot; OLDTOWN FOLKS.&quot; 
 
 THIS biography would be signally incomplete without 
 some mention of the birth, childhood, early associations, 
 and very peculiar and abnormal psychological experi 
 ences of Professor Stowe. Aside from the fact of Dr. 
 Stowe s being Mrs. Stowe s husband, and for this reason 
 entitled to notice in any sketch of her life, however 
 meagre, he is the original of the &quot; visionary boy &quot; in 
 &quot;Oldtown Folks;&quot; and &quot; Oldtown Fireside Stories&quot; 
 embody the experiences of his childhood and youth 
 among the grotesque and original characters of his na 
 tive town. 
 
 March 26, 1882, Professor Stowe wrote the follow 
 ing characteristic letter to Mrs. Lewes : 
 
 MRS. LEWES, I fully sympathize with you in your 
 disgust with Hume and the professing mediums gener- 
 ally. 
 
 Hume spent his boyhood in my father s native town, 
 among my relatives and acquaintances, and he was a 
 

<page 463>
420 OLDTOWN FOLKS. 
 
 disagreeable, nasty boy. But he certainly has qualities 
 which science has not yet explained, and some of his 
 doings are as real as they are strange. My interest 
 in the subject of spiritualism arises from the fact of my 
 own experience, more than sixty years ago, in my early 
 childhood. I then never thought of questioning the 
 objective reality of all I saw, and supposed that every 
 body else had the same experience. Of what this ex 
 perience was you may gain some idea from certain pas 
 sages in &quot; Oldtown Folks.&quot; 
 
 The same experiences continue yet, but with serious 
 doubts as to the objectivity of the scenes exhibited. 
 I have noticed that people who have remarkable and 
 minute answers to prayer, such as Stilling, Franke, 
 Lavater, are for the most part of this peculiar tempera 
 ment. Is it absurd to suppose that some peculiarity in 
 the nervous system, in the connecting link between soul 
 and body, may bring some, more than others, into an 
 almost abnormal contact with the spirit - world (for 
 example, Jacob Boehme and Swedenborg), and that, 
 too, without correcting their faults, or making them 
 morally better than others ? Allow me to say that I 
 have always admired the working of your mind, there 
 is about it such a perfect uprightness and uncalculating 
 honesty. I think you are a better Christian without

 his Goethe labors.

 years. In 1830 I got hold of his &quot; Faust,&quot; and for two

 gloomy, dreary November days, while riding through 
 the woods of New Hampshire in an old-fashioned stage 
 coach, to enter upon a professorship in Dartmouth Col 
 lege, I was perfectly dissolved by it. 
 
 Sincerely yours, C. E. STOWE. 
 
 In a letter to Mrs. Stowe, written June 24, 1872, 
 Mrs. Lewes aUudes to Professor Stowe s letter as fol 
 lows : &quot; Pray give my special thanks to the professor 
 for his letter. His handwriting, which does really look 
 like Arabic, a very graceful character, surely, hap 
 pens to be remarkably legible to me, and I did not 
 hesitate over a single word. Some of the words, as 
 expressions of fellowship, were very precious to me, and 
 I hold it very good of him to write to me that best sort 
 of encouragement. I was much impressed with the fact 
 which you have told me that he was the original 
 of the &quot; visionary boy &quot; in &quot; Oldtown Folks ; &quot; and it 
 must be deeply interesting to talk with him on his ex 
 perience. Perhaps I am inclined, under the influence 
 of the facts, physiological and psychological, which have 
 been gathered of late years, to give larger place to the 
 interpretation of vision-seeing as subjective than the 
 professor would approve. It seems difficult to limit - 
 at least to limit with any precision the possibility of 
 confounding sense by impressions derived from inward 
 conditions with those which are directly dependent on 
 external stimulus. In fact, the division between within 
 and without in this sense seems to become every year a 
 more subtle and bewildering problem.&quot; 
 
 In 1834, while Mr. Stowe was a professor in Lane 
 Theological Seminary at Cincinnati, Ohio, he wrote out 
 

<page 465>
422 OLD TOWN FOLKS. 
 
 a history of his youthful adventures in the spirit-world, 
 from which the following extracts are taken : 
 
 &quot; I have often thought I would communicate to some 
 scientific physician a particular account of a most singu 
 lar delusion under which I lived from my earliest in 
 fancy till the fifteenth or sixteenth year of my age, and 
 the effects of which remain very distinctly now that I 
 am past thirty. 
 
 &quot; The facts are of such a nature as to be indelibly 
 impressed upon my mind they appear to me to be curi 
 ous, and well worth the attention of the psychologist. 
 I regard the occurrences in question as the more remark 
 able because I cannot discover that I possess either 
 taste or talent for fiction or poetry. I have barely 
 imagination enough to enjoy, with a high degree of 
 relish, the works of others in this department of litera 
 ture, but have never felt able or disposed to engage in 
 that sort of writing myself. On the contrary, my style 
 has always been remarkable for its dry, matter-of-fact 
 plainness ; my mind has been distinguished for its quick 
 ness and adaptedness to historical and literary investi 
 gations, for ardor and perseverance in pursuit of the 
 knowledge of facts, eine verstdndige Richtung, as the 
 Germans would say, rather than for any other quality ; 
 and the only talent of a higher kind which I am con 
 scious of possessing is a turn for accurate observation 
 of men and things, and a certain broad humor and 
 drollery. 
 
 &quot; From the hour of my birth I have been constitu 
 tionally feeble, as were my parents before me, and my 
 nervous system easily excitable. With care, however, 
 I have kept myself in tolerable health, and my life has 
 

<page 466>

<page 467>

<page 468>
PROFESSOR STOWE S SPIRIT-LORE. 423 
 
 been an industrious one, for my parents were poor 
 and I have always been obliged to labor for my liveli 
 hood. 
 
 &quot; With these preliminary remarks, I proceed to the 
 curious details of my psychological history. As early 
 as I can remember anything, I can remember observing 
 a multitude of animated and active objects, which I 
 could see with perfect distinctness, moving about me, 
 and could sometimes, though seldom, hear them make 
 a rustling noise, or other articulate sounds ; but I could 
 never touch them. They were in all respects inde 
 pendent of the sense of touch, and incapable of being 
 obstructed in any way by the intervention of material 
 objects ; I could see them at any distance, and through 
 any intervening object, with as much ease and distinct 
 ness as if they were in the room with me, and directly 
 before my eyes. I could see them passing through the 
 floors, and the ceilings, and the walls of the house, from 
 one apartment to another, in all directions, without a 
 door, or a keyhole, or crevice being open to admit them. 
 I could follow them with my eyes to any distance, or 
 directly through or just beneath the surface, or up and 
 down, in the midst of boards and timbers and bricks, or 
 whatever else would stop the motion or intercept the 
 visibleness of all other objects. These appearances oc 
 casioned neither surprise nor alarm, except when they 
 assumed some hideous and frightful form, or exhibited 
 some menacing gesture, for I became acquainted with 
 them as soon as with any of the objects of sense. As 
 to the reality of their existence and the harmlessness of 
 their character, I knew no difference between them and 
 any other of the objects which met my eye. They were 
 

<page 469>
424 OLD TOWN FOLKS. 
 
 as familiar to me as the forms of my parents and my 
 brother ; they made up a part of my daily existence, 
 and were as really the subjects of my consciousness as 
 the little bench on which I sat in the corner by my 
 mother s knee, or the wheels and sticks and strings with 
 which I amused myself upon the floor. I indeed recog 
 nized a striking difference between them and the things 
 which I could feel and handle, but to me this difference 
 was no more a matter of surprise than that which I ob 
 served between my mother and the black woman who 
 so often came to work for her ; or between my infant 
 brother and the little spotted dog Brutus of which I 
 was so fond. There was no time, or place, or circum- 
 .stance, in which they did not occasionally make their 
 .appearance. Solitude and silence, however, were more 
 favorable to their appearance than company and con 
 versation. They were more pleased with candle-light 
 than the daylight. They were most numerous, distinct, 
 .and active when I was alone and in the dark, especially 
 when my mother had laid me in bed and returned to 
 her own room with the candle. At such times, I al 
 ways expected the company of my serial visitors, and 
 counted upon it to amuse me till I dropped asleep. 
 Whenever they failed to make their appearance, as was 
 sometimes the case, I felt lonely and discontented. I 
 kept up a lively conversation with them, not by lan 
 guage or by signs, for the attempt on my part to speak 
 or move would at once break the charm and drive them 
 away in a fret, but by a peculiar sort of spiritual inter 
 communion. 
 
 &quot; When their attention was directed towards me, I 
 could feel and respond to all their thoughts and feel- 
 

<page 470>
RATIONAL PHANTOMS. 425 
 
 ings, and was conscious that they could in the same 
 manner feel and respond to mine. Sometimes they 
 would take no notice of me, but carry on a brisk con 
 versation among themselves, principally by looks and 
 gestures, with now and then an audible word. In fact, 
 there were but few with whom I was very familiar. 
 These few were much more constant and uniform in 
 their visits than the great multitude, who were fre 
 quently changing, and too much absorbed in their own 
 concerns to think much of me. I scarcely know how I 
 can give an idea of their form and general appearance, 
 for there are no objects in the material world with 
 which I can compare them, and no language adapted to 
 an accurate description of their peculiarities. They 
 exhibited all possible combinations of size, shape, pro 
 portion, and color, but their most usual appearance was 
 with the human form and proportion, but under a 
 shadowy outline that seemed just ready to melt into the 
 invisible air, and sometimes liable to the most sudden 
 and grotesque changes, and with a uniform darkly 
 bluish color spotted with brown, or brownish white. 
 This was the general appearance of the multitude ; but 
 there were many exceptions to this description, particu 
 larly among my more welcome and familiar visitors, as 
 will be seen in the sequel. 
 
 &quot; Besides these rational and generally harmless beings, 
 there was another set of objects which never varied in 
 their form or qualities, and were always mischievous 
 and terrible. The fact of their appearance depended 
 very much on the state of my health and feelings. If 
 I was well and cheerful they seldom troubled me ; but 
 when sick or depressed they were sure to obtrude their 
 

<page 471>
426 OLD TOWN FOLKS. 
 
 hateful presence upon me. These were a sort of heavy 
 clouds floating about overhead, of a black color, spotted 
 with brown, in the shape of a very flaring inverted tun 
 nel without a nozzle, and from ten to thirty or forty feet 
 in diameter. They floated from place to place in great 
 numbers, and in all directions, with a strong and steady 
 progress, but with a tremulous, quivering, internal mo 
 tion that agitated them in every part. 
 
 &quot; Whenever they appproached, the rational phantoms 
 were thrown into great consternation ; and well it might 
 be, for if a cloud touched any part of one of the ra 
 tional phantoms it immediately communicated its own 
 color and tremulous motion to the part it touched. 
 
 &quot; In spite of all the efforts and convulsive struggles 
 of the unhappy victim, this color and motion slowly, but 
 steadily and uninteruptedly, proceeded to diffuse itself 
 over every part of the body, and as fast as it did so the 
 body was drawn into the cloud and became a part of its 
 substance. It was indeed a fearful sight to see the 
 contortions, the agonizing efforts, of the poor creatures 
 who had been touched by one of these awful clouds, 
 and were dissolving and melting into it by inches with 
 out the possibility of escape or resistance. 
 
 &quot; This was the only visible object that had the least 
 power over the phantoms, and this was evidently com 
 posed of the same material as themselves. The forms 
 and actions of all these phantoms varied very much 
 with the state of my health and animal spirits, but I 
 never could discover that the surrounding material ob 
 jects had any influence upon them, except in this one 
 particular, namely, if I saw them in a neat, well fur 
 nished room, there was a neatness and polish in their 
 

<page 472>
PHANTOMS RISING AS THE MISTS. 427 
 
 form and motions ; and, on the contrary, if I was in an 
 unfinished, rough apartment, there was a corresponding 
 rudeness and roughness in my serial visitors. A cor 
 responding difference was visible when I saw them in 
 the woods or in the meadows, upon the water or upon 
 the ground, in the air or among the stars. 
 
 &quot; Every different apartment which I occupied had a 
 different set of phantoms, and they always had a de 
 gree of correspondence to the circumstances in which 
 they were seen. (It should be noted, however, that it 
 was not so much the place where the phantoms them 
 selves appeared to me to be, that affected their forms 
 and movements, as the place in which I myself actually 
 was while observing them. The apparent locality of 
 the phantoms, it is true, had some influence, but my 
 own actual locality had much more.) 
 
 &quot; Thus far I have attempted only a general outline 
 of these curious experiences. I will now proceed to a 
 detailed account of several particular incidents, for the 
 sake of illustrating the general statements already 
 made. I select a few from manifestations without 
 number. I am able to ascertain dates from the follow 
 ing circumstances : 
 
 &quot;I was born in April, 1802, and my father died in 
 July, 1808, after suffering for more than a year from 
 a lingering organic disease. Between two and three 
 years before his death he removed from the house in 
 which I was born to another at a little distance from it. 
 What occurred, therefore, before my father s last sick 
 ness, must have taken place during the first five years 
 of my life, and whatever took place before the removal 
 of the family must have taken place during the first 
 

<page 473>
428 OLDTOWN FOLKS. 
 
 three years of my life. Before the removal of the fam 
 ily I slept in a small upper chamber in the front part 
 of the house, where I was generally alone for several 
 hours in the evening and morning. Adjoining this 
 room, and opening into it by a very small door, was a 
 low, dark, narrow, unfinished closet, which was open 
 on the other side into a ruinous, old chaise-house. 
 This closet was a famous place for the gambols of the 
 phantoms, but of their forms and actions I do not now 
 retain any very distinct recollection. I only remember 
 that I was very careful not to do anything that I 
 thought would be likely to offend them ; yet otherwise 
 their presence caused me no uneasiness, and was not at 
 all disagreeable to me. 
 
 &quot; The first incident of which I have a distinct recol 
 lection was the following : 
 
 &quot; One night, as I was lying alone in my chamber 
 with my little dog Brutus snoring beside my bed, there 
 came out of the closet a very large Indian woman and 
 a very small Indian man, with a huge bass-viol between 
 them. The woman was dressed in a large, loose, black 
 gown, secured around her waist by a belt of the same 
 material, and on her head she wore a high, dark gray 
 fur cap, shaped somewhat like a lady s muff, orna 
 mented with a row of covered buttons in front, and 
 open towards the bottom, showing a red lining. The 
 man was dressed in a shabby, black-colored overcoat 
 and a little round, black hat that fitted closely to his 
 head. They took no notice of me, but were rather ill- 
 natured towards each other, and seemed to be disputing 
 for the possession of the bass-viol. The man snatched 
 it away and struck upon it a few harsh, hollow notes, 
 

<page 474>
GHOST-MUSIC. 429 
 
 which I distinctly heard, and which seemed to vibrate 
 through my whole body, with a strange, stinging sensa 
 tion. The woman then took it and appeared to play 
 very intently and much to her own satisfaction, but 
 without producing any sound that was perceptible by 
 me. They soon left the chamber, and I saw them go 
 down into the back kitchen, where they sat and played 
 and talked with my mother. It was only when the 
 man took the bow that I could hear the harsh, abrupt, 
 disagreeable sounds of the instrument. At length they 
 arose, went out of the back door, and sprang upon a 
 large heap of straw and unthreshed beans, and disap 
 peared with a strange, rumbling sound. This vision 
 was repeated night after night with scarcely any varia 
 tion while we lived in that house, and once, and once 
 only, after the family had removed to the other house. 
 The only thing that seemed to me unaccountable and 
 that excited my curiosity was that there should be such 
 a large heap of straw and beans before the door every 
 night, when 1 could see nothing of it in the daytime. 
 I frequently crept out of bed and stole softly down into 
 the kitchen, and peeped out of the door to see if it was 
 there very early in the morning. 
 
 &quot; I attempted to make some inquiries of my mother, 
 but as I was not as yet very skillful in the use of lan 
 guage, I could get no satisfaction out of her answers, 
 and could see that my questions seemed to distress her. 
 At first she took little notice of what I said, regarding 
 it no doubt as the meaningless prattle of a thoughtless 
 child. My persistence, however, seemed to alarm her, 
 and I suppose that she feared for my sanity. I soon 
 desisted from asking anything further, and shut myself 
 

<page 475>
430 OLDTOWN FOLKS. 
 
 more and more within myself. One night, very soon 
 after the removal, when the house was still, and all the 
 family were in bed, these unearthly musicians once 
 made their appearance in the kitchen of the new house, 
 and after looking around peevishly, and sitting with a 
 discontented frown and in silence, they arose and went 
 out of the back door, and sprang on a pile of corn 
 stalks, and I saw them no more. 
 
 &quot; Our new dwelling was a low-studded house of only 
 one story, and, instead of an upper chamber, I now 
 occupied a bedroom that opened into the kitchen. 
 Within this bedroom, directly on the left hand of the 
 door as you entered from the kitchen, was the stair 
 case which led to the garret ; and, as the room was 
 unfinished, some of the boards which inclosed the stair 
 case were too short, and left a considerable space be 
 tween them and the ceiling. One of these open spaces 
 was directly in front of my bed, so that when I lay 
 upon my pillow my face was opposite to it. Every 
 night, after I had gone to bed and the candle was re 
 moved, a very pleasant-looking human face would peer 
 at me over the top of that board, and gradually press 
 forward his head, neck, shoulders, and finally his whole 
 body as far as the waist, through the opening, and 
 then, smiling upon me with great good-nature, would 
 withdraw in the same manner in which he had entered. 
 He was a great favorite of mine ; for though we neither 
 of us spoke, we perfectly understood, and were entirely 
 devoted to, each other. It is a singular fact that the 
 features of this favorite phantom bore a very close 
 resemblance to those of a boy older than myself whom 
 I feared and hated : still the resemblance was so strong 
 that I called him by the same name, Harvey. 
 

<page 476>
HARVEY. 431 
 
 &quot; Harvey s visits were always expected and always 
 pleasant ; but sometimes there were visitations of an 
 other sort, odious and frightful. One of these I will 
 relate as a specimen of the rest. 
 
 &quot; One night, after I had retired to bed and was look 
 ing for Harvey, I observed an unusual number of the 
 tunnel-shaped tremulous clouds already described, and 
 they seemed intensely black and strongly agitated. 
 This alarmed me exceedingly, and I had a terrible feel 
 ing that something awful was going to happen. It was 
 not long before I saw Harvey at his accustomed place, 
 cautiously peeping at me through the aperture, with an 
 expression of pain and terror on his countenance. He 
 seemed to warn me to be on my guard, but was afraid 
 to put his head into the room lest he should be touched 
 by one of the clouds, which were every moment grow 
 ing thicker and more numerous. Harvey soon with 
 drew and left me alone. On turning my eyes towards 
 the left-hand wall of the room, I thought I saw at an 
 immense distance below me the regions of the damned, 
 as I had heard them pictured in sermons. From this 
 awful world of horror the tunnel-shaped clouds were 
 ascending, and I perceived that they were the principal 
 instruments of torture in these gloomy abodes. These 
 regions were at such an immense distance below me 
 that I could obtain but a very indistinct view of the 
 inhabitants, who were very numerous and exceedingly 
 active. Near the surface of the earth, and as it seemed 
 to me but a little distance from my bed, I saw four or 
 five sturdy, resolute devils endeavoring to carry off an 
 unprincipled and dissipated man in the neighborhood, 
 by the name of Brown, of whom I had stood in terror 
 

<page 477>
432 OLDTOWN FOLKS. 
 
 for years. These devils I saw were very different from 
 the common representations. They had neither red 
 faces, nor horns, nor hoofs, nor tails. They were in all 
 respects stoutly built and well-dressed gentlemen. The 
 only peculiarity that I noted in their appearance was as 
 to their heads. Their faces and necks were perfectly 
 bare, without hair or flesh, and of a uniform sky-blue 
 color, like the ashes of burnt paper before it falls to 
 pieces, and of a certain glossy smoothness. 
 
 &quot; As I looked on, full of eagerness, the devils strug 
 gled to force Brown down with them, and Brown 
 struggled with the energy of desperation to save him 
 self from their grip, and it seemed that the human was 
 likely to prove too strong for the infernal. In this 
 emergency one of the devils, panting for breath and 
 covered with perspiration, beckoned to a strong, thick 
 cloud that seemed to understand him perfectly, and, 
 whirling up to Brown, touched his hand. Brown re 
 sisted stoutly, and struck out right and left at the cloud 
 most furiously, but the usual effect was produced, 
 the hand grew black, quivered, and seemed to be melt 
 ing into the cloud ; then the arm, by slow degrees, and 
 then the head and shoulders. At this instant Brown, 
 collecting all his energies for one desperate effort, 
 sprang at once inta the centre of the cloud, tore it 
 asunder, and descended to the ground, exclaiming, with 
 a hoarse, furious voice that grated on my ear, There, 
 I ve got out ; dam me if I have n t ! This was the 
 first word that had been spoken through the whole 
 horrible scene. It was the first time I had ever seen a 
 cloud fail to produce its appropriate result, and it terri 
 fied me so that I trembled from head to foot. The 
 

<page 478>
BROWN AND THE DEVILS. 433 
 
 devils, however, did not seem to be in the least dis 
 couraged. One of them, who seemed to be the leader, 
 went away and quickly returned bringing with him an 
 enormous pair of rollers fixed in an iron frame, such 
 as are used in iron-mills for the purpose of rolling out 
 and slitting bars of iron, except instead of being turned 
 by machinery, each roller was turned by an immense 
 crank. Three of the devils now seized Brown and put 
 his feet to the rollers, while two others stood, one at 
 each crank, and began to roll him in with a steady 
 strain that was entirely irresistible. Not a word was 
 spoken, not a sound was heard ; but the fearful strug 
 gles and terrified, agonizing looks of Brown were more 
 than I could endure. I sprang from my bed and ran 
 through the kitchen into the room where my parents 
 slept, and entreated that they would permit me to spend 
 the remainder of the night with them. After consider 
 able parleying they assured me that nothing could hurt 
 me, and advised me to go back to bed. I replied that 
 I was not afraid of their hurting me, but I could n t 
 bear to see them acting so with C. Brown. Poh ! 
 poh ! you foolish boy, replied my father, sternly. 
 You ve only been dreaming ; go right back to bed, 
 or I shall have to whip you. Knowing that there was 
 no other alternative, I trudged back through the kitchen 
 with all the courage I could muster, cautiously entered 
 my room, where I found everything quiet, there being 
 neither cloud, nor devil, nor anything of the kind to 
 be seen, and getting into bed I slept quietly till morn 
 ing. The next day I was rather sad and melancholy, 
 but kept all my troubles to myself, through fear of 
 Brown. This happened before my father s sickness, 
 

<page 479>
434 OLDTOWN FOLKS. 
 
 and consequently between the four and six years of 
 my age. 
 
 &quot; During my father s sickness and after his death I 
 lived with my grandmother ; and when I had removed 
 to her house I forever lost sight of Harvey. I still con 
 tinued to sleep alone for the most part, but in a neatly 
 furnished upper chamber. Across the corner of the 
 chamber, opposite to and at a little distance from the 
 head of my bed, there was a closet in the form of an 
 old-fashioned buffet. After going to bed, on looking 
 at the door of this closet, I could see at a great distance 
 from it a pleasant meadow, terminated by a beautiful 
 little grove. Out of this grove, and across this meadow, 
 a charming little female figure would advance, about 
 eight inches high and exquisitely proportioned, dressed 
 in a loose black silk robe, with long, smooth black hair 
 parted up her head and hanging loose over her shoul 
 ders. She would come forward with a slow and regular 
 step, becoming more distinctly visible as she approached 
 nearer, till she came even with the surface of the closet 
 door, when she would smile upon me, raise her hands to 
 her head and draw them down on each side of her face, 
 suddenly turn round, and go off at a rapid trot. The 
 moment she turned I could see a good-looking mulatto 
 man, rather smaller than herself, following directly in 
 her wake and trotting off after her. This was gener 
 ally repeated two or three times before I went to sleep. 
 The features of the mulatto bore some resemblance to 
 those of the Indian man with the bass-viol, but were 
 much more mild and agreeable. 
 
 &quot; I awoke one bright, moonlight night, and found a 
 

<page 480>
FAIRIES. 435 
 
 large, full-length human skeleton of an ashy-blue color 
 in bed with me ! I screamed out with fright, and soon 
 summoned the family around me. I refused to tell the 
 cause of my alarm, but begged permission to occupy 
 another bed, which was granted. 
 
 &quot; For the remainder of the night I slept but little ; 
 but I saw upon the window-stools companies of little 
 fairies, about six inches high, in white robes, gamboling 
 and dancing with incessant merriment. Two of them, 
 a male and female, rather taller than the rest, were dig 
 nified with a crown and sceptre. They took the kind 
 est notice of me, smiled upon me with great benignity, 
 and seemed to assure me of their protection. I was 
 soothed and cheered by their presence, though after all 
 there was a sort of sinister and selfish expression in 
 their countenances which prevented my placing implicit 
 confidence in them. 
 
 &quot; Up to this time I had never doubted the real exist 
 ence of these phantoms, nor had I ever suspected that 
 other people had not seen them as distinctly as myself. 
 I now, however, began to discover with no little anxiety 
 that my friends had little or no knowledge of the serial 
 beings among whom I have spent my whole life ; that 
 my allusions to them were not understood, and all com 
 plaints respecting them were laughed at. I had never 
 been disposed to say much about them, and this dis 
 covery confirmed me in my silence. It did not, how 
 ever, affect my own belief, or lead me to suspect that my 
 imaginations were not realities. 
 
 &quot; During the whole of this period I took great pleas 
 ure in walking out alone, particularly in the evening. 
 The most lonely fields, the woods, and the banks of the 
 

<page 481>
436 OLDTOWN FOLKS. 
 
 river, and other places most completely secluded, were 
 my favorite resorts, for there I could enjoy the sight of 
 innumerable serial beings of all sorts, without interrup 
 tion. Every object, even every shaking leaf, seemed to 
 me to be animated by some living soul, whose nature in 
 some degree corresponded to its habitation. I spent 
 much of my life in these solitary rambles ; there were 
 particular places to which I gave names, and visited 
 them at regular intervals. Moonlight was particularly 
 agreeable to me, but most of all I enjoyed a thick, 
 foggy night. At times, during these walks, I would be 
 excessively oppressed by an indefinite and deep feeling 
 of melancholy. Without knowing why, I would be so 
 unhappy as to wish myself annihilated, and suddenly it 
 would occur to me that my friends at home were suffer 
 ing some dreadful calamity, and so vivid would be the 
 impression, that I would hasten home with all speed to 
 see what had taken place. At such seasons I felt a 
 morbid love for my friends that would almost burn up 
 my soul, and yet, at the least provocation from them, I 
 would fly into an uncontrollable passion and foam like 
 a little fury. I was called a dreadful-tempered boy ; 
 but the Lord knows that I never occasioned pain to any 
 animal, whether human or brutal, without suffering un 
 told agonies in consequence of it. I cannot, even now, 
 without feelings of deep sorrow, call to mind the alter 
 nate fits of corroding melancholy, irritation, and bitter 
 remorse which I then endured. These fits of melan 
 choly were most constant and oppressive during the 
 autumnal months. 
 
 &quot; I very early learned to read, and soon became im 
 moderately attached to books. In the Bible I read the 
 

<page 482>
A CHILD S READING. 437 
 
 first chapters of Job, and parts of Ezekiel, Daniel, and 
 Revelation, with most intense delight, and with such 
 frequency that I could repeat large portions from 
 memory long before the age at which boys in the coun 
 try are usually able to read plain sentences. The first 
 large book besides the Bible that I remember reading 
 was Morse s History of New England/ which I de 
 voured with insatiable greediness, particularly those 
 parts which relate to Indian wars and witchcraft. I 
 was in the habit of applying to my grandmother for 
 explanations, and she would relate to me, while I lis 
 tened with breathless attention, long stories from Ma 
 ther s Magnalia or (Mag-nilly, as she used to call it), 
 a work which I earnestly longed to read, but of w r hich 
 I never got sight till after my twentieth year. Very 
 early there fell into my hands an old school-book, called 
 The Art of Speaking/ containing numerous extracts 
 from Milton and Shakespeare. There was little else in 
 the book that interested me, but these extracts from the 
 two great English poets, though there were many things 
 in them that I did not well understand, I read again 
 and again, with increasing pleasure at every perusal, till 
 I had nearly committed them to memory, and almost 
 thumbed the old book into nonenity. But of all the 
 books that I read at this period, there was none that 
 went to my heart like Bunyan s Pilgrim s Progress. 
 I read it and re-read it night and day ; I took it to bed 
 with me and hugged it to my bosom while I slept ; every 
 different edition that I could find I seized upon and 
 read with as eager a curiosity as if it had been a new 
 story throughout ; and I read with the unspeakable 
 satisfaction of most devoutly believing that everything

 which * Honest John related was a real verity, an ac 
 tual occurrence. Oh that I could read that most inimi 
 table book once more with the same solemn conviction 
 of its literal truth, that I might once more enjoy the 
 same untold ecstacy ! 
 
 &quot; One other remark it seems proper to make before 
 I proceed further to details. The appearance, and 
 especially the motions, of my aerial visitors were inti 
 mately connected, either as cause or effect, I cannot 
 determine which, with certain sensations of my own. 
 Their countenances generally expressed pleasure or pain, 
 complaisance or anger, according to the mood of my 
 own mind : if they moved from place to place without 
 moving their limbs, with that gliding motion appro 
 priate to spirits, I felt in my stomach that peculiar tick 
 ling sensation which accompanies a rapid, progressive 
 movement through the air ; and if they went off with 
 an uneasy trot, I felt an unpleasant jarring through my 
 frame. Their appearance was always attended with 
 considerable effort and fatigue on my part : the more 
 distinct and vivid they were, the more would my fatigue 
 be increased ; and at such times my face was always 
 pale, and my eyes unusually sparkling and wild. This 
 continued to be the case after I became satisfied that it 
 was all a delusion of the imagination, and it so con 
 tinues to the present day.&quot; 
 
 It is not surprising that Mrs. Stowe should have felt 
 herself impelled to give literary form to an experience 
 so exceptional. Still more must this be the case when 
 the early associations of this exceptional character were 
 as amusing and interesting as they are shown forth in 
 &quot; Oldtown Fireside Stories.&quot; 
 

<page 484>
NATICK FOLK-LORE. 439 
 
 None of the incidents or characters embodied in 
 those sketches are ideal. The stories are told as they 
 came from Mr. Stowe s lips, with little or no alteration. 
 Sam Lawson was a real character. In 1874 Mr. Whit- 
 tier wrote to Mrs. Stowe : &quot; I am not able to write or 
 study much, or read books that require thought, without 
 suffering, but I have Sam Lawson lying at hand, and, 
 as Corporal Trim said of Yorick s sermon, &amp;lt;I like it 
 hugely/ 
 
 The power and literary value of these stories lie in 
 the fact that they are true to nature. Professor 
 Stowe was himself an inimitable mimic and story-teller. 
 No small proportion of Mrs. Stowe s success as a liter 
 ary woman is to be attributed to him. Not only was 
 he possessed of a bright, quick mind, but wonderful 
 retentiveness of memory. Mrs. Stowe was never at a 
 loss for reliable information on any subject as long 
 as the professor lived. He belonged to that extinct 
 species, the &quot; general scholar.&quot; His scholarship was not 
 critical in the modern sense of the word, but in the 
 main accurate, in spite of his love for the marvelous. 
 
 It is not out of place to give a little idea of his 
 power in character-painting, as it shows how suggestive 
 his conversation and letters must have been to a mind 
 like that of Mrs. Stowe : 
 
 NATICK, July 14, 1839. 
 
 I have had a real good time this week writing my 
 oration. I have strolled over my old walking places, 
 and found the same old stone walls, the same old foot 
 paths through the rye-fields, the same bends in the 
 river, the same old bullfrogs with their green spectacles 
 on, the same old terrapins sticking up their heads and

 bowing as I go by ; and nothing was wanting but my 
 wife to talk with to make all complete. ... I have 
 had some rare talks with old uncle &quot; Jaw &quot; Bacon, and 
 other old characters, which you ought to have heard. 
 The Curtises have been flooding Uncle &quot;Jaw s&quot; mead 
 ows, and he is in a great stew about it. He says : 
 &quot;I took and tell d your Uncle Izic to tell them ere 
 Curtises that if the Devil did n t git em far flowing my 
 medder arter that sort, I did n t see no use o ? havin any 
 Devil.&quot; &quot; Have you talked with the Curtises yourself ? &quot; 
 &quot; Yes, hang the sarcy dogs ! and they took and tell d 
 me that they d take and flow clean up to my front 
 door, and make me go out and in in a boat.&quot; &quot; Why 
 don t you go to law ? &quot; &quot; Oh, they keep alterin and er 
 tinkerin -up the laws so here in Massachusetts that a 
 body can t git no damage fur flowing ; they think cold 
 water can t hurt nobody.&quot; 
 
 Mother and Aunt Nabby each keep separate estab 
 lishments. First Aunt Nabby gets up in the morning 
 and examines the sink, to see whether it leaks and rots 
 the beam. She then makes a little fire, gets her little 
 teapot of bright shining tin, and puts into it a tea- 
 spoonful of black tea, and so prepares her breakfast. 
 
 By this time mother comes creeping down-stairs, like 
 an old tabby-cat out of the ash-hole ; and she kind o 
 doubts and reckons whether or no she had better try to 
 git any breakfast, bein as she s not much appetite this 
 mornin ; but she goes to the leg of bacon and cuts off 
 a little slice, reckons sh ll broil it ; then goes and looks 
 at the coffee-pot and reckons sh ll have a little coffee ; 
 don t exactly know whether it s good for her, but she 
 don t drink much. So while Aunt Nabby is sitting 
 

<page 486>
UNCLE IKE. 441 
 
 sipping her tea and munching her bread and butter 
 with a matter-of-fact certainty and marvelous satisfac 
 tion, mother goes doubting and reckoning round, like 
 Mrs. Diffidence in Doubting Castle, till you see rising 
 up another little table in another corner of the room, 
 with a good substantial structure of broiled ham and 
 coffee, and a boiled egg or two, with various et ceteras, 
 which Mrs. Diffidence, after many desponding ejacula 
 tions, finally sits down to, and in spite of all presenti 
 ments makes them fly as nimbly as Mr. Ready-to-Halt 
 did Miss Much-afraid when he footed it so well with 
 her on his crutches in the dance on the occasion of 
 Giant Despair s overthrow. 
 
 I have thus far dined alternately with mother and 
 Aunt Susan, not having yet been admitted to Aunt 
 Nabby s establishment. There are now great talkings, 
 and congresses and consultations of the allied powers, 
 and already rumors are afloat that perhaps all will unite 
 their forces and dine at one table, especially as Harriet 
 and little Hattie are coming, and there is no knowing 
 what might come out in the papers if there should be 
 anything a little odd. 
 
 Mother is very well, thin as a hatchet and smart as 
 a steel trap ; Aunt Nabby, fat and easy as usual ; for 
 since the sink is mended, and no longer leaks and rots 
 the beam, and she has nothing to do but watch it, 
 and Uncle Bill has joined the Washingtonians and no 
 longer drinks rum, she is quite at a loss for topics of 
 worriment. 
 
 Uncle Ike has had a little touch of palsy and is 
 rather feeble. He says that his legs and arms have 
 rather gi n out, but his head and pluck are as good as 
 

<page 487>
442 OLD TOWN FOLKS. 
 
 they ever were. I told him that our sister Kate was 
 very much in the same fix, whereat he was considerably 
 affected, and opened the crack in his great pumpkin of 
 a face, displaying the same two rows of great white 
 ivories which have been my admiration from my youth 
 up. He is sixty-live years of age, and has never lost 
 a tooth, and was never in his life more than fifteen 
 miles from the spot where he was born, except once, in 
 the ever-memorable year 1819, when I was at Bradford 
 Academy. 
 
 In a sudden glow of adventurous rashness he under 
 took to go after me and bring me home for vacation ; 
 and he actually performed the whole journey of thirty 
 miles with his horse and wagon, and slept at a tavern a 
 whole night, a feat of bravery on which he has never 
 since ceased to plume himself. I well remember that 
 awful night in the tavern in the remote region of North 
 Andover. We occupied a chamber in which were two 
 beds. In the unsuspecting innocence of youth I un 
 dressed myself and got into bed as usual ; but my 
 brave and thoughtful uncle, merely divesting himself 
 of his coat, put it under his pillow, and then threw him 
 self on to the bed with his boots on his feet, and his 
 two hands resting on the rim of his hat, which he had 
 prudently placed on the apex of his stomach as he lay 
 on his back. He would n t allow me to blow out the 
 candle, but he lay there with his great white eyes 
 fixed on the ceiling, in the cool, determined manner of 
 a bold man who had made up his mind to face danger 
 and meet whatever might befall him. We escaped, 
 however, without injury, the doughty landlord and his 
 relentless sons merely demanding pay for supper, lodg-

 ing, horse-feed, and breakfast, which my valiant uncle, 
 betraying no signs of fear, resolutely paid. 
 
 Mrs. Stowe has woven this incident into chapter 
 thirty-two of &quot; Oldtown Folks/ where Uncle Ike fig 
 ures as Uncle Jacob. 
 
 Mrs. Stowe had misgivings as to the reception which 
 &quot;Oldtown Folks&quot; would meet in England, owing to 
 its distinctively New England character. Shortly after 
 the publication of the book she received the following 
 words of encouragement from Mrs. Lewes (George 
 Eliot), July 11, 1869 : - 
 
 &quot; I have received and read Oldtown Folks. I 
 think that few of your readers can have felt more inter 
 est than I have felt in that picture of an elder genera 
 tion ; for my interest in it has a double root, one in 
 my own love for our old-fashioned provincial life, which 
 had its affinities with a contemporary life, even all 
 across the Atlantic, and of which I have gathered 
 glimpses in different phases from my father and mother, 
 with their relations ; the other is my experimental ac 
 quaintance with some shades of Calvinistic orthodoxy. 
 I think your way of presenting the religious convictions 
 which are not your own, except by the way of indirect 
 fellowship, is a triumph of insight and true tolerance. 
 . . . Both Mr. Lewes and I are deeply interested in the 
 indications which the professor gives of his peculiar 
 psychological experience, and we should feel it a great 
 privilege to learn much more of it from his lips. It is 
 a rare thing to have such an opportunity of studying 
 exceptional experience in the testimony of a truthful 
 and in every way distinguished mind.&quot; 
 

<page 489>
444 OLDTOWN FOLKS. 
 
 &quot; Oldtown Folks &quot; is of interest as being undoubtedly 
 the last of Mrs. Stowe s works which will outlive the 
 generation for which it was written. Besides its intrin 
 sic merit as a work of fiction, it has a certain historic 
 value as being a faithful study of &quot; New England life 
 and character in that particular time of its history 
 which may be called the seminal period.&quot; 
 
 Whether Mrs. Stowe was far enough away from the 
 time and people she attempts to describe to &quot;make 
 (her) mind as still and passive as a looking-glass or a 
 mountain lake, and to give merely the images reflected 
 there/ is something that will in great part determine 
 the permanent value of this work. Its interest as a 
 story merely is of course ephemeral.

 THE BYRON CONTROVERSY, 1869-1870. 
 
 MRS. STOWE S STATEMENT OF HER OWN CASE. THE CIRCUMSTANCES 
 
 UNDER WHICH SHE FIRST MET LADY BYRON. LETTERS TO LADY 
 
 BYRON. LETTER TO DR. HOLMES WHEN ABOUT TO PUBLISH &quot; THE 
 TRUE STORY OF LADY BYRON S LIFE &quot; IN THE &quot; ATLANTIC.&quot; DR. 
 HOLMES S REPLY. THE CONCLUSION OF THE MATTER. 
 
 IT seems impossible to avoid the unpleasant episode 
 in Mrs. Stowe s life known as the &quot;Byron Contro 
 versy.&quot; It will be our effort to deal with the matter 
 as colorlessly as is consistent with an adequate setting 
 forth of the motives which moved Mrs. Stowe to 
 awaken this unsavory discussion. In justification of 
 her action in this matter, Mrs. Stowe says : 
 
 &quot; What interest have you and I, my brother and my 
 sister, in this short life of ours, to utter anything but 
 the truth ? Is not truth between man and man, and 
 between man and woman, the foundation on which all 
 things rest ? Have you not, every individual of you, 
 who must hereafter give an account yourself alone to 
 God, an interest to know the exact truth in this matter, 
 and a duty to perform as respects that truth ? Hear 
 me, then, while I tell you the position in which I stood, 
 and what was my course in relation to it. 
 
 &quot; A shameless attack on my friend s memory had 
 appeared in the Blackwood of July, 1869, branding 
 Lady Byron as the vilest of criminals, and recommend- 
 

<page 491>
446 THE BYRON CONTROVERSY. 
 
 ing the Guiccioli book to a Christian public as inter 
 esting from the very fact that it was the avowed pro 
 duction of Lord Byron s mistress. No efficient protest 
 was made against this outrage in England, and Littell s 
 * Living Age reprinted the 6 Blackwood article, and 
 the Harpers, the largest publishing house in America, 
 perhaps in the world, republished the book. 
 
 &quot; Its statements with those of the ( Blackwood/ 
 6 Pall Mall Gazette/ and other English periodicals 
 were being propagated through all the young reading 
 and writing world of America. I was meeting them 
 advertised in dailies, and made up into articles in maga 
 zines, and thus the generation of to-day, who had no 
 means of judging Lady Byron but by these fables of 
 her slanderers, were being foully deceived. The friends 
 who knew her personally were a small, select circle in 
 England, whom death is every day reducing. They 
 were few in number compared with the great world, and 
 were silent. I saw these foul slanders crystallizing into 
 history, uncontradicted by friends who knew her per 
 sonally, who, firm in their own knowledge of her vir 
 tues, and limited in view as aristocratic circles generally 
 are, had no idea of the width of the world they were 
 living in, and the exigency of the crisis. .When time 
 passed on and no voice was raised, I spoke.&quot; 
 
 It is hardly necessary to recapitulate, at any great 
 length, facts already so f amiliar to the reading public ; 
 it may be sufficient simply to say that after the appear 
 ance in 1868 of the Countess Guiccioli s &quot; Recollections 
 of Lord Byron,&quot; Mrs. Stowe felt herself called upon to 
 defend the memory of her friend from what she es 
 teemed to be falsehoods and slanders. To accomplish 
 

<page 492>
MRS. STOWE FIRST MEETS LADY BYRON. 447 
 
 this object, she prepared for the &quot; Atlantic Monthly &quot; 
 of September, 1869, an article, &quot; The True Story of 
 Lady Byron s Life.&quot; Speaking of her first impressions 
 of Lady Byron, Mrs. Stowe says : 
 
 &quot; I formed her acquaintance in the year 1853, dur 
 ing my first visit to England. I met her at a lunch 
 party in the house of one of her friends. When I was 
 introduced to her, I felt in a moment the words of her 
 husband : 
 
 &quot; There was awe in the homage that she drew ; 
 Her spirit seemed as seated on a throne. &quot; 
 
 It was in the fall of 1856, on the occasion of Mrs. 
 Stowe s second visit to England, as she and her sister 
 were on their way to Eversley to visit the Rev. C. 
 Kingsley, that they stopped by invitation to lunch with 
 Lady Byron at her summer residence at Ham Common, 
 near Richmond. At that time Lady Byron informed 
 Mrs. Stowe that it was her earnest desire to receive a 
 visit from her on her return, as there was a subject of 
 great importance concerning which she desired her ad 
 vice. Mrs. Stowe has thus described this interview 
 with Lady Byron : 
 
 &quot; After lunch, I retired with Lady Byron, and my 
 sister remained with her friends. I should here remark 
 that the chief subject of the conversation which ensued 
 was not entirely new to me. 
 
 &quot; In the interval between my first and second visits 
 to England, a lady who for many years had enjoyed 
 Lady Byron s friendship and confidence had, with her 
 consent, stated the case generally to me, giving some of 
 the incidents, so that I was in a manner prepared for 
 what followed. 
 

<page 493>
448 THE BYRON CONTROVERSY. 
 
 &quot; Those who accuse Lady Byron of being a person 
 fond of talking upon this subject, and apt to make un- 
 considered confidences, can have known very little of 
 her, of her reserve, and of the apparent difficulty she 
 had in speaking on subjects nearest her heart. Her 
 habitual calmness and composure of manner, her col 
 lected dignity on all occasions, are often mentioned by 
 her husband, sometimes with bitterness, sometimes with 
 admiration. He says : ( Though I accuse Lady Byron 
 of an excess of self-respect, I must in candor admit 
 that, if ever a person had excuse for an extraordinary 
 portion of it, she has, as in all her thoughts, words, and 
 deeds she is the most decorous woman that ever existed, 
 and must appear, what few I fancy could, a perfectly 
 refined gentlewoman, even to herfemme de chambre? 
 
 66 This calmness and dignity were never more mani 
 fested than in this interview. In recalling the conver 
 sation at this distance of time, I cannot remember all 
 the language used. Some particular words and forms 
 of expression I do remember, and those I give ; and in 
 other cases I give my recollection of the substance of 
 what was said. 
 
 &quot; There was something awful to me in the intensity 
 of repressed emotion which she showed as she pro 
 ceeded. The great fact upon which all turned was 
 stated in words that were unmistakable.&quot; 
 
 Mrs. Stowe goes on to give minutely Lady Byron s 
 conversation, and concludes by saying : 
 
 Of course I did not listen to this story as one who 
 was investigating its worth. I received it as truth, and 
 the purpose for which it was communicated was not to 
 

<page 494>
LADY BYRON S MEMORANDA. 449 
 
 enable me to prove it to the world, but to ask my 
 opinion whether she should show it to the world before 
 leaving it. The whole consultation was upon the as 
 sumption that she had at her command such proofs as 
 could not be questioned. Concerning what they were 
 I did not minutely inquire, only, in answer to a general 
 question, she said that she had letters and documents 
 in proof of her story. Knowing Lady Byron s strength 
 of mind, her clear-headedness, her accurate habits, and 
 her perfect knowledge of the matter, I considered her 
 judgment on this point decisive. I told her that I 
 would take the subject into consideration and give my 
 opinion in a few days. That night, after my sister and 
 myself had retired to our own apartment, I related to 
 her the whole history, and we spent the night in talk 
 ing it over. I was powerfully impressed with the jus 
 tice and propriety of an immediate disclosure; while 
 she, on the contrary, represented the fatal consequences 
 that would probably come upon Lady Byron from tak 
 ing such a step. 
 
 Before we parted the next day, I requested Lady 
 Byron to give me some memoranda of such dates and 
 outlines of the general story as would enable me better 
 to keep it in its connection, which she did. On giving 
 me the paper, Lady Byron requested me to return it to 
 her when it had ceased to be of use to me for the pur 
 pose intended. Accordingly, a day or two after, I in 
 closed it to her in a hasty note, as I was then leaving 
 London for Paris, and had not yet had time fully to 
 consider the subject. On reviewing my note I can re 
 call that then the whole history appeared to me like one 
 of those singular cases where unnatural impulses to 
 

<page 495>
450 THE BYRON CONTROVERSY. 
 
 vice are the result of a taint of constitutional insanity. 
 This has always seemed to me the only way of account 
 ing for instances of utterly motiveless and abnormal 
 wickedness and cruelty. These, my first impressions, 
 were expressed in the hasty note written at the time : 
 
 LONDON, November 5, 1856. 
 
 DEAREST FRIEND, I return these. They have held 
 mine eyes waking. How strange ! How unaccounta 
 ble ! Have you ever subjected the facts to the judg 
 ment of a medical man, learned in nervous pathology ? 
 Is it not insanity? 
 
 &quot; Great wits to madness nearly are allied, 
 And thin partitions do their bounds divide.&quot; 
 
 But my purpose to-night is not to write to you fully 
 what I think of this matter. I am going to write to 
 you from Paris more at leisure. 
 
 (The rest of the letter was taken up in the final 
 details of a charity in which Lady Byron had been 
 engaged with me in assisting an unfortunate artist. It 
 concludes thus :) 
 
 I write now in all haste, en route for Paris. As to 
 America, all is not lost yet. Farewell. I love you, my 
 dear friend, as never before, with an intense feeling that 
 I cannot easily express. God bless you. 
 
 H. B. S. 
 
 The next letter is as follows : 
 
 PARIS, December 17, 1856. 
 
 DEAR LADY BYRON, The Kansas Committee have 
 
 written me a letter desiring me to express to Miss 
 
 their gratitude for the five pounds she sent them. I 
 

<page 496>
LETTER TO LADY BYRON. 451 
 
 am not personally acquainted with her, and must return 
 these acknowledgments through you. 
 
 I wrote you a day or two since, inclosing the reply 
 of the Kansas Committee to you. 
 
 On that subject on which you spoke to me the last 
 time we were together, I have thought often and 
 deeply. I have changed my mind somewhat. Consid 
 ering the peculiar circumstances of the case, I could 
 wish that the sacred veil of silence, so bravely thrown 
 over the past, should never be withdrawn during the 
 time that you remain with us. I would say then, leave 
 all wijbh some discreet friends, who, after both have 
 passed from earth, shall say what was due to justice. 
 I am led to think this by seeing how low, how un 
 worthy, the judgments of this world are ; and I would 
 not that what I so much respect, love, and revere should 
 be placed within reach of its harpy claw, which pollutes 
 what it touches. The day will yet come which will 
 bring to light every hidden thing. &quot; There is nothing 
 covered that shall not be revealed, neither hid that 
 shall not be known ; &quot; and so justice will not fail. 
 
 Such, my dear friend, are my thoughts ; different 
 from what they were since first I heard that strange, 
 sad history. Meanwhile I love you forever, whether 
 we meet again on earth or not. 
 
 Affectionately yours, H. B. S. 
 
 Before her article appeared in print, Mrs. Stowe 
 addressed the following letter to Dr. Holmes in Bos 
 ton : 
 

<page 497>
452 THE BYRON CONTROVERSY. 
 
 HARTFORD, June 26, 1869. 
 
 DEAR DOCTOR, I am going to ask help of you, 
 and I feel that confidence in your friendship that leads 
 me to be glad that I have a friend like you to ask 
 advice of. In order that you may understand fully 
 what it is, I must go back some years and tell you 
 about it. 
 
 When I went to England the first time, I formed a 
 friendship with Lady Byron which led to a somewhat 
 interesting correspondence. When there the second 
 time, after the publication of &quot; Dred &quot; in 1856, Lady 
 Byron wrote to me that she wished to have some pri 
 vate confidential conversation with me, and invited me 
 to come spend a day with her at her country-seat near 
 London. I went, met her alone, and spent an after 
 noon with her. The object of the visit she then 
 explained to me. She was in such a state of health 
 that she considered she had very little time to live, and 
 was engaged in those duties and reviews which every 
 thoughtful person finds who is coming deliberately, and 
 with their eyes open, to the boundaries of this mortal 
 life. 
 
 Lady Byron, as you must perceive, has all her life 
 lived under a weight of slanders and false imputations 
 laid upon her by her husband. Her own side of the 
 story has been told only to that small circle of confi 
 dential friends who needed to know it in order to assist 
 her in meeting the exigencies which it imposed on her. 
 Of course it has thrown the sympathy mostly on his 
 side, since the world generally has more sympathy with 
 impulsive incorrectness than with strict justice. 
 
 At that time there was a cheap edition of Byron s 
 

<page 498>
LETTER TO DR. HOLMES. 453 
 
 works in contemplation, meant to bring them into cir 
 culation among the masses, and the pathos arising from 
 the story of his domestic misfortunes was one great 
 means relied on for giving it currency. 
 
 Under these circumstances some of Lady Byron s 
 friends had proposed the question to her whether she 
 had not a responsibility to society for the truth ; 
 whether she did right to allow these persons to gain 
 influence over the popular mind by a silent consent to 
 an utter falsehood. As her whole life had been passed 
 in the most heroic self-abnegation and self sacrifice, the 
 question was now proposed to her whether one more 
 act of self-denial was not required of her, namely, to 
 declare the truth, no matter at what expense to her 
 own feelings. 
 
 For this purpose she told me she wished to recount 
 the whole story to a person in whom she had confi 
 dence, a person of another country, and out of the 
 whole sphere of personal and local feelings which 
 might be supposed to influence those in the country 
 and station in life where the events really happened, - 
 in order that I might judge whether anything more was 
 required of her in relation to this history. 
 
 The interview had almost the solemnity of a death 
 bed confession, and Lady Byron told me the history 
 which I have embodied in an article to appear in the 
 &quot;Atlantic Monthly.&quot; I have been induced to pre 
 pare it by the run which the Guiccioli book is having, 
 which is from first to last an unsparing attack on 
 Lady Byron s memory by Lord Byron s mistress. 
 
 When you have read my article, I want, not your 
 advice as to whether the main facts shall be told, for on 
 

<page 499>
454 THE BYRON CONTROVERSY. 
 
 this point I am so resolved that I frankly say advice 
 would do me no good. But you might help me, with 
 your delicacy and insight, to make the manner of tell 
 ing more perfect, and I want to do it as wisely and 
 well as such story can be told. 
 
 My post-office address after July 1st will be West- 
 port Point, Bristol Co., Mass., care of Mrs. I. M. 
 Soule. The proof-sheets will be sent you by the pub 
 lisher. Very truly yours, 
 
 H. B. STOWE. 
 
 In reply to the storm of controversy aroused by the 
 publication of this article, Mrs. Stowe made a more 
 extended effort to justify the charges which she had 
 brought against Lord Byron, in a work published in 
 1869, &quot;Lady Byron Vindicated.&quot; Immediately after 
 the publication of this work, she mailed a copy to Dr. 
 Oliver Wendell Holmes, accompanied by the following 
 note : 
 
 BOSTON, May 19, 1869. 
 
 DEAR DOCTOR, . . . In writing this book, which I 
 now take the liberty of sending to you, I have been in 
 . . . a &quot; critical place.&quot; It has been a strange, weird sort 
 of experience, and I have had not a word to say to 
 anybody, though often thinking of you and wishing I 
 could have a little of your help and sympathy in get 
 ting out what I saw. I think of you very much, and 
 rejoice to see the hold your works get on England as 
 well as this country, and I would give more for your 
 opinion than that of most folks. How often I have 
 pondered your last letter to me, and sent it to many

 (friends) ! God bless you. Please accept for yourself 
 and your good wife, this copy. 
 
 From yours truly, H. B. STOWE. 
 
 Mrs. Stowe also published in 1870, through Sampson 
 Low & Son, of London, a volume for English readers, 
 &quot;The History of the Byron Controversy.&quot; These 
 additional volumes, however, do not seem to have satis 
 fied the public as a whole, and perhaps the expediency 
 of the publication of Mrs. Stowe s first article is doubt 
 ful, even to her most ardent admirers. The most that 
 can be hoped for, through the mention of the subject 
 in this biography, is the vindication of Mrs. Stowe s 
 purity of motive and nobility of intention in bringing 
 this painful matter into notice. 
 
 While she was being on all hands effectively, and evi 
 dently in some quarters with rare satisfaction, roundly 
 abused for the article, and her consequent responsibil 
 ity in bringing this unsavory discussion so prominently 
 before the public mind, she received the following let 
 ter from Dr. 0. W. Holmes : 
 
 BOSTON, September 25, 1869. 
 
 MY DEAR MRS. STOWE, I have been meaning to 
 write to you for some time, but in the midst of all the 
 wild and virulent talk about the article in the &quot; Atlan 
 tic,&quot; I felt as if there was little to say until the first 
 fury of the storm had blown over. 
 
 I think that we all perceive now that the battle is 
 not to be fought here, but in England. I have listened 
 to a good deal of talk, always taking your side in a 
 quiet way, backed very heartily on one occasion by one

456 THE BYRON CONTROVERSY. 
 
 of my most intellectual friends, reading all that came 
 in my way, and watching the course of opinion. And 
 first, it was to be expected that the Guiccioli fanciers 
 would resent any attack on Lord Byron, and would 
 highly relish the opportunity of abusing one who, like 
 yourself, had been identified with all those moral enter 
 prises which elevate the standard of humanity at large, 
 and of womanhood in particular. After this scum had 
 worked itself off, there must necessarily follow a con 
 troversy, none the less sharp and bitter, but not depend 
 ing essentially on abuse. The first point the recusants 
 got hold of was the error of the two years which con 
 trived to run the gauntlet of so many pairs of eyes. 
 Some of them were made happy by mouthing and 
 shaking this between their teeth, as a poodle tears 
 round with a glove. This did not last long. No sen 
 sible person could believe for a moment you were mis 
 taken in the essential character of a statement every 
 word of which would fall on the ear of a listening 
 friend like a drop of melted lead, and burn its scar deep 
 into the memory. That Lady Byron believed and told 
 you the story will not be questibned by any but fools 
 and malignants. Whether her belief was well founded 
 there may be positive evidence in existence to show 
 affirmatively. The fact that her statement is not per 
 emptorily contradicted by those most likely to be ac 
 quainted with the facts of the case, is the one result 
 so far which is forcing itself into unwilling recogni 
 tion. I have seen nothing, in the various hypotheses 
 brought forward, which did not to me involve a greater 
 improbability than the presumption of guilt. Take 
 that, for witness, that Byron accused himself, through a 
 

<page 502>
DR. HOLMES S LETTER. 457 
 
 spirit of perverse vanity, of crimes he had not com 
 mitted. How preposterous ! He would stain the name 
 of a sister, whom, on the supposition of his innocence, 
 he loved with angelic ardor as well as purity, by associ 
 ating it with such an infamous accusation. Suppose 
 there are some anomalies hard to explain in Lady 
 Byron s conduct. Could a young and guileless woman, 
 in the hands of such a man, be expected to act in any 
 given way, or would she not be likely to waver, to 
 doubt, to hope, to contradict herself, in the anomalous 
 position in which, without experience, she found her 
 self? 
 
 As to the intrinsic evidence contained in the poems, 
 I think it confirms rather than contradicts the hypoth 
 esis of guilt. I do not think that Butler s argument, 
 and all the other attempts at invalidation of the story, 
 avail much in the face of the acknowledged fact that it 
 was told to various competent and honest witnesses, and 
 remains without a satisfactory answer from those most 
 interested. 
 
 I know your firm self-reliance, and your courage to 
 proclaim the truth when any good end is to be served 
 by it. It is to be expected that public opinion will be 
 more or less divided as to the expediency of this revela 
 tion. . . . 
 
 Hoping that you have recovered from your indisposi 
 tion, I am Faithfully yours, 
 
 0. W. HOLMES. 
 
 While undergoing the most unsparing and pitiless 
 criticism and brutal insult, Mrs. Stowe received the 
 following sympathetic words from Mrs. Lewes (George 
 Eliot) : *

 THE PRIORY, 21 NORTH BANK, December 10, 1869. 
 
 MY DEAR FRIEND, . . . In the midst of your 
 trouble I was often thinking of you, for I feared that 
 you were undergoing a considerable trial from the harsh 
 and unfair judgments, partly the fruit of hostility glad 
 to find an opportunity for venting itself, and partly of 
 that unthinking cruelty which belongs to hasty anony 
 mous journalism. For my own part, I should have pre 
 ferred that the Byron question should never have been 
 brought before the public, because I think the discus 
 sion of such subjects is injurious socially. But with 
 regard to yourself, dear friend, I feel sure that, in act 
 ing on a different basis of impressions, you were im 
 pelled by pure, generous feeling. Do not think that I 
 would have written to you of this point to express a 
 judgment. I am anxious only to convey to you a sense 
 of my sympathy and confidence, such as a kiss and a 
 pressure of the hand could give if I were near you. 
 
 I trust that I shall hear a good account of Professor 
 Stowe s health, as well as your own, whenever you have 
 time to write me a word or two. I shall not be so un 
 reasonable as to expect a long letter, for the hours of 
 needful rest from writing become more and more pre 
 cious as the years go on, but some brief news of you 
 and yours will be especially welcome just now. Mr. 
 Lewes unites with me in high regards to your husband 
 and yourself, but in addition to that I have the sister 
 woman s privilege of saying that I am always 
 
 Your affectionate friend, M. H. LEWES.

 CHARACTERISTICS OF THESE Two WOMEN. MRS. STOWE S FINAL 
 ESTIMATE OF MODERN SPIRITUALISM. 
 
 IT is with a feeling of relief that we turn from one of 
 the most disagreeable experiences of Mrs. Stowe s life 
 to one of the most delightful, namely, the warm friend 
 ship of one of the most eminent women of this age, 
 George Eliot. 
 
 There seems to have been some deep affinity of feel 
 ing that drew them closely together in spite of diversity 
 of intellectual tastes. 
 
 George Eliot s attention was first personally attracted 
 to Mrs. Stowe in 1853, by means of a letter which the 
 latter had written to Mrs. Follen. Speaking of this 
 incident she (George Eliot) writes : &quot; Mrs. Follen 
 showed me a delightful letter which she has just had 
 from Mrs. Stowe, telling all about herself. She begins 
 

<page 505>
460 GEORGE ELIOT. 
 
 by saying, * I am a little bit of a woman, rather more 
 than forty, as withered and dry as a pinch of snuff ; 
 never very well worth looking at in my best days, and 
 now a decidedly used-up article. The whole letter is 
 most fascinating, and makes one love her.&quot; l 
 
 The correspondence between these two notable wo 
 men was begun by Mrs. Stowe, and called forth the 
 following extremely interesting letter from the distin 
 guished English novelist : 
 
 THE PRIORY, 21 NORTH BANK, May 8, 1869. 
 MY DEAR FRIEND, I value very highly the warrant 
 to call you friend which your letter has given me. It 
 lay awaiting me on our return the other night from a 
 nine weeks absence in Italy, and it made me almost 
 wish that you could have a momentary vision of the dis 
 couragement, nay, paralyzing despondency in which 
 many days of my writing life have been passed, in order 
 that you might fully understand the good I find in 
 such sympathy as yours, in such an assurance as you 
 give me that my work has been worth doing. But I 
 will not dwell on any mental sickness of mine. The 
 best joy your words give me is the sense of that sweet, 
 generous feeling in you which dictated them. I shah 1 
 always be the richer because you have in this way made 
 me know you better. I must tell you that my first 
 glimpse of you as a woman came through a letter of 
 yours, and charmed me very much. The letter was ad 
 dressed to Mrs. Follen, and one morning I called on 
 her in London (how many years ago !) ; she was kind 
 enough to read it to me, because it contained a little 
 
 1 George Eliot s Life, edited by J. W. Cross, vol. i. 
 

<page 506>
FRIENDLY WORDS. 461 
 
 history of your life, and a sketch of your domestic 
 circumstances. I remember thinking that it was very 
 kind of you to write that long letter, in reply to in 
 quiries of one who was personally unknown to you ; 
 and, looking back with my present experience, I think 
 it was kinder than it then appeared, for at that time 
 you must have been much oppressed with the immediate 
 results of your fame. I remember, too, that you wrote 
 of your husband as one who was richer in Hebrew and 
 Greek than in pounds or shiUings ; and as an ardent 
 scholar has always been a character of peculiar interest 
 to me, I have rarely had your image in my mind with 
 out the accompanying image (more or less erroneous) of 
 such a scholar by your side. I shall welcome the fruit 
 of his Goethe studies, whenever it comes. 
 
 I have good hopes that your fears are groundless as 
 to the obstacles your new book (&quot; Oldtown Folks &quot;) may 
 find here from its thorough American character. Most 
 readers who are likely to be really influenced by writing 
 above the common order will find that special aspect 
 an added reason for interest and study ; and I dare say 
 you have long seen, as I am beginning to see with new 
 clearness, that if a book which has any sort of exquis- 
 iteness happens also to be a popular, widely circulated 
 book, the power over the social mind for any good is, 
 after all, due to its reception by a few appreciative na 
 tures, and is the slow result of radiation from that nar 
 row circle. I mean that you can affect a few souls, and 
 that each of these in turn may affect a few more, but 
 that no exquisite book tells properly and directly on a 
 multitude, however largely it may be spread by type and 
 paper. Witness the things the multitude will say about

 it, if one is so unhappy as to be obliged to hear their 
 sayings. I do not write this cynically, but in pure sad 
 ness and pity. Both traveling abroad and staying at 
 home among our English sights and sports, one must 
 continually feel how slowly the centuries work toward 
 the moral good of men, and that thought lies very close 
 to what you say as to your wonder or conjecture con 
 cerning my religious point of view. I believe that 
 religion, too, has to be modified according to the domi 
 nant phases ; that a religion more perfect than any yet 
 prevalent must express less care of personal consolation, 
 and the more deeply awing sense of responsibility to 
 man springing from sympathy with that which of all 
 things is most certainly known to us, the difficulty 
 of the human lot. Letters are necessarily narrow and 
 fragmentary, and when one writes on wide subjects, are 
 likely to create more misunderstanding than illumina 
 tion. But I have little anxiety in writing to you, dear 
 friend and fellow-laborer ; for you have had longer 
 experience than I as a writer, and fuller experience as 
 a woman, since you have borne children and known a 
 mother s history from the beginning. I trust your 
 quick and long-taught mind as an interpreter little 
 liable to mistake me. 
 
 When you say, &quot; We live in an orange grove, and are 
 planting many more,&quot; and when I think you must have 
 abundant family love to cheer you, it seems to me that 
 you must have a paradise about you. But no list of 
 circumstances will make a paradise. Nevertheless, I 
 must believe that the joyous, tender humor of your 
 books clings about your more immediate life, and 
 makes some of that sunshine for yourself which you 
 

<page 508>
A PARADISE IN FLORIDA. 463 
 
 have given to us. I see the advertisement of &quot; Old- 
 town Folks/ and shall eagerly expect it. That and 
 every other new link between us will be reverentially 
 valued. With great devotion and regard, 
 
 Yours always, M. L. LEWES. 
 
 Mrs. Stowe writes from Mandarin to George Eliot : 
 
 MANDARIN, February 8, 1872. 
 
 DEAR FRIEND, It is two years nearly since I had 
 your last very kind letter, and I have never answered, 
 because two years of constant and severe work have 
 made it impossible to give a drop to anything beyond 
 the needs of the hour. Yet I have always thought of 
 you, loved you, trusted you all the same, and read 
 every little scrap from your writing that came to hand. 
 
 One thing brings you back to me. I am now in 
 Florida in my little hut in the orange orchard, with the 
 broad expanse of the blue St. John s in front, and the 
 waving of the live-oaks, with their long, gray mosses, 
 overhead, and the bright gold of oranges looking 
 through dusky leaves around. It is like Sorrento, so 
 like that I can quite dream of being there. And when 
 I get here I enter another life. The world recedes ; I 
 am out of it ; it ceases to influence ; its bustle and noise 
 die away in the far distance ; and here is no winter, an 
 open-air life, a quaint, rude, wild wilderness sort of 
 life, both rude and rich ; but when I am here I write 
 more letters to friends than ever I do elsewhere. The 
 mail comes only twice a week, and then is the event of 
 the day. My old rabbi and I here set up our tent, he 
 with German, and Greek, and Hebrew, devouring all 
 

<page 509>
464 GEORGE ELIOT. 
 
 sorts of black-letter books, and I spinning ideal webs 
 out of bits that he lets fall here and there. 
 
 I have long thought that I would write you again 
 when I got here, and so I do. I have sent North to 
 have them send me the &quot; Harper s Weekly/ in which 
 your new story is appearing, and have promised myself 
 leisurely to devour and absorb every word of it. 
 
 While I think of it I want to introduce to you a 
 friend of mine, a most noble man, Mr. Owen, for some 
 years our ambassador at Naples, now living a literary 
 and scholar life in America. His father was Robert 
 Dale Owen, the theorist and communist you may have 
 heard of in England some years since. 
 
 Years ago, in Naples, I visited Mr. Owen for the 
 first time, and found him directing his attention to the 
 phenomena of spiritism. He had stumbled upon some 
 singular instances of it accidentally, and he had forth 
 with instituted a series of researches and experiments 
 on the subject, some of which he showed me. It was 
 the first time I had ever seriously thought of the mat 
 ter, and he invited my sister and myself to see some of 
 the phenomena as exhibited by a medium friend of 
 theirs who resided in their family. The result at the 
 time was sufficiently curious, but I was interested in his 
 account of the manner in which he proceeded, keeping 
 records of every experiment with its results, in classified 
 orders. As the result of his studies and observations, 
 he has published two books, one &quot; Footfalls on the 
 Boundary of Another World,&quot; published in 1860, and 
 latterly, &quot; The Debatable Land Between this World and 
 the Next.&quot; I regard Mr. Owen as one of the few men 
 who are capable of entering into an inquiry of this 
 

<page 510>
ROBERT DALE OWEN. 465 
 
 kind without an utter drowning of common sense, and 
 his books are both of them worth a fair reading. To 
 me they present a great deal that is intensely curious and 
 interesting, although I do not admit, of course, all his 
 deductions, and think he often takes too much for 
 granted. Still, with every abatement there remains a 
 residuum of fact, which I think both curious and useful. 
 In a late letter to me he says : 
 
 &quot; There is no writer of the present day whom I 
 more esteem than Mrs. Lewes, nor any one whose opin 
 ion of my work I should more highly value.&quot; 
 
 I believe he intends sending them to you, and I hope 
 you will read them. Lest some of the narratives should 
 strike you, as such narratives did me once, as being a 
 perfect Arabian Nights Entertainment, I want to say 
 that I have accidentally been in the way of confirming 
 some of the most remarkable by personal observation. 
 ... In regard to all this class of subjects, I am of the 
 opinion of Goethe, that &quot; it is just as absurd to deny 
 the facts of spiritualism now as it was in the Middle 
 Ages to ascribe them to the Devil.&quot; I think Mr. 
 Owen attributes too much value to his facts. I do not 
 think the things contributed from the ultra-mundane 
 sphere are particularly valuable, apart from the evi 
 dence they give of continued existence after death. 
 
 I do not think there is yet any evidence to warrant 
 the idea that they are a supplement or continuation of 
 the revelations of Christianity, but I do regard them as 
 an interesting and curious study in psychology, and every 
 careful observer like Mr. Owen ought to be welcomed 
 to bring in his facts. With this I shall send you my 
 observations on Mr. Owen s books, from the &quot; Christian 
 

<page 511>
466 GEORGE ELIOT. 
 
 Union.&quot; I am perfectly aware of the frivolity and 
 worthlessness of much of the revealings purporting to 
 come from spirits. In my view, the worth or worth 
 lessness of them has nothing to do with the question of 
 fact. 
 
 Do invisible spirits speak in any wise, wise or fool 
 ish ? is the question a priori. I do not know of any 
 reason why there should not be as many foolish virgins 
 in the future state as in this. As I am a believer in 
 the Bible and Christianity, I don t need these things as 
 confirmations, and they are not likely to be a religion 
 io me. I regard them simply as I do the phenomena 
 of the Aurora Borealis, or Darwin s studies on natural 
 selection, as curious studies into nature. Besides, I 
 ihink some day we shall find a law by which all these 
 facts will fall into their places. 
 
 I hope now this subject does not bore you : it cer 
 tainly is one that seems increasingly to insist on getting 
 itself heard. It is going on and on, making converts, 
 who are many more than dare avow themselves, and 
 for my part I wish it were all brought into the daylight 
 of inquiry. 
 
 Let me hear from you if ever you feel like it. I know 
 vtoo well the possibilities and impossibilities of a nature 
 like yours to ask more, but it can do you no harm to 
 know that I still think of you and love you as ever. 
 Faithfully yours, H. B. STOWE. 
 
 THE PRIORY, 21 NORTH BANK, REGENT S PARK, March 4, 1872. 
 
 DEAR FRIEND, I can understand very easily that 
 
 the two last years have been full for you of other and 
 
 more imperative work than the writing of letters not 
 

<page 512>
AN OPEN MIND. 467 
 
 absolutely demanded either by charity or business. 
 The proof that you still think of me affectionately is 
 very welcome now it has come, and more cheering be 
 cause it enables me to think of you as enjoying your 
 retreat in your orange orchard, your western Sorrento 
 the beloved rabbi still beside you. I am sure it 
 must be a great blessing to you to bathe in that qui 
 etude, as it always is to us when we go out of reach of 
 London influences and have the large space of country 
 days to study, walk, and talk in. ... 
 
 When I am more at liberty I will certainly read Mr. 
 Owen s books, if he is good enough to send them to 
 me. I desire on all subjects to keep an open mind, but 
 hitherto the various phenomena, reported or attested in 
 connection with ideas of spirit intercourse and so on, 
 have come before me here in the painful form of the 
 lowest charlatanerie. . . . 
 
 But apart from personal contact with people who get 
 money by public exhibitions as mediums, or with semi- 
 idiots such as those who make a court for a Mrs. , 
 
 or other feminine personages of that kind, I would not 
 willingly place any barriers between my mind and anv 
 possible channel of truth affecting the human lot. The 
 spirit in which you have written in the paper you kindly 
 sent me is likely to touch others, and arouse them at 
 least to attention in a case where you have been deeply 
 impressed. . . . 
 
 Yours with sincere affection, 
 
 M. L. LEWES.

468 GEORGE ELIOT. 
 
 (Begun April 4th.) 
 
 MANDARIN, FLORIDA, May 11, 1872. 
 
 MY DEAR FRIEND, I was very glad to get your 
 dear little note, sorry to see by it that you are not in 
 your full physical force. Owing to the awkwardness 
 and misunderstanding of publishers, I am not reading 
 &quot; Middlemarch,&quot; as I expected to be, here in these 
 orange shades: they don t send it, and I am too far 
 out of the world to get it. I felt, when I read your 
 letters, how glad I should be to have you here in our 
 Florida cottage, in the wholly new, wild, woodland life. 
 Though resembling Italy in climate, it is wholly dif 
 ferent in the appearance of nature, the plants, the 
 birds, the animals, all different. The green tidiness 
 and culture of England here gives way to a wild and 
 rugged savageness of beauty. Every tree bursts forth 
 with flowers ; wild vines and creepers execute delirious 
 gambols, and weave and interweave in interminable 
 labyrinths. Yet here, in the great sandy plains back 
 of our house, there is a constant wondering sense of 
 beauty in the wild, wonderful growths of nature. First 
 of all, the pines high as the stone pines of Italy 
 with long leaves, eighteen inches long, through which 
 there is a constant dreamy sound, as if of dashing 
 waters. Then the live-oaks and the water-oaks, nar 
 row-leaved evergreens, which grow to enormous size, 
 and whose branches are draped with long festoons of 
 the gray moss. There is a great, wild park of these 
 trees back of us, which, with the dazzling, varnished 
 green of the new spring leaves and the swaying drapery 
 of moss, looks like a sort of enchanted grotto. Un 
 derneath grow up hollies and ornamental flowering 
 

<page 514>
THE LAND OF FLOWERS. 469 
 
 shrubs, and the yellow jessamine climbs into and over 
 everything with fragrant golden bells and buds, so that 
 sometimes the foliage of a tree is wholly hidden in its 
 embrace. 
 
 This wild, wonderful, bright and vivid growth, that 
 is ah 1 new, strange, and unknown by name to me, has 
 a charm for me. It is the place to forget the outside 
 world, and live in one s self. And if you were here, 
 we would go together and gather azaleas, and white 
 lilies, and silver bells, and blue iris. These flowers keep 
 me painting in a sort of madness. I have just finished 
 a picture of white lilies that grow in the moist land by 
 the watercourses. I am longing to begin on blue iris. 
 Artist, poet, as you are by nature, you ought to see all 
 these things, and if you would come here I would take 
 you in heart and house, and you should have a little 
 room in our cottage. The history of the cottage is this : 
 I found a hut built close to a great live-oak twenty- 
 five feet in girth, and with overarching boughs eighty 
 feet up in the air, spreading like a firmament, and all 
 swaying with mossy festoons. We began to live here, 
 and gradually we improved the hut by lath, plaster, and 
 paper. Then we threw out a wide veranda all round, 
 for in these regions the veranda is the living-room of 
 the house. Ours had to be built around the trunk of 
 the tree, so that our cottage has a peculiar and original 
 air, and seems as if it were half tree, or a something that 
 had grown out of the tree. We added on parts, and 
 have thrown out gables and chambers, as a tree throws 
 out new branches, till our cottage is like nobody else s, 
 and yet we settle into it with real enjoyment. There 
 are all sorts of queer little rooms in it, and we are 
 

<page 515>
470 GEORGE ELIOT. 
 
 accommodating at this present a family of seventeen 
 souls. In front, the beautiful, grand St. John s stretches 
 five miles from shore to shore, and we watch the steam 
 boats plying back and forth to the great world we are 
 out of. On all sides, large orange trees, with their 
 dense shade and ever-vivid green, shut out the sun so 
 that we can sit, and walk, and live in the open air. 
 Our winter here is only cool, bracing out-door weather, 
 without snow. No month without flowers blooming in 
 the open air, and lettuce and peas in the garden. The 
 summer range is about 90, but the sea-breezes keep 
 the air delightfully fresh. Generally we go North, 
 however, for three months of summer. Well, I did not 
 mean to run on about Florida, but the subject runs 
 away with me, and I want you to visit us in spirit if 
 not personally. 
 
 My poor rabbi ! he sends you some Arabic, which 
 I fear you cannot read : on diablerie he is up to his 
 ears in knowledge, having read all things in all tongues, 
 from the Talmud down. . . . 
 
 Ever lovingly yours, H. B. STOWE. 
 
 BOSTON, September 26, 1872. 
 
 MY DEAR FRIEND, I think when you see my name 
 again so soon, you will think it rains, hails, and snows 
 notes from this quarter. Just now, however, I am in 
 this lovely, little nest in Boston, where dear Mrs. Fields, 
 like a dove, &quot; sits brooding on the charmed wave.&quot; We 
 are both wishing we had you here with us, and she has 
 not received any answer from you as yet in reply to 
 the invitation you spoke of in your last letter to me. 
 It seems as if you must have written, and the letter 
 

<page 516>

<page 517>

<page 518>
DOROTHEA. 471 
 
 somehow gone astray, because I know, of course, you 
 would write. Yesterday we were both out of our senses 
 with mingled pity and indignation at that dreadful 
 stick of a Casaubon, and think of poor Dorothea 
 dashing like a warm, sunny wave against so cold and 
 repulsive a rock ! He is a little too dreadful for any 
 thing : there does not seem to be a drop of warm blood 
 in him, and so, as it is his misfortune and not his fault, 
 to be cold-blooded, one must not get angry with him. 
 It is the scene in the garden, after the interview with 
 the doctor, that rests on our mind at this present. 
 There was such a man as he over in Boston, high in 
 literary circles, but I fancy his wife was n t like Doro 
 thea, and a vastly proper time they had of it, treating 
 each other with mutual reverence, like two Chinese 
 mandarins. 
 
 My love, what I miss in this story is just what we 
 would have if you would come to our tumble-down, 
 jolly, improper, but joyous country, namely, &quot; jolli- 
 tude.&quot; You write and live on so high a plane ! It is 
 all self-abnegation. We want to get you over here, 
 and into this house, where, with closed doors, we some 
 times make the rafters ring with fun, and say anything 
 and everything, no matter what, and won t be any 
 properer than we s a mind to be. I am wishing every 
 day you could see our America, travel, as I have been 
 doing, from one bright, thriving, pretty, flowery town 
 to another, and see so much wealth, ease, progress, cul 
 ture, and all sorts of nice things. This dovecot where 
 I now am is the sweetest little nest imaginable ; front 
 ing on a city street, with back windows opening on a 
 sea view, with still, quiet rooms filled with books, pic- 
 

<page 519>
472 GEORGE ELIOT. 
 
 tures, and all sorts of things, such as you and Mr. Lewes 
 would enjoy. Don t be afraid of the ocean, now ! I ve 
 crossed it six times, and assure you it is an overrated 
 item. Froude is coming here why not you ? Be 
 sides, we have the fountain of eternal youth here, that 
 is, in Florida, where I live, and if you should come you 
 would both of you take a new lease of life, and what 
 glorious poems, and philosophies, and whatnot, we 
 should have ! My rabbi writes, in the seventh heaven, 
 an account of your note to him. To think of his set- 
 ting-off on his own account when I was away ! 
 
 Come now, since your answer to dear Mrs. Fields is 
 yet to come ; let it be a glad yes, and we will clasp you 
 to our heart of hearts. 
 
 Your ever loving, H. B. S. 
 
 During the summer of 1874. while Mrs. Stowe s 
 
 O f 
 
 brother, the Rev. Henry Ward Beecher, was the victim 
 of a most revolting, malicious, and groundless attack 
 on his purity, Mrs. Lewes wrote the following words of 
 sympathy : 
 
 MY DEAR FRIEND, The other day I had a letter 
 from Mrs. Fields, written to let me know something of 
 you under that heavy trouble, of which such informa 
 tion as I have had has been quite untrustworthy, leav 
 ing me in entire incredulity in regard to it except on 
 this point, that you and yours must be suffering deeply. 
 Naturally I thought most of you in the matter (its pub- 
 He aspects being indeterminate), and many times before 
 our friend s letter came I had said to Mr. Lewes : 
 &quot; What must Mrs. Stowe be feeling ! &quot; I remember 
 

<page 520>
CONSOLATION. 473 
 
 Mrs. Fields once told me of the .wonderful courage and 
 cheerfulness which belonged to you, enabling you to 
 bear up under exceptional trials, and I imagined you 
 helping the sufferers with tenderness and counsel, but 
 yet, nevertheless, I felt that there must be a bruising 
 weight on your heart. Dear, honored friend, you who 
 are so ready to give warm fellowship, is it any comfort 
 to you to be told that those afar off are caring for you 
 in spirit, and will be happier for all good issues that 
 may bring you rest ? 
 
 I cannot, dare not, write more in my ignorance, lest I 
 should be using unreasonable words. But I trust in 
 your not despising this scrap of paper which tells you, 
 perhaps rather for my relief than yours, that I am 
 always in grateful, sweet remembrance of your goodness 
 to me and your energetic labors for all. 
 
 It was two years or more before Mrs. Stowe replied 
 to these words of sympathy. 
 
 Orange-blossom time, MANDARIN, March 18, 1876. 
 
 MY DEAR FRIEND, I always think of you when 
 the orange trees are in blossom; just now they are 
 fuller than ever, and so many bees are filling the 
 branches that the air is full of a sort of still murmur. 
 And now I am beginning to hear from you every 
 month in Harper s. It is as good as a letter. &quot; Daniel 
 Deronda &quot; has succeeded in awaking in my somewhat 
 worn-out mind an interest. So many stories are tramp 
 ing over one s mind in every modern magazine nowa 
 days that one is macadamized, so to speak. It takes 
 something unusual to make a sensation. This does

 excite and interest me, as I wait for each number with 
 eagerness. I wish I could endow you with our long 
 winter weather, not winter, except such as you find 
 in Sicily. We live here from November to June, and 
 my husband sits outdoors on the veranda and reads 
 all day. We emigrate in solid family : my two dear 
 daughters, husband, self, and servants come together 
 to spend the winter here, and so together to our North 
 ern home in summer. My twin daughters relieve me 
 from all domestic care ; they are lively, vivacious, with a 
 real genius for practical life. We have around us a lit 
 tle settlement of neighbors, who like ourselves have a 
 winter home here, and live an easy, undress, picnic kind 
 of life, far from the world and its cares. Mr. Stowe 
 has been busy on eight volumes of Gorres on the mys 
 ticism of the Middle Ages. 1 This Gorres was Professor 
 of Philosophy at Munich, and he reviews the whole 
 ground of the shadow-land between the natural and 
 the supernatural, ecstacy, trance, prophecy, miracles, 
 spiritualism, the stigmata, etc. He was a devout Roman 
 Catholic, and the so-called facts that he reasons on 
 seem to me quite amazing ; and yet the possibilities that 
 lie between inert matter and man s living, all-powerful, 
 immortal soul may make almost anything credible. 
 The soul at times can do anything with matter. I 
 have been busying myself with Sainte-Beuve s seven 
 volumes on the Port Royal development. I like him 
 (Sainte-Beuve). His capacity of seeing, doing justice to 
 all kinds of natures and sentiments, is wonderful. I am 
 sorry he is no longer our side the veil.

PICNICKING ON THE SHORES OF LIFE. 475 
 
 the orange trees fronting my window, so sweetly and 
 insistently as to almost stop my writing. I hope, dear 
 friend, you are well better than when you wrote last. 
 
 It was very sweet and kind of you to write what you 
 did last. I suppose it is so long ago you may have for 
 gotten, but it was a word of tenderness and sympathy 
 about my brother s trial ; it was womanly, tender, and 
 sweet, such as at heart you are. After all, my love of 
 you is. greater than my admiration, for I think it more 
 and better to be really a woman worth loving than to 
 have read Greek and German and written books. And 
 in this last book I read, I feel more with you in some 
 little, fine points, they stare at me as making an 
 amusing exhibition. For, my dear, I feel myself at 
 last as one who has been playing and picnicking on the 
 shores of life, and waked from a dream late in the 
 afternoon to find that everybody almost has gone over 
 to the beyond. And the rest are sorting their things 
 and packing their trunks, and waiting for the boat to 
 come and take them. 
 
 It seems now but a little time since my brother 
 Henry and I were two young people together. He 
 was my two years junior, and nearest companion out of 
 seven brothers and three sisters. I taught him draw 
 ing and heard his Latin lessons, for you know a girl 
 becomes mature and womanly long before a boy. I 
 saw him through college, and helped him through the 
 difficult love affair that gave him his wife ; and then he 
 and my husband had a real German, enthusiastic love 
 for each other, which ended in making me a wife. 
 Ah ! in those days we never dreamed that he, or I, or 
 any of us, were to be known in the world. All he 
 

<page 523>
476 GEORGE ELIOT. 
 
 seemed then was a boy full of fun, full of love, full of 
 enthusiasm for protecting abused and righting wronged 
 people, which made him in those early days write ed 
 itorials, and wear arms and swear himself a special 
 policeman to protect the poor negroes in Cincinnati, 
 where we then lived, when there were mobs instigated 
 by the slaveholders of Kentucky. 
 
 Then he married, and lived a missionary life in the 
 new West, all with a joyousness, an enthusiasm, a chiv 
 alry, which made life bright and vigorous to us both. 
 Then in time he was called to Brooklyn, just as the 
 crisis of the great anti-slavery battle came on, and the 
 Fugitive Slave Law was passed. I was then in Maine, 
 and I well remember one snowy night his riding till 
 midnight to see me, and then our talking, till near 
 morning, what we could do to make headway against 
 the horrid cruelties that were being practiced against 
 the defenseless blacks. My husband was then away 
 lecturing, and my heart was burning itself out in in 
 dignation and anguish. Henry told me then that he 
 meant to fight that battle in New York ; that he would 
 have a church that would stand by him to resist the 
 tyrannic dictation of Southern slaveholders. I said : &quot; I, 
 too, have begun to do something ; I have begun a story, 
 trying to set forth the sufferings and wrongs of the 
 slaves.&quot; &quot; That s right, Hattie,&quot; he said ; &quot; finish it, 
 and I will scatter it thick as the leaves of Vallambrosa,&quot; 
 and so came &quot; Uncle Tom,&quot; and Plymouth Church be 
 came a stronghold where the slave always found refuge 
 and a strong helper. One morning my brother found 
 sitting on his doorstep poor old Paul Edmonson, weep 
 ing ; his two daughters, of sixteen and eighteen, had 
 

<page 524>

 passed into the slave warehouse of Bruin & Hill, and 
 were to be sold. My brother took the man by the 
 hand to a public meeting, told his story for him, and in 
 an hour raised the two thousand dollars to redeem his 
 children. Over and over again, afterwards, slaves were 
 redeemed at Plymouth Church, and Henry and Plym 
 outh Church became words of hatred and fear through 
 
 o 
 
 half the Union. From that time until we talked to 
 gether about the Fugitive Slave Law, there was not a 
 pause or stop in the battle till we had been through the 
 war and slavery had been wiped out in blood. Through 
 all he has been pouring himself out, wrestling, burning, 
 laboring everywhere, making stump speeches when 
 elections turned on the slave question, and ever main 
 taining that the cause of Christ was the cause of the 
 slave. And when all was over, it was he and Lloyd 
 Garrison who were sent by government once more to 
 raise our national flag on Fort Sumter. You must 
 see that a man does not so energize without making 
 many enemies. Half of our Union has been defeated, 
 a property of millions annihilated by emancipation, a 
 proud and powerful slave aristocracy reduced to beg 
 gary, and there are those who never saw our faces that, 
 to this hour, hate him and me. Then he has been a 
 progressive in theology. He has been a student of 
 Huxley, and Spencer, and Darwin, enough to alarm 
 the old school, and yet remained so ardent a supernat- 
 uralist as equally to repel the radical destructionists in 
 religion. He and I are Christ-worshippers, adoring 
 Him as the Image of the Invisible God and all that 
 comes from believing this. Then he has been a re 
 former, an advocate of universal suffrage and woman s 
 

<page 525>
478 GEORGE ELIOT. 
 
 rights, yet not radical enough to please that reform 
 party who stand where the Socialists of France do, and 
 are for tearing up all creation generally. Lastly, 
 he has had the misfortune of a popularity which is per 
 fectly phenomenal. I cannot give you any idea of the 
 love, worship, idolatry, with which he has been over 
 whelmed. He has something magnetic about him that 
 makes everybody crave his society, that makes men 
 follow and worship him. I remember being at his 
 house one evening in the time of early flowers, and in 
 that one evening came a box of flowers from Maine, 
 another from New Jersey, another from Connecticut, 
 all from people with whom he had no personal acquaint 
 ance, who had read something of his and wanted to 
 send him some token. I said, &quot; One would think you 
 were a prima donna. What does make people go on so 
 about you ? &quot; 
 
 My brother is hopelessly generous and confiding. 
 His inability to believe evil is something incredible, 
 and so has come all this suffering. You said you 
 hoped I should be at rest when the first investigating 
 committee and Plymouth Church cleared my brother 
 almost by acclamation. Not so. The enemy have so 
 committed themselves that either they or he must die, 
 and there has followed two years of the most dreadful 
 struggle. First, a legal trial of six months, the ex 
 penses of which on his side were one hundred and 
 eighteen thousand dollars, and in which he and his 
 brave wife sat side by side in the court-room, and heard 
 all that these plotters, who had been weaving their webs 
 for three years, could bring. The foreman of the jury 
 was offered a bribe of ten thousand dollars to decide 
 

<page 526>
THE TRIAL. 479 
 
 against my brother. He sent the letter containing the 
 proposition to the judge. But with all their plotting, 
 three fourths of the jury decided against them, and 
 their case was lost. It was accepted as a triumph by 
 my brother s friends ; a large number of the most in 
 fluential clergy of all denominations so expressed them 
 selves in a public letter, and it was hoped the thing 
 was so far over that it might be lived down and over 
 grown with better things. 
 
 But the enemy, intriguing secretly with all those par 
 ties in the community who wish to put down a public 
 and too successful man, have been struggling to 
 bring the thing up again for an ecclesiastical trial. The 
 cry has been raised in various religious papers that 
 Plymouth Church was in complicity with crime, that 
 they were so captivated with eloquence and genius 
 that they refused to make competent investigation. 
 The six months legal investigation was insufficient ; a 
 new trial was needed. Plymouth Church immediately 
 called a council of ministers and laymen, in number 
 representing thirty - seven thousand Congregational 
 Christians, to whom Plymouth Church surrendered her 
 records, her conduct, all the facts of the case, and 
 this great council unanimously supported the church 
 and ratified her decision ; recognizing the fact that, in 
 all the investigations hitherto, nothing had been proved 
 against my brother. They at his request, and that of 
 Plymouth Church, appointed a committee of five to 
 whom within sixty days any one should bring any facts 
 that they could prove, or else forever after hold their 
 peace. It is thought now by my brother s friends that 
 this thing must finally reach a close. But you see why 
 

<page 527>
480 GEORGE ELIOT. 
 
 I have not written. This has drawn on my life my 
 heart s blood. He is myself ; I know you are the 
 kind of woman to understand me when I say that I 
 felt a blow at him more than at myself. I, who know 
 his purity, honor, delicacy, know that he has been 
 from childhood of an ideal purity, who reverenced 
 his conscience as his king, whose glory was redressing 
 human wrong, who spake no slander, no, nor listened 
 to it. 
 
 Never have I known a nature of such strength, and 
 such almost childlike innocence. He is of a nature so 
 sweet and perfect that, though I have seen him thun 
 derously indignant at moments, I never saw him fretful 
 or irritable, a man who continuously, in every little 
 act of life, is thinking of others, a man that all the chil 
 dren on the street run after, and that every sorrowful, 
 weak, or distressed person looks to as a natural helper. 
 In all this long history there has been no circumstance 
 of his relation to any woman that has not been worthy 
 of himself, pure, delicate, and proper ; and I know all 
 sides of it, and certainly should not say this if there 
 were even a misgiving. Thank God, there is none, and 
 I can read my New Testament and feel that by all the 
 beatitudes my brother is blessed. 
 
 His calmness, serenity, and cheerfulness through all 
 this time has uplifted us all. Where he was, there was 
 no anxiety, no sorrow. My brother s power to console 
 is something peculiar and wonderful. I have seen him 
 at death-beds and funerals, where it would seem as if 
 hope herself must be dumb, bring down the very peace 
 of Heaven and change despair to trust. He has not 
 had less power in his own adversity. You cannot con- 
 

<page 528>
A RARE NATURE. 481 
 
 ceive how he is beloved, by those even who never saw 
 him, old, paralytic, distressed, neglected people, poor 
 seamstresses, black people, who have felt these arrows 
 shot against their benefactor as against themselves, and 
 most touching have been their letters of sympathy. 
 From the first, he has met this in the spirit of Francis 
 de Sales, who met a similar plot, by silence, prayer, 
 and work, and when urged to defend himself said &quot; God 
 would do it in his time.&quot; God was the best judge how 
 much reputation he needed to serve Him with. 
 
 In your portrait of Deronda, you speak of him as 
 one of those rare natures in whom a private wrong 
 bred no bitterness. &quot; The sense of injury breeds, not the 
 will to inflict injuries, but a hatred of all injury ; &quot; and 
 I must say, through all this conflict my brother has been 
 always in the spirit of Him who touched and healed 
 the ear of Malchus when he himself was attacked. 
 His friends and lawyers have sometimes been aroused 
 and sometimes indignant with his habitual caring for 
 others, and his habit of vindicating and extending even 
 to his enemies every scrap and shred of justice that 
 might belong to them. From first to last of this trial, 
 he has never for a day intermitted his regular work. 
 Preaching to crowded houses, preaching even in his 
 short vacations at watering places, carrying on his mis 
 sions which have regenerated two once wretched dis 
 tricts of the city, editing a paper, and in short giving 
 himself up to work. He cautioned his church not to 
 become absorbed in him and his trials, to prove their 
 devotion by more faithful church work and a wider 
 charity ; and never have the Plymouth missions among 
 the poor been so energetic and effective. He said 
 

<page 529>
482 GEORGE ELIOT. 
 
 recently, &quot; The worst that can befall a man is to stop 
 thinking of God and begin to think of himself ; if 
 trials make us self-absorbed, they hurt us.&quot; Well, dear, 
 pardon me for this outpour. I loved you I love you 
 and therefore wanted you to know just what I felt. 
 Now, dear, this is over, don t think you must reply to it 
 or me. I know how much you have to do, yes, I 
 know all about an aching head and an overtaxed brain. 
 This last work of yours is to be your best, I think, and 
 I hope it will bring you enough to buy an orange grove 
 in Sicily, or somewhere else, and so have lovely weather 
 such as we have. 
 
 Your ancient admirer, 1 who usually goes to bed at 
 eight o clock, was convicted by me of sitting up after 
 eleven over the last installment of &quot; Daniel Deronda,&quot; and 
 he is full of it. We think well of Guendoline, and that 
 she is n t much more than young ladies in general so far. 
 
 Next year, if I can possibly do it, I will send you 
 some of our oranges. I perfectly long to have you 
 &amp;lt;enjoy them. 
 
 Your very loving H. B. STOWE. 
 
 P. S. I am afraid I shall write you again when I am 
 reading your writings, they are so provokingly sugges 
 tive of things one wants to say. H. B. S. 
 
 In her reply to this letter Mrs. Lewes says, inciden

GEORGE ELIOTS LAST LETTER. 483 
 
 After Mr. Lewes s death, Mrs. Lewes writes to Mrs. 
 
 Stowe : 
 
 THE PRIORY, 21 NORTH BANK, April 10, 1879. 
 
 MY DEAR FRIEND, I have been long without send 
 ing you any sign (unless you have received a message 
 from me through Mrs. Fields), but my heart has been 
 going out to you and your husband continually as 
 among the chief of the many kind beings who have 
 given me their tender fellow-feeling in my last earthly 
 sorrow. . . . When your first letter came, with the beauti 
 ful gift of your book, 1 I was unable to read any letters, 
 and did not for a long time see what you had sent me. 
 But when I did know, and had read your words of 
 thankfulness at the great good you have seen wrought 
 by your help, I felt glad, for your sake first, and then 
 for the sake of the great nation to which you belong. 
 The hopes of the world are taking refuge westward, 
 under the calamitous conditions, moral and physical, in 
 which we of the elder world are getting involved. . . . 
 
 Thank you for telling me that you have the comfort 
 of seeing your son in a path that satisfies your best 
 wishes for him. I like to think of your having family 
 joys. One of the prettiest photographs of a child that 
 I possess is one of your sending to me. . . . 
 
 Please offer my reverential, affectionate regards to 
 your husband, and believe me, dear friend, 
 Yours always gratefully, 
 
 M. L. LEWES. 
 
 As much as has been said with regard to spiritualism 
 in these pages, the subject has by no means the promi-

<page 531>
484 GEORGE ELIOT. 
 
 nence that it really possessed in the studies and conver 
 sations of both Professor and Mrs. Stowe. 
 
 Professor Stowe s very remarkable psychological de 
 velopment, and the exceptional experiences of his early 
 life, were sources of conversation of unfailing interest 
 and study to both. 
 
 Professor Stowe had made an elaborate and valuable 
 collection of the literature of the subject, and was, as 
 Mrs. Stowe writes, &quot; over head and ears in diablerie. 9 
 
 It is only just to give Mrs. Stowe s views on this per 
 plexing theme more at length, and as the mature re 
 flection of many years has caused them to take form. 
 
 In reference to professional mediums, and spirits that 
 peep, rap, and mutter, she writes : 
 
 &quot; Each friend takes away a portion of ourselves. 
 There was some part of our being related to him as 
 to no other, and we had things to say to him which no 
 other would understand or appreciate. A portion of 
 our thoughts has become useless and burdensome, and 
 again and again, with involuntary yearning, we turn to 
 the stone at the door of the sepulchre. We lean 
 against the cold, silent marble, but there is no answer, 
 no voice, neither any that regardeth. 
 
 &quot; There are those who would have us think that in 
 our day this doom is reversed ; that there are those who 
 have the power to restore to us the communion of our 
 lost ones. How many a heart, wrung and tortured with 
 the anguish of this fearful silence, has throbbed with 
 strange, vague hopes at the suggestion ! When we 
 hear sometimes of persons of the strongest and clearest 
 minds becoming credulous votaries of certain spiritual 
 ist circles, let us not wonder : if we inquire, we shall 
 

<page 532>
MATURE VIEWS ON SPIRITUALISM. 485 
 
 almost always find that the belief has followed some 
 stroke of death ; it is only an indication of the desper 
 ation of that heart-hunger which in part it appeases. 
 
 &quot; Ah, were it true ! Were it indeed so that the wall 
 between the spiritual and material is growing thin, and 
 a new dispensation germinating in which communion 
 with the departed blest shall be among the privileges 
 and possibilities of this our mortal state ! Ah, were it 
 so that when we go forth weeping in the gray dawn, 
 bearing spices and odors which we long to pour forth 
 for the beloved dead, we should indeed find the stone 
 rolled away and an angel sitting on it ! 
 
 &quot; But for us the stone must be rolled away by an un 
 questionable angel, whose countenance is as the light 
 ning, who executes no doubtful juggle by pale moon 
 light or starlight, but rolls back the stone in fair, open 
 morning, and sits on it. Then we could bless God for 
 his mighty gift, and with love, and awe, and reverence 
 take up that blessed fellowship with another life, and 
 weave it reverently and trustingly into the web of our 
 daily course. 
 
 &quot; But no such angel have we seen, no such sublime, 
 unquestionable, glorious manifestation. And when we 
 look at what is offered to us, ah ! who that had a friend 
 in heaven could wish them to return in such wise as 
 this ? The very instinct of a sacred sorrow seems to 
 forbid that our beautiful, our glorified ones should 
 stoop lower than even to the medium of their cast-off 
 bodies, to juggle, and rap, and squeak, and perform 
 mountebank tricks with tables and chairs ; to recite over 
 in weary sameness harmless truisms, which we were 
 wise enough to say for ourselves ; to trifle, and banter, 
 

<page 533>
486 GEORGE ELIOT. 
 
 and jest, or to lead us through endless moonshiny mazes. 
 Sadly and soberly we say that, if this be communion 
 with the dead, we had rather be without it. We want 
 something a little in advance of our present life, and 
 not below it. We have read with some attention weary 
 pages of spiritual communication purporting to come 
 from Bacon, Swedenborg, and others, and long ac 
 counts from divers spirits of things seen in the spirit 
 land, and we can conceive of no more appalling pros 
 pect than to have them true^y 
 
 &quot; If the future life is so weary, stale, flat, and unprofit 
 able as we might infer from these readings, one would 
 have reason to deplore an immortality from which no 
 suicide could give an outlet. To be condemned to such 
 eternal prosing would be worse than annihilation. 
 
 &quot; Is there, then, no satisfaction for this craving of the 
 soul ? There is One who says : &quot; I am he that liveth 
 and was dead, and behold I am alive for evermore, and 
 I have the keys of hell and of death ; &quot; and this same 
 being said once before : &quot; He that loveth me shall be 
 loved of my Father, and I will love him and will mani 
 fest myself unto him.&quot; This is a promise direct and 
 personal ; not confined to the first apostles, but stated 
 in the most general way as attainable by any one who 
 loves and does the will of Jesus. It seems given to us 
 as some comfort for the unavoidable heart-breaking 
 separations of death that there should be, in that dread 
 unknown, one all-powerful Friend with whom it is possi 
 ble to commune, and from whose spirit there may come a 
 response to us. Our Elder Brother, the partaker of our 
 nature, is not only in the spirit land, but is all-powerful 
 there. It is he that shutteth and no man openeth, and 
 

<page 534>
CHRISTIAN SPIRITUALISM. 487 
 
 openeth and no man shutteth. He whom we have seen 
 in the flesh, weeping over the grave of Lazarus, is he 
 who hath the keys of hell and of death. If we cannot 
 commune with our friends, we can at least commune 
 with Him to whom they are present, who is intimately 
 with them as with us. He is the true bond of union 
 between the spirit world and our souls ; and one blest 
 hour of prayer, when we draw near to Him and feel the 
 breadth, and length, and depth, and heighth of that love 
 of his that passeth knowledge, is better than all those 
 incoherent, vain, dreamy glimpses with which longing 
 hearts are cheated. 
 
 &quot; They who have disbelieved all spiritual truth, who 
 have been Sadduceeic doubters of either angel or spirit, 
 may find in modern spiritualism a great advance. But 
 can one who has ever really had communion with Christ, 
 who has said with John, &quot; Truly our fellowship is with 
 the Father and the Son,&quot; can such an one be satisfied 
 with what is found in the modern circle ? 
 
 &quot; For Christians who have strayed into these inclos- 
 ures, we cannot but recommend the homely but apt 
 quotation of old John Newton : 
 
 &quot; What think ye of Christ is the test 
 
 To try both your word and your scheme. 
 
 f &quot; In all these so-called revelations, have there come any 
 echoes of the new song which no man save the redeemed 
 from earth could learn ; any unf oldings of that love 
 that passeth knowledge, anything, in short, such as 
 spirits might utter to whom was unveiled that which 
 eye hath not seen nor ear heard, neither hath entered 
 the heart of man to conceive ? We must confess that 
 

<page 535>
488 GEORGE ELIOT. 
 
 all those spirits that yet have spoken appear to be liv 
 ing in quite another sphere from John or Paul. 
 
 &quot; Let us, then, who long for communion with spirits, 
 seek nearness to Him who has promised to speak and 
 commune, leaving forever this word to his church : 
 
 &quot; I will not leave you comfortless. I will come to 
 you. &quot;

 BESIDES the annual journeys to and from Florida, 
 and her many interests in the South, Mrs. Stowe s time 
 between 1870 and 1880 was largely occupied by lit 
 erary and kindred labors. In the autumn of 1871 we 
 find her writing to her daughters as follows regarding 
 her work : 
 
 &quot; I have at last finished all my part in the third book 
 of mine that is to come out this year, to wit Oldtown 
 Fireside Stories/ and you can have no idea what a per 
 fect luxury of rest it is to be free from all literary 
 engagements, of all kinds, sorts, or descriptions. I feel 
 like a poor woman I once read about, 
 
 &quot; Who always was tired, 
 Cause she lived in a bouse 
 Where help was n t hired/ 
 
 and of whom it is related that in her dying moments, 
 
 &quot; She folded her hands 
 With her latest endeavor, 
 Saying nothing, dear nothing, 
 Sweet nothing forever.

 &quot; I am in about her state of mind. I luxuriate in 
 laziness. I do not want to do anything or go any 
 where. I only want to sink down into lazy enjoyment 
 of living.&quot; 
 
 She was certainly well entitled to a rest, for never 
 had there been a more laborious literary life. In addi 
 tion to the twenty-three books already written, she had 
 prepared for various magazines and journals an incred 
 ible number of short stories, letters of travel, essays, 
 and other articles. Yet with all she had accomplished, 
 and tired as she was, she still had seven books to write, 
 besides many more short stories, before her work should 
 be done. As her literary life did not really begin until 
 1852, the bulk of her work has been accomplished 
 within twenty-six years, as will be seen from the fol 
 lowing list of her books, arranged in the chronological 
 order of their publication : 
 
 1833. An Elementary Geography. 
 1843. The Mayflower.

 In 1872 a new and remunerative field of labor was 
 opened to Mrs. Stowe, and though it entailed a vast 
 amount of weariness and hard work, she entered it 
 with her customary energy and enthusiasm. It pre 
 sented itself in the shape of an offer from the American 
 Literary (Lecture) Bureau of Boston to deliver a course 
 of forty readings from her own works in the principal 
 cities of the New England States. The offer was a 
 liberal one, and Mrs. Stowe accepted it on condition 
 that the reading tour should be ended in time to allow 
 her to go to her Florida home in December. This be 
 ing acceded to, she set forth and gave her first reading 
 in Bridgeport, Conn., on the evening of September 19, 
 1872. 
 
 The following extracts from letters written to her 
 husband while on this reading tour throw some inter 
 esting gleams of light on the scenes behind the curtain 
 of the lecturer s platform. From Boston, October 3d, 
 she writes : &quot; Have had a most successful but fatiguing 
 week. Read in Cambridgeport to-night, and Newbury- 
 port to-morrow night.&quot; Two weeks later, upon receipt 
 of a letter from her husband, in which he fears he has 
 not long to live, she writes from Westfield, Mass : 
 

<page 539>
492 CLOSING SCENES. 
 
 &quot; I have never had a greater trial than being forced 
 to stay away from you now. I would not, but that my 
 engagements have involved others in heavy expense, 
 and should I fail to fulfill them, it would be doing a 
 wrong. 
 
 &quot; God has given me strength as I needed it, and I 
 never read more to my own satisfaction than last night. 
 
 &quot; Now, my dear husband, please do want, and try, 
 to remain with us yet a while longer, and let us have a 
 little quiet evening together before either of us crosses 
 the river. My heart cries out for a home with you ; 
 our home together in Florida. Oh, may we see it 
 again ! Your ever loving wife.&quot; 
 
 From Fitchburg, Mass., under date of October 29th, 
 she writes : 
 
 &quot; In the cars, near Palmer, who should I discover 
 but Mr. and Mrs. J. T. Fields, returning from a West 
 ern trip, as gay as a troubadour. I took an empty 
 seat next to them, and we had a jolly ride to Boston. 
 I drove to Mr. Williams s house, where I met the Chelsea 
 agent, who informed me that there was no hotel in 
 Chelsea, but that they were expecting to send over for 
 me. So I turned at once toward 148 Charles Street, 
 where I tumbled in on the Fields before they had got 
 their things off. We had a good laugh, and I received 
 a hearty welcome. I was quickly installed in my room, 
 where, after a nice dinner, I curled up for my after 
 noon nap. At half -past seven the carriage came for 
 me, and I was informed that I should not have a hard 
 reading, as they had engaged singers to take part. So, 
 when I got into the carriage, who should I find, be- 
 shawled, and beflowered, and betoggled in blue satin

 and white lace, but our old friend of Andover 
 
 concert memory, now become Madame Thingumbob, of 
 European celebrity. She had studied in Italy, come 
 out in Milan, sung there in opera for a whole winter, 
 and also in Paris and London. 
 
 &quot; &quot;Well, she sings very sweetly and looks very nice 
 and pretty. Then we had a little rosebud of a Chelsea 
 girl who sang, and a pianist. I read ( Minister s House 
 keeper and Topsy, and the audience was very jolly 
 and appreciative. Then we all jogged home.&quot; 
 
 The next letter finds Mrs. Stowe in Maine, and writ 
 ing in the cars between Bangor and Portland. She 
 says : 
 
 MY DEAR HUSBAND, Well, Portland and Bangor 
 are over, and the latter, which I had dreaded as lone 
 some and far off, turned out the pleasantest of any place 
 I have visited yet. I stayed at the Fays ; he was one 
 of the Andover students, you remember ; and found a 
 warm, cosy, social home. In the evening I met an 
 appreciative audience, and had a delightful reading. 
 I read Captain Kittridge, apparently to the great satis 
 faction of the people, who laughed heartily at his sea 
 stories, and the &quot; Minister s Housekeeper &quot; with the 
 usual success, also Eva and Topsy. 
 
 One woman, totally deaf, came to me afterwards and 
 said : &quot; Bless you. I come jist to see you. I d rather 
 see you than the Queen.&quot; Another introduced her lit 
 tle girl named Harriet Beecher Stowe, and another, 
 older, named Eva. She said they had traveled fifty 
 miles to hear me read. An incident like that appeals 
 to one s heart, does it not ? 
 

<page 541>
494 CLOSING SCENES. 
 
 The people of Bangor we^-e greatly embarrassed by 
 the horse disease ; but the mayor and his wife walked 
 over from their house, a long distance off, to bring me 
 flowers, and at the reading he introduced me. I had an 
 excellent audience notwithstanding that it rained tre 
 mendously, and everybody had to walk because 9 there 
 were no horses. The professors called on me, also 
 Newman Smith, now a settled minister here. 
 
 Everybody is so anxious about you, and Mr. Fay 
 made me promise that you and I should come and 
 spend a week with them next summer. Mr. Howard, 
 in Portland, called upon me to inquire for you, and 
 everybody was so delighted to hear that you were get 
 ting better. 
 
 It stormed all the time I was in Portland and Ban 
 gor, so I saw nothing of them. Now I am in a palace 
 car riding alongside the Kennebec, and recalling the 
 incidents of my trip. I certainly had very satisfactory 
 houses ; and these pleasant little visits, and meetings 
 with old acquaintance, would be well worth having, 
 even though I had made nothing in a pecuniary sense. 
 On the whole it is as easy a way of making money as 
 I have ever tried, though no way of making money is 
 perfectly easy, there must be some disagreeables. 
 The lonesomeness of being at a hotel in dull weather is 
 one, and in Portland it seems there is nobody now to 
 invite us to their homes. Our old friends there are 
 among the past. They have gone on over the river. 
 I send you a bit of poetry that pleases me. The love 
 of the old for each other has its poetry. It is some 
 thing sacred and full of riches. I long to be with you, 
 and to have some more of our good long talks.

 The scenery along this river is very fine. The oaks 
 still keep their leaves, though the other trees are bare ; 
 but oaks and pines make a pleasant contrast. We 
 shall stop twenty minutes at Brunswick, so I shall get 
 a glimpse of the old place. 
 
 Now we are passing through Hallowell, and the 
 Kennebec changes sides. What a beautiful river ! It 
 is now full of logs and rafts. Well, I must bring this 
 to a close. Good-by, dear, with unchanging love. Ever 
 your wife. 
 
 From South Framingham, Mass., she writes on No 
 vember 7th : 
 
 Well, my dear, here I am in E. s pretty little house. 
 He has a pretty wife, a pretty sister, a pretty baby, two 
 nice little boys, and a lovely white cat. The last is a 
 perfect beauty ! a Persian, from a stock brought over 
 by Dr. Parker, as white as snow, with the softest fur, a 
 perfect bunch of loving-kindness, all purr and felicity. 
 I had a good audience last evening, and enjoyed it. 
 My audiences, considering the horse disease and the 
 rains, are amazing. And how they do laugh ! We get 
 into regular gales. 
 
 E. has the real country minister turn-out : horse and 
 buggy, and such a nice horse too. The baby is a 
 beauty, and giggles, and goos, and shouts inquiries 
 with the rising inflection, in the most inspiring manner. 
 
 November 13. Wakefield. I read in Haverhill 
 last night. It was as usual stormy. I had a good 
 audience, but not springy and inspiriting like that at 
 Waltham. Some audiences seem to put spring into

 one, and some to take it out. This one seemed good 
 but heavy. I had to lift them, while in Framingham 
 and Waltham they lifted me. 
 
 The Lord bless and keep you. It grieves me to think 
 you are dull and I not with you. By and by we will 
 be together and stay together. Good-by dear. Your 
 ever loving wife, H. B. S. 
 
 November 24. &quot;I had a very pleasant reading in 
 Peabody. While there visited the library and saw the 
 picture of the Queen that she had painted expressly 
 for George Peabody. It was about six inches square, 
 enameled on gold, and set in a massive frame of solid 
 gold and velvet. The effect is like painting on ivory. 
 At night the picture rolls back into a safe, and great 
 doors, closed with a combination lock, defend it. It 
 reminded me of some of the foreign wonders we have 
 seen. 
 
 &quot; Well, my course is almost done, and if I get 
 through without any sickness, cold, or accident, how 
 wonderful it will seem. I have never felt the near, 
 kind presence of our Heavenly Father so much as in 
 this. ( He giveth strength to the faint, and to them of 
 no might He increaseth strength. I have found this 
 true all my life.&quot; 
 
 From Newport she writes on November 26th : 
 
 &quot; It was a hard, tiring, disagreeable piece of business 
 to read in New London. Had to wait three mortal 
 hours in Palmer. Then a slow, weary train, that did 
 not reach New London until after dark. There was 
 then no time to rest, and I was so tired that it did seem 
 as though I could not dress. I really trembled with 
 

<page 544>
LAST VISIT TO THE WEST. 497 
 
 fatigue. The hall was long and dimly lighted, and 
 the people were not seated compactly, but around in 
 patches. The light was dim, except for a great flaring 
 gas jet arranged right under my eyes on the reading 
 desk, and I did not see a creature whom I knew. I 
 was only too glad when it was over and I was back 
 again at my hotel. There I found that I must be up 
 at five o clock to catch the Newport train. 
 
 &quot;I started for this place in the dusk of a dreary, 
 foggy morning. Traveled first on a ferry, then in 
 cars, and then in a little cold steamboat. Found no 
 one to meet me, in spite of all my writing, and so took 
 a carriage and came to the hotel. The landlord was 
 very polite to me, said he knew me by my trunk, had 
 been to our place in Mandarin, etc. All I wanted was 
 a warm room, a good bed, and unlimited time to sleep. 
 Now I have had a three hours nap, and here I am, sit 
 ting by myself in the great, lonely hotel parlor. 
 
 &quot; Well, dear old man, I think lots of you, and only 
 want to end all this in a quiet home where we can sing 
 John Anderson, my Jo together. I check off place 
 after place as the captive the days of his imprison 
 ment. Only two more after to-night. Ever your lov 
 ing wife.&quot; 
 
 Mrs. Stowe made one more reading tour the follow 
 ing year, and this time it was in the West. On Octo 
 ber 28, 1873, she writes from Zanesville, Ohio, to her 
 son at Harvard : 
 
 You have been very good to write as often as you 
 have, and your letters, meeting me at different points, 
 have been most cheering. I have been tired, almost

498 CLOSING SCENES. 
 
 to the last degree. Read two successive evenings in 
 Chicago, and traveled the following day for thirteen 
 hours, a distance of about three hundred miles, to Cin 
 cinnati. We were compelled to go in the most uncom 
 fortable cars I ever saw, crowded to overflowing, a 
 fiend of a stove at each end burning up all the air, and 
 without a chance to even lay my head down. This is 
 the grand route between Chicago and Cincinnati, and 
 we were on it from eight in the morning until nearly 
 ten at night. 
 
 Arrived at Cincinnati we found that George Beecher 
 had not received our telegram, was not expecting us, 
 had no rooms engaged for us, and that we could not 
 get rooms at his boarding-place. After finding all this 
 out we had to go to the hotel, where, about eleven 
 o clock, I crept into bed with every nerve aching from 
 fatigue. The next day was dark and rainy, and I lay 
 in bed most of it ; but when I got up to go and read 
 I felt only half rested, and was still so tired that it 
 seemed as though I could not get through. 
 
 Those who planned my engagements failed to take 
 into account the fearful distances and wretched trains 
 out here. On none of these great Western routes is 
 there a drawing-room car. Mr. Saunders tried in every 
 way to get them to put one on for us, but in vain. 
 They are all reserved for the night trains ; so that there 
 is no choice except to travel by night in sleeping cars, 
 or take such trains as I have described in the daytime. 
 
 I had a most sympathetic audience in Cincinnati ; 
 they all seemed delighted and begged me to come 
 again. The next day George took us for a drive out 
 to Walnut Hills, where we saw the seminary buildings,

 the house where your sisters were born, and the house 
 in which we afterwards lived. In the afternoon we had 
 to leave and hurry away to a reading in Dayton. The 
 next evening another in Columbus, where we spent 
 Sunday with an old friend. 
 
 By this time I am somewhat rested from the strain 
 of that awful journey ; but I shall never again under 
 take such another. It was one of those things that 
 have to be done once, to learn not to do it again. My 
 only reading between Columbus and Pittsburgh is to be 
 here in Zanesville, a town as black as Acheron, and 
 where one might expect to see the river Styx. 
 
 Later. I had a nice audience and a pleasant read 
 ing here, and to-day we go on to Pittsburgh, where I 
 read to-morrow night. 
 
 I met the other day at Dayton a woman who now 
 has grandchildren ; but who, when I first came West, 
 was a gay rattling girl. She was one of the first con 
 verts of brother George s seemingly obscure ministry 
 in the little new town of Chillicothe. Now she has one 
 son who is a judge of the supreme court, and another 
 in business. Both she and they are not only Chris 
 tians, but Christians of the primitive sort, whose re 
 ligion is their all ; who triumph and glory in tribula 
 tion, knowing that it worketh patience. She told me, 
 with a bright sweet calm, of her husband killed in bat 
 tle the first year of the war, of her only daughter and 
 two grandchildren dying in the faith, and of her own 
 happy waiting on God s will, with bright hopes of a 
 joyful reunion. Her sons are leading members of the 
 Presbyterian Church, and most active in stirring up 
 others to make their profession a reality, not an empty

 name. When I thought that all this came from the 
 conversion of one giddy girl, when George seemed to 
 be doing so little, I said, &quot; Who can measure the work 
 of a faithful minister ? &quot; It is such living witnesses 
 that maintain Christianity on earth. 
 
 Good-by. We shall soon be home now, and prepar 
 ing for Florida. Always your own loving mother, 
 
 H. B. S. 
 
 Mrs. Stowe never undertook another reading tour, 
 nor, after this one, did she ever read again for money, 
 though she frequently contributed her talent in this 
 direction to the cause of charity. 
 
 The most noteworthy event of her later years was the 
 celebration of the seventieth anniversary of her birth 
 day. That it might be fittingly observed, her pub 
 lishers, Messrs. Houghton, Mifflin & Co. of Boston, 
 arranged a reception for her in form of a garden party, 
 to which they invited the literati of America. It was 
 held gn June 14, 1882, at &quot; The Old Elms,&quot; the home 
 of Ex-Governor Claflin of Massachusetts, in Newton- 
 ville, one of Boston s most beautiful suburbs. Here 
 the assembly gathered to do honor to Mrs. Stowe, that 
 lovely June afternoon, comprised two hundred of the 
 most distinguished and best known among the literary 
 men and women of the day. 
 
 From three until five o clock was spent socially. As 
 the guests arrived they were presented to Mrs. Stowe 
 by Mr. H. 0. Houghton, and then they gathered in 
 groups in the parlors, on the verandas, on the lawn, 
 and in the refreshment room. At five o clock they 
 assembled in a large tent on the lawn, when Mr. 
 

<page 548>
THE GARDEN PARTY. 501 
 
 Houghton, as host, addressed to his guest and her 
 friends a few words of congratulation and welcome. 
 He closed his remarks by saying : 
 &quot; And now, honored madam, as 
 
 &quot; When to them who sail 
 Beyond the Cape of Hope, and now are past 
 Mozambic, off at sea northeast winds blow 
 Sabean odors from the spicy shore 
 Of Arabic the blest, 
 
 so the benedictions of the lowly and the blessings of 
 all conditions of men are brought to you to-day on the 
 wings of the wind, from every quarter of the globe ; 
 but there will be no fresher laurels to crown this day 
 of your rejoicing than are brought by those now before 
 you, who have been your co-workers in the strife ; who 
 have wrestled and suffered, fought and conquered, with 
 you ; who rank you with the Miriams, the Deborahs, 
 and the Judiths of old ; and who now shout back the 
 refrain, when you utter the inspired song : 
 
 &quot; Sing ye to the Lord, for he hath triumphed gloriously. ^ 
 
 The Almighty Lord hath disappointed them by the hand of a woman. &quot; 
 
 In reply to this Mrs. Stowe s brother, Henry Ward 
 Beecher, said : &quot; Of course you all sympathize with me 
 to-day, but, standing in this place, I do not see your 
 faces more clearly than I see those of my father and 
 my mother. Her I only knew as a mere babe-child. 
 He was my teacher and my companion. A more guile 
 less soul than he, a more honest one, more free from 
 envy, from jealousy, and from selfishness, I never knew. 
 Though he thought he was great by his theology, 
 everybody else knew he was great by his religion. My

 mother is to me what the Virgin Mary is to a devout 
 Catholic. She was a woman of great nature, profound 
 as a philosophical thinker, great in argument, with a 
 kind of intellectual imagination, diffident, not talkative, 
 in which respect I take after her, the woman who 
 gave birth to Mrs. Stowe, whose graces and excellences 
 she probably more than any of her children we num 
 ber but thirteen has possessed. I suppose that in 
 bodily resemblance, perhaps, she is not like my mother, 
 but in mind I presume she is most like her. I thank 
 you for my father s sake and for my mother s sake for 
 the courtesy, the friendliness, and the kindness which 
 you give to Mrs. Stowe.&quot; 
 
 The following poem from John Greenleaf Whittier 
 was then read : 
 
 &quot; Thrice welcome from the Land of Flowers 
 And golden-fruited orange bowers 
 To this sweet, green-turfed June of ours ! 
 To her who, in our evil time, 
 Dragged into light the nation s crime 
 With strength beyond the strength of men, 
 And, mightier than their sword, her pen ; 
 To her who world- wide entrance gave 
 To the log cabin of the slave, 
 Made all his wrongs and sorrows known, 
 And all earth s languages his own, 
 North, South, and East and West, made all 
 The common air electrical, 
 Until the o ercharged bolts of heaven 
 Blazed down, and every chain was riven ! 
 
 &quot; Welcome from each and all to her 
 Whose Wooing of the Minister 
 Revealed the warm heart of the man 
 Beneath the creed-bound Puritan, 
 And taught the kinship of the love 
 Of man below and God above ; 
 

<page 550>
DR. HOLME&S POEM. 503 
 
 To her whose vigorous pencil-strokes 
 
 Sketched into life her Oldtown Folks, 
 
 Whose fireside stories, grave or gay, 
 
 In quaint Sam Lawson s vagrant way, 
 
 With Old New England s flavor rife, 
 
 Waifs from her rude idyllic life, 
 
 Are racy as the legends old 
 
 By Chaucer or Boccaccio told; 
 
 To her who keeps, through change of place 
 
 And time, her native strength and grace, 
 
 Alike where warm Sorrento smiles, 
 
 Or where, by birchen-shaded isles 
 
 Whose summer winds have shivered o er 
 
 The icy drift of Labrador, 
 
 She lifts to light the priceless Pearl 
 
 Of Harpswell s angel-beckoned girl. 
 
 To her at threescore years and ten 
 
 Be tributes of the tongue and pen, 
 
 Be honor, praise, and heart thanks given, 
 
 The loves of earth, the hopes of heaven ! 
 
 &quot; Ah, dearer than the praise that stirs 
 The air to-day, our love is hers ! 
 She needs no guaranty of fame 
 Whose own is linked with Freedom s name. 
 Long ages after ours shall keep 
 Her memory living while we sleep; 
 The waves that wash our gray coast lines, 
 The winds that rock the Southern pines 
 Shall sing of her; the unending years 
 Shall tell her tale in unborn ears. 
 And when, with sins and follies past, 
 Are numbered color-hate and caste, 
 White, black, and red shall own as one, 
 The noblest work by woman done.&quot; 
 
 It was followed by a few words from Dr. Oliver 
 Wendell Holmes, who also read the subjoined as his 
 contribution to the chorus of congratulation : 
 
 &quot; If every tongue that speaks her praise 
 For whom I shape my tinkling phrase 
 Were summoned to the table, 
 

<page 551>
504 CLOSING SCENES. 
 
 The vocal chorus that would meet 
 Of mingling accents harsh or sweet, 
 From every land and tribe, would beat 
 The polyglots of Babel. 
 
 &quot; Briton and Frenchman, Swede and Dane, 
 Turk, Spaniard, Tartar of Ukraine, 
 
 Hidalgo, Cossack, Ca&amp;lt;Ji, 
 High Dutchman and Low Dutchman, too, 
 The Russian serf, the Polish Jew, 
 Arab, Armenian, and Mantchoo 
 
 Would shout, We know the lady/ 
 
 &quot; Know her ! Who knows not Uncle Tom 
 And her he learned his gospel from, 
 
 Has never heard of Moses ; 
 Full well the brave black hand we know 
 That gave to freedom s grasp the hoe 
 That killed the weed that used to grow 
 
 Among the Southern roses. 
 
 &quot; When Archimedes, long ago, 
 Spoke out so grandly, * Dos pou sto, 
 
 Give me a place to stand on, 
 I 11 move your planet for you, now, 
 He little dreamed or fancied how 
 The sto at last should find its pou 
 
 For woman s faith to land on. 
 
 &quot; Her lever was the wand of art, 
 Her fulcrum was the human heart, 
 
 Whence all unfailing aid is; 
 She moved the earth ! Its thunders pealed, 
 Its mountains shook, its temples reeled, 
 The blood-red fountains were unsealed, 
 
 And Moloch sunk to Hades. 
 
 &quot; All through the conflict, up and down 
 Marched Uncle Tom and Old John Brown, 
 
 One ghost, one form ideal ; 
 And which was false and which was true, 
 And which was mightier of the two, 
 The wisest sibyl never knew, 
 
 For both alike were real.

MRS. STOWE S RESPONSE. 505 
 
 &quot; Sister, the holy maid does well 
 Who counts her beads in convent cell, 
 
 Where pale devotion lingers; 
 But she who serves the sufferer s needs, 
 Whose prayers are spelt in loving deeds, 
 May trust the Lord will count her beads 
 
 As well as human fingers. 
 
 * When Truth herself was Slavery s slave 
 Thy hand the prisoned suppliant gave 
 
 The rainbow wings of fiction. 
 And Truth who soared descends to-day 
 Bearing an angel s wreath away, 
 Its lilies at thy feet to lay 
 
 With heaven s own benediction.&quot; 
 
 Poems written for the occasion by Mrs. A. D. T. 
 Whitney, Miss Elizabeth Stuart Phelps, Mr. J. T. 
 Trowbridge, Mrs. Allen (Mrs. Stowe s daughter), Mrs. 
 Annie Fields, and Miss Charlotte F. Bates, were also 
 read, and speeches were made by Judge Albion W. 
 Tourgee and others prominent in the literary world. 
 
 Letters from many noted people, who were prevented 
 from being present by distance or by other engage 
 ments, had been received. Only four of them were 
 read, but they were all placed in Mrs. Stowe s hands. 
 The exercises were closed by a few words from Mrs. 
 Stowe herself. As she came to the front of the plat 
 form the whole company rose, and remained standing 
 until she had finished. In her quiet, modest, way, and 
 yet so clearly as to be plainly heard by all, she said : 
 
 &quot; I wish to say that I thank all my friends from my 
 heart, that is all. And one thing more, and that 
 is, if any of you have doubt, or sorrow, or pain, if you 
 doubt about this world, just remember what God has 
 done ; just remember that this great sorrow of slavery

 has gone, gone by forever. I see it every day at the 
 South. I walk about there and see the lowly cabins. 
 I see these people growing richer and richer. I see 
 men very happy in their lowly lot ; but, to be sure, you 
 must have patience with them. They are not perfect, 
 but have their faults, and they are serious faults in the 
 view of white people. But . they are very happy, that 
 is evident, and they do know how to enjoy themselves, 
 a great deal more than you do. An old negro 
 friend in our neighborhood has got a new, nice two- 
 story house, and an orange grove, and a sugar-mill. 
 He has got a lot of money, besides. Mr. Stowe met 
 him one day, and he said, I have got twenty head of 
 cattle, four head of &quot; hoss,&quot; forty head of hen, and I 
 have got ten children, all mine, every one mine. 9 
 Well, now, that is a thing that a black man could not 
 say once, and this man was sixty years old before he 
 could say it. With all the faults of the colored people, 
 take a man and put him down with nothing but his 
 hands, and how many could say as much as that ? I 
 think they have done well. 
 
 &quot; A little while ago they had at his house an evening 
 festival for their church, and raised fifty dollars. We 
 white folks took our carriages, and when we reached 
 the house we found it fixed nicely. Every one of his 
 daughters knew how to cook. They had a good place 
 for the festival. Their suppers were spread on little 
 white tables with nice clean cloths on them. People 
 paid fifty cents for supper. They got between fifty 
 and sixty dollars, and had one of the best frolics you 
 could imagine. They had also for supper ice-cream, 
 which they made themselves.

OLD LETTERS. 507 
 
 &quot; That is the sort of thing I see going on around me. 
 Let us never doubt. Everything that ought to happen 
 is going to happen.&quot; 
 
 Mrs. Stowe s public life ends with the garden party, 
 and little more remains to be told. She had already, 
 in 1880, begun the task of selection from the great 
 accumulation of letters and papers relating to her life, 
 and writes thus to her son in Saco, Maine, regarding 
 the work : 
 
 September 30, 1880. 
 
 MY DEAR CHARLEY, My mind has been with you 
 a great deal lately. I have been looking over and 
 arranging my papers with a view to sifting out those 
 that are not worth keeping, and so filing and arranging 
 those that are to be kept, that my heirs and assigns 
 may with the less trouble know where and what they 
 are. I cannot describe (to you) the peculiar feelings 
 which this review occasions. Reading old letters 
 when so many of the writers are gone from earth, 
 seems to me like going into the world of spirits let 
 ters full of the warm, eager, anxious, busy life, that 
 is forever past. My own letters, too, full of by-gone 
 scenes in my early life and the childish days of my 
 children. It is affecting to me to recall things that 
 strongly moved me years ago, that filled my thoughts 
 and made me anxious when the occasion and emotion 
 have wholly vanished from my mind. But I thank 
 God there is one thing running through all of them 
 from the time I was thirteen years old, and that is the 
 intense unwavering sense of Christ s educating, guid 
 ing presence and care. It is all that remains now. 
 

<page 555>
508 CLOSING SCENES. 
 
 The romance of my youth is faded, it looks to me now, 
 from my years, so very young those days when my 
 mind only lived in emotion, and when my letters never 
 were dated, because they were only histories of the in 
 ternal, but now that I am no more and never can be 
 young in this world, now that the friends of those 
 days are almost all in eternity, what remains ? 
 
 Through life and through death, through sorrowing, through sinning, 
 Christ shall suffice me as he hath sufficed. 
 Christ is the end and Christ the beginning, 
 The beginning and end of all is Christ. 
 
 I was passionate in my attachments in those far back 
 years, and as I have looked over files of old letters, 
 they are all gone (except one, C. Van Rensselaer), 
 Georgiana May, Delia Bacon, Clarissa Treat, Elisabeth 
 Lyman, Sarah Colt, Elisabeth Phenix, Frances Strong, 
 Elisabeth Foster. I have letters from them all, but 
 they have been long in spirit land and know more about 
 how it is there than I do. It gives me a sort of dizzy 
 feeling of the shortness of life and nearness of eternity 
 when I see how many that I have traveled with are 
 gone within the veil. Then there are all my own let 
 ters, written in the first two years of marriage, when 
 Mr. Stowe was in Europe and I was looking forward to 
 motherhood and preparing for it my letters when 
 my whole life was within the four walls of my nursery, 
 my thoughts absorbed by the developing character of 
 children who have now lived their earthly life and gone 
 to the eternal one, my two little boys, each in their 
 way good and lovely, whom Christ has taken in youth, 
 and my little one, my first Charley, whom He took 
 away before he knew sin or sorrow, then my brother

JOHN QUINCY ADAMS. 509 
 
 George and sister Catherine, the one a companion of 
 my youth, the other the mother who assumed the care 
 of me after I left home in my twelfth year and they 
 are gone. Then my blessed father, for many years so 
 true an image of the Heavenly Father, in all my 
 afflictions he was afflicted, in all my perplexities he was 
 a sure and safe counselor, and he too is gone upward to 
 join the angelic mother whom I scarcely knew in this 
 world, who has been to me only a spiritual presence 
 through life. 
 
 In 1882 Mrs. Stowe writes to her son certain impres 
 sions derived from reading the &quot; Life and Letters of 
 John Quincy Adams,&quot; which are given as containing a 
 retrospect of the stormy period of her own life-experi 
 ence. 
 
 &quot; Your father enjoys his proximity to the Boston 
 library. He is now reading the twelve or fourteen 
 volumes of the life and diary of John Q. Adams. It is 
 a history of our country through all the period of 
 slavery usurpation that led to the war. The industry 
 of the man in writing is wonderful. Every day s do 
 ings in the house are faithfully daguerreotyped, all 
 the mean tricks, contrivances of the slave-power, and 
 the pusillanimity of the Northern members from day to 
 day recorded. Calhoun was then secretary of state. 
 Under his connivance even the United States census 
 was falsified, to prove that freedom was bad for negroes. 
 Records of deaf, dumb, and blind, and insane colored 
 people were distributed in Northern States, and in 
 places where John Q. Adams had means of proving 
 there were no negroes. When he found that these 
 

<page 559>
510 CLOSING SCENES. 
 
 falsified figures had been used with the English em- 
 bassador as reasons for admitting Texas as a slave State, 
 the old man called on Calhoun, and showed him the 
 industriously collected proofs of the falsity of this 
 census. He says : He writhed like a trodden rattle 
 snake, but said the census was full of mistakes ; but 
 one part balanced another, it was not worth while to 
 correct them. His whole life was an incessant warfare 
 with the rapidly advancing spirit of slavery, that was 
 coiling like a serpent around everything. 
 
 &quot; At a time when the Southerners were like so many 
 excited tigers and rattlesnakes, when they bullied, 
 and scoffed, and sneered, and threatened, this old man 
 rose every day in his place, and, knowing every par 
 liamentary rule and tactic of debate, found means to 
 make himself heard. Then he presented a petition 
 from negroes, which raised a storm of fury. The old 
 man claimed that the right of petition was the right of 
 every human being. They moved to expel him. By 
 the rules of the house a man, before he can be ex 
 pelled, may have the floor to make his defense. This 
 was just what he wanted. He held the floor for four 
 teen days, and used his wonderful powers of memory 
 and arrangement to give a systematic, scathing history 
 of the usurpations of slavery ; he would have spoken 
 fourteen days more, but his enemies, finding the thing 
 getting hotter and hotter, withdrew their motion, and 
 the right of petition was gained. 
 
 &quot;What is remarkable in this journal is the minute 
 record of going to church every Sunday, and an analy 
 sis of the text and sermon. There is something about 
 these so simple, so humble, so earnest. Often differing 
 

<page 560>
A RETROSPECT. 511 
 
 from the speaker but with gravity and humility 
 he seems always to be so self -distrustful ; to have such 
 a sense of sinfulness and weakness, but such trust in 
 God s fatherly mercy, as is most beautiful to see. Just 
 the record of his Sunday sermons, and his remarks 
 upon them, would be most instructive to a preacher. 
 He was a regular communicant, and, beside, attended 
 church on Christmas and Easter, I cannot but love 
 the old man. He died without seeing even the dawn 
 of liberty which God has brought ; but oh ! I am sure 
 he sees it from above. He died in the Capitol, in the 
 midst of his labors, and the last words he said were, 
 This is the last of earth ; I am content. And now, I 
 trust, he is with God. 
 
 &quot; All, all are gone. All that raged ; all that threat 
 ened ; all the cowards that yielded ; truckled, sold their 
 country for a mess of pottage ; all the men that stood 
 and bore infamy and scorn for the truth ; all are silent 
 in dust ; the fight is over, but eternity will never efface 
 from their souls whether they did well or ill whether 
 they fought bravely or failed like cowards. In a sense, 
 our lives are irreparable. If we shrink, if we fail, if we 
 choose the fleeting instead of the eternal, God may for 
 give us ; but there must be an eternal regret ! This 
 man lived for humanity when hardest bestead ; for 
 truth when truth was unpopular ; for Christ when 
 Christ stood chained and scourged in the person of the 
 slave.&quot; 
 
 In the fall of 1887 she writes to her brother Rev. 
 Dr. Edward Beecher of Brooklyn, N. Y. :

 49 FOREST STREET, HARTFORD, CONN., October 11, 1887. 
 
 DEAR BROTHER, I was delighted to receive your 
 kind letter. You were my earliest religious teacher ; 
 your letters to me while a school-girl in Hartford gave 
 me a high Christian aim and standard which I hope 
 I have never lost. Not only did they do me good, but 
 also my intimate friends, Georgiana May and Cather 
 ine Cogswell, to whom I read them. The simplicity, 
 warmth, and childlike earnestness of those school days 
 I love to recall. I am the only one living of that circle 
 of early friends. Not one of my early schoolmates is 
 living, and now Henry, younger by a year or two 
 than I, has gone my husband also. 1 I often think, 
 Why am I spared ? Is there yet anything for me to 
 do ? I am thinking with my son Charles s help of writ 
 ing a review of my life, under the title, &quot; Pebbles from 
 the Shores of a Past Life.&quot; 
 
 Charlie told me that he has got all written up to my 
 twelfth or thirteenth year, when I came to be under sis 
 ter Catherine s care in Hartford. I am writing daily my 
 remembrances from that time. You were then, I think, 
 teacher of the Grammar School in Hartford. . . . 
 
 So, my dear brother, let us keep good heart ; no evil 
 can befall us. Sin alone is evil, and from that Christ 
 will keep us. Our journey is so short ! 
 
 I feel about all things now as I do about the things 
 that happen in a hotel, after my trunk is packed to go 
 home. I may be vexed and annoyed . . . but what of 
 it ! I am going home soon. 
 
 Your affectionate sister, HATTIE. 
 
 1 Professor Stowe died August, 1886.

THE LIFE BEYOND. 513 
 
 To a friend she writes a little later : 
 
 &quot; I have thought much lately of the possibility of my 
 leaving you all and going home. I am come to that 
 stage of my pilgrimage that is within sight of the River 
 of Death, and I feel that now I must have all in readi 
 ness day and night for the messenger of the King. I 
 have sometimes had in my sleep strange perceptions of 
 a vivid spiritual life near to and with Christ, and mul 
 titudes of holy ones, and the joy of it is like no other 
 joy, it cannot be told in the language of the world. 
 What I have then I know with absolute certainty, yet 
 it is so unlike and above anything we conceive of in 
 this world that it is difficult to put it into words. The 
 inconceivable loveliness of Christ ! It seems that about 
 Him there is a sphere where the enthusiasm of love is 
 the calm habit of the soul, that without words, without 
 the necessity of demonstrations of affection, heart beats 
 to heart, soul answers soul, we respond to the Infinite 
 Love, and we feel his answer in us, and there is no 
 need of words. All seemed to be busy coming and 
 going on ministries of good, and passing each gave 
 a thrill of joy to each as Jesus, the directing soul, 
 the centre of all, over all, in all, and through all,&quot; was 
 working his beautiful and merciful will to redeem and 
 save. I was saying as I awoke : 
 
 &quot; T is joy enough, my all in all, 
 
 At thy dear feet to lie. 
 Thou wilt not let me lower fall, 
 And none can higher fly. 
 
 &quot; This was but a glimpse ; but it has left a strange 
 sweetness in my mind.&quot;

NOVELS, STORIES, SKETCHES, AND POEMS, 
 
 BY 
 
 HARRIET BEECHER STOWE. 
 
 // is the great happiness of Mrs. Stowe not only to have written 
 many delightful books, but to have written one book which will be al 
 ways famous not only as the most vivid picture of an extinct evil sys 
 tem, but as one of the most powerful influences in overthrowing it. . . . 
 No book was ever more a historical event than &quot;Uncle Tom s Cabin. 1 
 . . . If all whom she has charmed and quickened should unite to sing 
 her praises, the birds of summer would be outdone. GEORGE WIL 
 LIAM CURTIS. 
 
 UNCLE TOM S CABIN. A Story of American Slavery. I2mo, 
 
 $2.00. 
 
 New Popular Edition from new plates. With account of the writing 
 
 of this story by Mrs. STOWE, and frontispiece. i6mo, $1.00. 
 Holiday Edition. With an Introduction of more than thirty pages by

 British Museum. With more than one hundred illustrations, and 
 red-line border. 8vo, full gilt, $3.00 ; half calf, $5.00 ; morocco, or 
 tree calf, $6.00. 
 
 The publication of this remarkable story was an event in American 
 history as v/ell as in American literature. It fixed the eyes of the na 
 tion and of the civilized world on the evils of slavery, presenting these 
 so vividly and powerfully that the heart and conscience of mankind 
 were thenceforth enlisted against them. But, aside from its graphic 
 portrayal of slavery, &quot;Uncle Tom s Cabin&quot; is a story of thrilling 
 power, and abounds in humorous delineations of negro and Yankee 
 character. Its extraordinary annual sale of thousands of copies, and 
 its translation into numerous foreign languages, attest its universal 
 and permanent interest.
