To the Lords Spiritual and
Temporal, and the Com-
mons of the Parliament of
Great Britain.
My Lord, and Gentlemen,
PERMIT me, with the greateſt
deference and reſpect, to lay at your
feet the following genuine Narra-
tive; the chief deſign of which is
to excite in your auguſt aſſemblies
a ſenſe of compaſſion for the miſe-
ries which the Slave-Trade has en-
tailed on my unfortunate country-
men. By the horrors of that trade
was 1 firſt torn away from all the
tender connexions that were natu-
rally dear to my heart; but theſe,
through

<page 15>

-
through the myſterious ways of
Providence, I ought to regard as
infinitely more than compenſated
by the introduction I have thence
obtained to the knowledge of the
Chriſtian religion, and of a nation
which, by its liberal ſentiments,
its humanity, the glorious freedom
of its government, and its profici-
cncy in arts and ſciences, has ex-
alted the dignity of human nature.
I am ſenſible I ought to entreat
your pardon for addreſſing to you
a work ſo wholly devoid of literary
merit; but, as the production of
an unlettered African, who is ac-
tuated by the hope of becoming an
inſtrument towards the relief of .
his ſuffering countrymen, I truſt
that ſuch a man, pleading in ſuch a
2. - cauſe,

<page 16>
( v )
cauſe, will be acquitted of boldneſs
and preſumption.
May the God of heaven inſpire
your hearts with peculiar benevo-
lence on that important day when
the queſtion of Abolition is to be
diſcuſſed, when thouſands, in con-
ſequence of your Determination,
are to look for Happineſsor Miſeryl

the only diſadvantage under which they
labour: it is alſo their misfortune, that
what is uncommon is rarely, if ever,
believed, and what is obvious we are
apt to turn from with diſguſt, and to
charge the writer with impertinence.
People generally think thoſe memoirs
only worthy to be read or remembered
which abound in great or ſtriking
events; thoſe, in ſhort, which in a high
degree excite either admiration or
pity: all others hey conſign to con-
tempt and oblivion. It is therefort,
I confeſs, not a little hazardous in a
private and obſcure individual, and a
ſtranger too, thus to ſolicit the indul-
gent attention of the public; eſpecially
when I own I offer here the hiſtory of
neither a ſaint, a hero, nor a tyrant. I
believe there area few events in my life,
which have not happened to many: it
is true the incidents of it are numerous;
and, did I conſidermyſelf an European
I might

I might ſay my ſufferings were great:
but when I compare my lot with that
of moſt of my countrymen, I regard
myſelf as a particular favourite ºf Hea-
ven, and acknowledge the mercies of
Providence in every occurrence of my
life. If then the following narrative
does not appear ſufficiently intereſting
to engage general attention, let my
motive be ſome excuſe for its publica-
tion. I am not ſo fooliſhly vain as to
expect from it either immortality or
literary reputation. If it affords any
ſatisfaction to my numerous friends, at
whoſe requeſt it has been written, or
in the ſmalleſt degree promotes the
intereſts of humanity, the ends for
which it was undertaken will be fully
attained, and every wiſh of my heart
gratified. Let it therefore be remem-
bered, that, in wiſhing to avoid cenſu TC,
I do not aſpire to praiſe.

That part of Africa, known by the
name of Guinea, to which the trade
for ſlaves is carried on, extends along
the coaſt above 34oo miles, from Se-
negal to Angola, and includes a vari-
ety of kingdoms. Of theſe the moſt
confiderable is the kingdom of Benin,
both as to extent and wealth, the
richneſs and cultivation of the foil,
the power of its king, and the number
and warlike diſpoſition of the inhabi-
tants. It is ſituated nearly under the
line, and extends along the coaſt about
170 miles, but runs back into the in-
tertior part of Africa to a diſtance hi-
therto I believe unexplored by any
traveller; and ſeems only terminated
at length by the empire of Abyſſinia,
near I soo miles from its beginning.
This kingdom is divided into many
provinces or diſtricts: in one of the
moſt remote and fertile of which,
I

<page 40>
| 5 ||
I was born, in the year 1745, ſitu
ated in a charming fruitful vale,
named Eſſaka. The diſtance of this
province from the capital of Benin and
the ſea coaſt muſtbevery conſiderables
for I had never heard of white men or
Europeans, nor of the ſea; and our
ſubjection to the king of Benin was
little more than nominal; for every
tranſaction of the government, as far as
my ſlender obſervation extended, was
conducted by the chiefs or elders of
the place. The manners and govern-
ment of a people who have little com-
merce with other countries are gene-
rally very ſimple; and the hiſtory of
what paſſes in one family or village, may


ſerve as aſpecimen of the whole nation.
My father was one of thoſe elders or
chiefs I have ſpoken of, and was ſtyled

fighifying in our language a mark of
grandeur. This mark is conferred on
the perſon entitled to it, by cutting the
ſkin acroſs at the top of the forehead,
and drawing it down to the eye-brows;
and while it is in this ſituation apply-
ing a warm hand, and rubbing it
until it ſhrinks up into a thick weal
acroſs the lower part of the forehead.
Moſt of the judges and ſenators were
thus marked; my father had long borne
it: I had ſeen it conferred on one of
my brothers, and I alſo was dºned to
receive it by my parents. Thoſe Em-
brenché or chief men, decided diſputes
and puniſhed crimes; for which pur-
poſe they always aſſembled together.
The proceedings were generally ſhort;
and in moſt caſes the law of retaliation
prevailed. I remember a man was
brought before my father, and the
other-judges, for kidnapping a boy;
- and,

<page 42>
[ 7 J
and, although he was the ſon of a chief
or ſenator, he was condemned to make
recompenſe by a man or woman ſlave.
Adultery, however, was ſometimes pu-
niſhed with ſlavery or death; a puniſh-
ment which I believe is inflicted on
it throughout moſt of the nations of
Africa": ſo ſacred among them is the
honour of the marriage bed, and ſo
jealous are they of the fidelity of their
wives. Of this I recollect an inſtance
—a woman was convićted before the
judges of adultery, and delivered over,
as the cuſtom was, to her huſband to
be puniſhed. Accordingly he deter-
mined to put her to death: but it being
found, juſt before her execution, that
ſhe had an infant at her breaſt; and no
woman being prevailed on to perform
the part of a nurſe, ſhe was ſpared on

account of the child. The men, how-
ever, do not preſerve the ſame con-
ſtancy to their wives, which they ex-
ped from them; for they indulge in
a plurality, though ſeldom in more
than two. Their mode of marriage
is thus:–both parties are uſually be-
trothed when young by their parents,
(though I have known the males to
betroth themſelves). On this occaſion
a feaſt is prepared, and the bride and
bridegroom ſtand up in the midſt of
all their friends, who are aſſembled for
the purpoſe, while he declares ſhe is
thenceforth to be lºoked upon as his
wife, and that no other perſon is to
pay any adºs to her. This is alſo
immediately proclaimed in the vici-
mily, on which the bride retires ſºon
the aſſembly. Some time after ne is
brought home to her huſband, and
then another ſeaſº is made, to which

the relations of both parties are in-
vited: her parents then deliver her to
the bridegroom, accompanied with a
number of bleſfings, and at the ſame
time they tie round her waiſt a cotton
ſtring of the thickneſs of a gooſe-quill,
which none but married women are
permitted to wear: ſhe is now confi-
dered as completely his wife; and at
this time the dowry is given to the
new married pair, which generally
conſiſts of portions of land, ſlaves, and
cattle, houſehold goods, and imple-
ments of huſbandry. Theſe are of
fered by the friends of both parties;
beſides which the parents of the bride-
groom preſent gifts to thoſe of the
bride, whoſe property ſhe is looked
upon before marriage; but after it ſhe
is eſteemed the ſole property of her
huſband. The ceremony being now

acclamations of joy, accompanied with
muſic and dancing. -
We are almoſt a nation of dancers,
muſicians, and poets. Thus every great
event, ſuch as a triumphant return
from battle, or other cauſe of public
rejoicing is celebrated in public dances
which are accompanied with ſongs and
muſic ſuited to the occaſion. The aſ-
ſembly is ſeperated into four diviſions,
which dance either apart or in ſuc-
ceſſion, and each with a character pe—
culiar to itſelf. The firſt diviſion
contains the married men, who in
their dances frequently exhibit feats
of arms, and the repreſentation of a
battle. To theſe ſucceed the married
women, who dance in the ſecond di-
viſion. The young men accupy the
third; and the maidens the fourth.
Each repreſents ſome intereſting ſcene

ofreallife, ſuch as a great achievement,
domeſtic employment, a pathetic ſtory,
or ſome rural ſport; and as the ſubject
is generally founded on ſome recent
event, it is therefore ever new. This
gives our dances a ſpirit and variety
which I have ſcarcely ſeen elſewhere".
We have many muſical inſtruments,
particularly drums of different kinds,
a piece of muſic which reſembles a
guitar, and another much like a
ſtickado. Theſe laſt are chiefly uſed
by betrothed virgins, who play on
them on an grand feſtivals.
As our manners are ſimple, our
luxuries are few. The dreſs of both
ſexes is nearly the ſame. It generally

we have ſome ſmall pieces of coin, if
I may call them ſuch. They are

at which I have been frequently with

procuring them before they are ſuffered
to paſs. Sometimes indeed we ſold
ſlaves to them, but they were only
priſoners of war, or ſuch among us as
had been convićted of kidnapping, or
adultery, and ſome other crimes, which
we eſteemed heinous. This practice
of kidnapping induces me to think,
that, notwithſtanding all our ſtrictneſs,

to trepan our people. I remember
too they carried great ſacks along with

ºpportunity of fatally ſeeing applied tº
that infamous purpoſe.
Our land is uncommonly rich and
fruitful, and produces all kinds of vege-
tables in great abundance. We have
plenty of Indian corn, and vaſt quan-
tities of cotton and tobacco. Our pine
apples grow without culture; they are
about the ſize of the largeſt ſugar-loaf
and finely flavoured. We have alſo
ſpices of different kinds, particularly
pepper; and a variety of delicious fruits
which I have never ſeen in Europe;
together with gums of various kinds,
and honey in abundance. All our in-
duſtry is exerted to improve thoſe
bleſſings of nature. Agriculture is out
chief employment; and everyone, even
the children and women, are engaged
in it. Thus we are all habituated to

pºon ſtock; and as we are unacquainted
with idleneſs, we have no beggars.
The benefits of ſuch a mode of living
are obvious. The Weſt India planters
prefer the ſlaves of Benin or Eboe, to
thoſe of any other part of Guinea, for
their hardineſs, intelligence, integrity,
and zeal. Thoſe benefits are felt by
us in the general healthineſs of the
people, and in their vigour and acti-
vity; I might have added too in their
comelineſs. Deformity is indeed un-
known amongſt us, I mean that of
ſhape. Numbers of the natives of Eboe
now in London, might be brought in
ſupport of this aſſertion: for, in regard
to complexion, ideas of beauty are
wholly relative. I remember while in
Africa to have ſeen three negro chil-
dren, who were tawny, and another
quite white, who were univerſally re-
garded by myſelf, and the natives in

general, as far as related to their com-
plexions, as deformed. Our women too
were in my eyes at leaſt uncommonly
graceful, alert, and modeſt to a degree of
baſhfulneſs; nor do I remember to have
ever heard of an inſtance of inconti-
nence amongſt them before marriage.
They are alſo remarkably cheerful.
Indeed cheerfulneſs and affability are
two of the leading characteriſtics of
our nation.
Our tillage is exerciſed in a large
plain or common, ſome hours walk
from our dwellings, and all the neigh-
bours reſort thither in a body. They
uſe no beaſts of huſbandry; and their
only inſtruments are hoes, axes, ſhovels,
and beaks, or pointed iron to dig with.
Sometimes we are viſited by locuſts,
which come in large clouds, ſo as to
darken the air, and deſtroy our harveſt.
This however happens rarely, but when
1.

it does, a famine is produced by it.
I remember an inſtance or two where-
in this happened. This common is
often the theatre of war; and therefore
when our people go out to till their
land, they not only go in a body,
but generally take their arms with
them for fear of a ſurpriſe; and when
they apprehend an invaſion, they guard
the avenues to their dwellings, by
driving ſticks into the ground, which
are ſo ſharp at one end as to pierce the
foot, and are generally dºpt in poiſon.
From what I can recolle&t of theſe
battles, they appear to have been irrup-
tions of one little ſtate or diſtrict on the
other, to obtain priſoners or booty.
Perhaps they were incited to this by
thoſe traders who brought the Euro-
pean goods I mentioned amongſt us.
Such a mode of obtaining ſlaves in
Africa is common; and I believe more
are


<page 59>
[ 24
are procured this way, and by kidnap-
ing, than any other". When a trader
wants ſlaves, he applies to a chief for
them, and tempts him with his wares.
It is not extraordinary, if on this occa-
ſion he yields to the temptation with as
little firmneſs, and accepts the price of
his fellow creatures liberty with as little
reluctance as the enlightened merchant.
Accordingly he falls on his neighbours,
and a deſperate battle enſues. If he
prevails and takes priſoners, he gratifies
his avarice by ſelling them; but, if his
party be vanquiſhed, and he falls into the
hands of the enemy, he is put to death:
for, as he has been known to foment
their quarrels, it is thought dangerous
to let him ſurvive, and no ranſom can
ſave him, though all other priſoners
may be redeemed. We have fire-
arms, bows and arrows, broad two-

ſhields alſo which cover a man from

of theſe weapons; even our women are
warriors, and march boldly out to fight
along with the men. Our whole diſ-
trićt is a kind of militia: on a certain
ſignal given, ſuch as the firing of a gun
at night, they all riſe in arms and ruſh
upon their enemy. It is perhaps ſome–
thing remarkable, that when our people
march to the field a red flag or banner
is borne before them. I was once a

fighting for a conſiderable time with
great fury, and many had been kil-
led, our people obtained the victory,
and took their enemy’s Chief priſoner,
He was carried off in great triumph,
and, though he offered a large ranſom
for his life, he was put to death. A
virgin of note among our enemies had
been ſlain in the battle, and her arm
was expoſed in our market-place, where
our trophies were always exhibited.
The ſpoils were divided according to
the merit of the warriors. Thoſe
priſoners which were not ſold or re-
deemed we kept as ſlaves: but how
different was their condition from that
of the ſlaves in the Weſt Indies! With
us they do no more work than other
members of the community, even
their maſter; their food, clothing and
lodging were nearly the ſame as theirs,
(except that they were not permitted
to

[ 27
to eat with thoſe who were free-born);
and there was ſcarce any other differ-
ence between them, than a ſuperior
degree of importance which the head
of a family poſſeſſes in our ſtate, and
that authority which, as ſuch, he ex-
erciſes over every part of his houſehold.
Some of theſe ſlaves have even ſlaves
under them as their own property, and
for their own uſe.
As to religion, the natives believe
that there is one Creator of all things,
and that he lives in the ſun, and is
girted round with a belt that he may
never eat or drink; but, according to
ſome, he ſmokes a pipe, which is our
own favourite luxury. They believe
he governs events, eſpecially our deaths
or captivity; but, as for the doctrine of
eternity, I do not remember to have
ever heard of it: ſome however be-

a certain degree. Thoſe ſpirits, which
are not tranſmigrated, ſuch as their
dear friends or relations, they believe al-
ways attend them, andguard them from
the bad ſpirits or their foes. For this
reaſon they always before eating, as I
have obſerved, put ſome ſmall portion
of the meat, and pour ſome of their
drink, on the ground for them; and
they often make oblations of the blood
of beaſts or fowls at their graves. I
was very fond of my mother, and al-
moſt conſtantly with her. When ſhe
went to make theſe oblations at her
mother's tomb, which was a kind of
ſmall ſolitary thatched houſe, I ſome-
times attended her. There ſhe made her
libations, and ſpent moſt of the night
in cries and lamentations. I have been
often extremely terrified on theſe oc-
caſions. The lonelineſs of the place,
the darkneſs of the night, and the cere-
* mony

<page 64>

[ 29 J
mony of libation, naturally awful and
gloomy, were heightened by my mo-
ther's lamentations; and theſe concur-
ring with the doleful cries of birds, by
which theſe places were frequented,
gave an inexpreſſible terror to the
ſcene.
We compute the year from the day
on which the ſun croſſes the line, and
on its ſetting that evening, there is a
general ſhout throughout the land; at
leaſt I can ſpeak from my own know-
ledge, throughout our vicinity. The
people at the ſame time make a great
noiſe with rattles, not unlike the baſket
rattles uſed by children here, though
much larger, and hold up their hands
to heaven for a bleſſing. It is then
the greateſt offerings are made; and
thoſe children whom our wiſe men
foretel will be fortunate are then pre-
ſented to different people. I remember

was carried about to others for that
purpoſe. They have many offerings,
particularly at full moons; generally
two at harveſt before the fruits are
taken out of the ground: and when
any young animals are killed, ſome
times they offer up part of them as a
ſacrifice. Theſe offerings, when made
by one of the heads of a family, ſerve
for the whole. I remember we often
had them at my father's and my uncle's,
and their families have been preſent.
Some of our offerings are eaten with
bitter herbs. We had a ſaying amongus
to any one of a croſs temper, “That
“if they were to be eaten, they ſhould
* be eaten with bitter herbs.”
We practiſed circumciſion like the
Jews, and made offerings and feaſts
on that occaſion in the ſame manner
as they did. Like them alſo, our
children

children were named from ſome event,
ſome circumſtance, or fancied forebod–
ing at the time of their birth. I was
named Olaudah, which, in our language,
fignifies viciſſitude, or fortunate alſo;
one favoured, and having a loud voice
and well ſpoken. I rememberwe never
polluted the name of the object of our
adoration; on the contrary, it was
always mentioned with the greateſt re-
werence; and we were totally unac-
quainted with ſwearing, and all thoſe
terms of abuſe and reproach which find
their way ſo readily and copiouſly into
the language of more civilized people.
The only expreſſions of that kind I
remember were, ‘May you rot, or
“may you ſwell, or may a beaſt take
“you.’
I have before remarked that the
natives of this part of Africa are ex-
tremely cleanly. This neceſſary habit

of decency was with us a part of reli-
gion, and therefore we had many puri-
fications and waſhings; indeed almoſt
as many, and uſed on the ſame occa-
fions, if my recollection does not fail
me, as the Jews. Thoſe that touched
the dead at any time were obliged to
waſh and purify themſelves before they
could enteradwelling-houſe. Everywo-
man too, at certaintimes, was forbidden
to come into a dwelling-houſe, or touch
any perſon, or anything we eat. I was
ſo fond of my mother I could not keep
from her, or avoid touching her at
ſome of thoſe periods, in conſequence
of which I was obliged to be kept

that purpoſe, till offering was made,

or whether they were united in the

great reverence by the people. They
calculated our time, and foretold events,
as their name imported, for we called

calculators or yearly men, our year
being called Ah-affoe. They wore
their beards, and when they died they
were ſuceeded by their ſons. Moſt
of their implements and things of value
were interred along with them. Pipes
and tobacco were alſo put into the
grave with the corpſe, which was al-

animals were offered in ſacrifice to

louſy, theft, and poiſoning; the ſucceſs
of which no doubt they derived from
the unbounded influence over the
credulity and ſuperſtition of the people.

whom I firſt drew my breath. And
here I cannot forbear ſuggeſting what

the ſtrong analogy which even by this

prevail in the manners and cuſtoms of
my countrymen and thoſe of the Jews,

and particularly the patriarchs while
they were yet in that paſtoral ſtate
which is deſcribed in Geneſis—an ana-
logy, which alone would induce me to
think that the one people had ſprung
from the other. Indeed this is the
opinion of Dr. Gill, who, in his
commentary on Geneſis, very ably de-
duces the pedigree of the Africans
from Afer and Afra, the deſcendants
of Abraham by Keturah his wife and
concubine (for both theſe titles are

applied to her). It is alſo conformable
to the ſentiments of Dr. John Clarke,
formerly Dean of Sarum, in his Truth
of the Chriſtian Religion: both theſe
authors concur in aſcribing to us this
original. Thereaſonings of thoſe gen-
tlemen are ſtill further confirmed by
the ſcripture chronology; and if any
further corroboration were required,
this reſemblance in ſo many reſpects
is a ſtrong evidence in ſupport of
the opinion. Like the Iſraelites in
their primitive ſtate, our government
was conducted by our chiefs or judges,
our wiſemen and elders; and the head
of a family with us enjoyed a ſimilar
authority over his houſehold with that
which is aſcribed to Abraham and the
other patriarchs. The law of retalia-
tion obtained almoſt univerſally with us
as with them: and even their religion
appeared to have ſhed upon us a ray of

with which time, tradition, and igno-

we had our circumciſion (a rule I
believe peculiar to that people:) we

ings, our waſhings and purifications,

As to the difference of colour be-
tween the Eboan Africans and the mo-
dern Jews, I ſhall not preſume to ac-

I Hope the reader will not think
I have treſpaſſed on his patience in
introducing myſelf to him with ſome
account of the manners and cuſtoms
of my country. They had been im-
planted

<page 81>

I 46 )
planted in me with great care, and
made an impreſſion on my mind,
which time could not eraſe, and which
all the adverſity and variety of fortune
I have ſince experienced, ſerved only
to rivet and record; for, whether the
love of one's country be real or imagi-
nary, or a leſſon of reaſon, oran inſtinct
of nature, I ſtill look back with plea-
ſure on the firſt ſcenes of my life,
though that pleaſure has been for the
moſt part mingled with forrow.
I have already acquainted the reader
with the time and place of my birth.
My father, beſides many ſlaves, had a
numerous family, of which ſeven lived
to grow up, including myſelf and a
ſiſter, who was the only daughter. As
I was the youngeſt of the ſons, I be-
came, of courſe, the greateſt favourite
with my mother, and was always with
her ; and ſhe uſed to take particular
- pains
o
-

<page 82>

47 1
pains to form my mind. I was trained
up from my earlieſt years in the art of
war: my daily exerciſe was ſhooting and
throwing javelins; and my mother
adorned me with emblems, after the
mannerofour greateſt warriors. In this
way I grew up till I was turned the age
of eleven, when an end was put to my
happineſs in the following manner:—
Generally when the grown people in the
neighbourhood were gone far in the
fields to labour, the children aſſembled
together in ſome of the neighbours'
premiſes to play; and commonly ſome
of us uſed to get up a tree to look out
for any affailant, or kidnapper, that
might come upon us; for they ſome-
times took thoſe opportunities of our
parents abſence to attack and carry off
as many as they could ſeize. One day,
as I was watching at the top of a tree
in our yard, I ſaw one of thoſe people
€Ome



<page 83>


| 4:3 )
come into the yard of our next neigh-
bour but one, to kidnap, there being
many ſtout young people init. Imme-
diately on this I gave the alarm of the
rogue, and he was ſurrounded by the
ſtouteſt of them, who entangled him
with cords, ſo that he could not eſcape
till ſome of the grown people came
and ſecured him. But alas!ere longit
was my fate to be thus attacked, and
to be carried off, when none of the
grown people were nigh. One day,
when all our people were gone out to
their works as uſual, and only I and
my dear ſiſter were left to mind the
houſe, two men and a woman got over
our walls, and in a moment ſeized us
both, and, without giving us time to cry
out, or make reſiſtance, they ſtopped
our mouths, and ran off with us, into
the neareſt wood. Here they tied our
hands, and continued to carry us as
2 far

<page 84>

| 49 |
far as they could, till night came on,
when we reached a ſmall houſe, where
the robbers halted for refreſhment
and ſpent the night. We were then
unbound, but were unable to take any
food; and, being quite overpowered
by fatigue and grief, out only relief
was ſome ſleep, which allayed our
misfortune for a ſhort time. The next
morning we left the houſe, and con-
tinued travelling all the day. For a
long time we had kept the woods, but
at laſt we came into a road which I
believed I knew. I had now ſome
hopes of being delivered; for we had
advanced but a little way before I diſ.
covered ſome people at a diſtance, on
which I began to cry out for their aſ-
ſiſtance; but my cries had no other
effect than to make them tie me faſter
and ſtop my mouth, and then they
put me into a large ſack, They alſo
Vol. 1. D ſtopped

<page 85>


| So I
ſtopped my ſiſter's mouth, and tied
her hands; and in this manner we
proceeded till we were out of the fight
of theſe people. When we went to

reſt the following night they offered
us ſome victuals; but we refuſed it;
and the only comfort we had was in
being in one another's arms all that
night, and bathing each other with our
tears. But alas! we were ſoon de-
prived of even the ſmall comfort of
weeping together. The next day
proved a day of greater ſorrow than I
had yet experienced; for my ſiſter and
I were then ſeparated, while we lay
claſped in each others arms. It was
in vain that we befought them not to
part us; ſhe was torn from me, and
immediately carried away, while I was
left in a ſtate of diſtraction not to be
deſcribed. I cried and grieved con-
tinually; and for ſeveral days did not
eat

<page 86>

[ 51
eat anything but what they forced
into my mouth. At length, after
many days travelling, during which I
had often changed maſters, I got into
the hands of a chieftain, in a very
pleaſant country. This man had two
wives and ſome children, and they all
º uſed me extremely well, and did all
they could to comfort me; particu-
larly the firſt wife, who was ſomething
|
like my mother. Although I was a
great many days journey from my
father's houſe, yet theſe people ſpoke
exactly the ſame language with us.
This firſt maſter of mine, as I may -
call him, was a ſmith, and my prin-
cipal employment was working his
bellows, which were the ſame kind as
I had ſeen in my vicinity. They were
in ſome reſpects not unlike the ſtoves
here in gentlemen's kitchens; and were
covered over with leather; and in the
D 2 middle

<page 87>

[ 52
middle of that leather a ſtick was
fixed, and a perſon ſtood up, and
worked it, in the ſame manner as is
done to pump water out of a caſk with
a hand pump. I believe it was gold
he worked, for it was of a lovely
bright yellow colour, and was worn
by the women on their wriſts and
ancies. I was there I ſuppoſe about a
month, and they at laſt uſed to truſt
meſome little diſtance from the houſe.
This liberty I uſed in embracing every
opportunity to inquire the way to my
own home; and I alſo ſometimes, for the
ſame purpoſe, went with the maidens,
in the cool of the evenings, to bring
pitchers of water from the ſprings for
the uſe of the houſe. I had alſo re-
marked where the ſun roſe in the morn-
ing, and ſet in the evening, as I had
travelled along; and I had obſerved
that my father's houſe was towards the
riſing

<page 88>

[ 53
riſing of the ſun. I therefore deter-
mined to ſeize the firſt opportunity of
making my eſcape, and to ſhape my
courſe for that quarter; for I was quite
oppreſſed and weighed down by grief
after my mother and friends; and
my love of liberty, ever great, was
ſtrengthened by the mortifying cir-
cumſtance of not daring to cat with
the free-born children, although I was
moſtly their companion. While I was
projecting my eſcape, one day an un-
lucky event happened, which quite
diſconcerted my plan, and put an end
to my hopes. I uſed to be ſometimes
employed in aſſiſting an elderly woman
ſlave, to cook and take care of the
poultry; and one morning, while I was
feeding ſome chickens, I happened to
toſs a ſmall pebble at one of them,
which hit it on the middle, and direct-
ly killed it. The old ſlave, having
D 3 ſoon


<page 89>


[ 54 I
ſoon after miſſed the chicken, inquired
after it; and on my relating the acci-
dent (for I told her the truth, becauſe
my mother would never ſuffer me to
tell a lie) ſhe flew into a violent paſ-
fion, threatened that I ſhould ſuffer
for it; and, my maſter being out,
ſhe immediately went and told her
miſtreſs what I had done. This alarm-
ed me very much, and I expected
an inſtant flogging, which to me was
uncommonly dreadful; for I had ſel-
dom been beaten at home. I therefore
reſolved to fly; and accordingly I ran
into a thicket that was hard by, and
hid myſelf in the buſhes. Soon aſ
terwards my miſtreſs and the ſlave
returned, and, not ſeeing me, they
ſearched all the houſe, but not finding
me, and I not making anſwer when
they called to me, they thought I
ad run away, and the whole neigh-
bourhood

<page 90>

[ 55 -
bourhood was raiſed in the purſuit of
me. In that part of the country (as
in ours) the houſes and villages were
ſkirted with woods, or ſhrubberies,
and the buſhes were ſo thick that a
man could readily conceal himſelf in
them, ſo as to elude the ſtrićteſt ſearch.
The neighbours continued the whole
day looking for me, and ſeveral times
many of them came within a few yards
of the place where I lay hid. I ex-
pected every moment, when I heard
a ruſtling among the trees, to be found
out, and puniſhed by my maſter: but
they never diſcovered me, though they
were often ſo near that I even heard
their conjectures as they were looking
about for me; and I now learned from
them, that any attempt to return home
would be hopeleſs. Moſt of them
ſuppoſed I had fled towards home;
D 4 but


<page 91>
[ 56
but the diſtance was ſo great, and the
way ſo intricate, that they thought I
could never reach it, and that I ſhould
be loſt in the woods. When I heard
this I was ſeized with a violent panic,
and abandoned myſelf to deſpair.
Night too began to approach, and ag-
gravated all my fears. I had before
cntertained hopes of getting home,
and had determined when it ſhould
be dark to make the attempt; but I
was now convinced it was fruitleſs,
and began to conſider that, if poſſibly
I could eſcape all other animals, I
could not thoſe of the human kind;
and that, not knowing the way, I muſt
periſh in the woods. Thus was I like
the hunted deer:
—“Ev'ry leaf and ev'ry whiſpring breath
“Convey’d a foe, and ev'ry foe a death.”
I heard frequent ruſtlings among the
leaves; and being pretty ſure they were
ſnakes,


<page 92>

[ 57 )
ſnakes, I expected every inſtant to be
ſtung by them. This increaſed my
anguiſh, and the horror of my ſituation
became now quite inſupportable. I at
length quitted the thicket, very faint
and hungry, for I had not eaten or
drank anything all the day; and crept
to my maſter's kitchen, from whence
I ſet out at firſt, and which was an open
ſhed, and laid myſelf down in the
aſhes with an anxious wiſh for death to
relieve me from all my pains. I was
ſcarcely awake in the morning, when
the old woman ſlave, who was the firſt
up, came to light the fire, and ſaw
me in the fire place. She was very
much ſurpriſed to ſee me, and could
fearcely believe her own eyes. She
now promiſed to intercede for me, and
went for her maſter, who ſoon after
came and having ſlightly reprimanded



D 5 Iſic,

<page 93>


I 8 J
me, ordered me to be taken care of,
and not ill treated.
Soon after this my maſter's only
daughter, and child by his firſt wife,
ſickened and died, which affected him
ſo much that for ſome time he was
almoſt frantic, and really would have
killed himſelf, had he not been watch-
edand prevented. However, in a ſmall
time afterwards he recovered, and I
was again ſold. I was now carried to
the left of the ſun's riſing, through many
dreary waſtes and diſmal woods, amidſt
the hideous roarings of wildbeaſts. The
people I was ſold to uſed to carrymevery
often, when I was tired, either on their
ſhoulders or on their backs. I ſaw many
convenient well-built ſheds along the
road, at proper diſtances, to accom-
modate the merchants and travellers,
who lay in thoſe buildings along with
their

<page 94>

[ 59
their wives, who often accompany
them; and they always go well
armed. -
From the time I left my own nation
I always found ſomebody that under-
flood me till I came to the ſea coaſt.
The languages of different nations did
not totally differ, nor were they ſo co-
pious as thoſe of the Europeans, par-
ticularly the Engliſh. They were
therefore eaſily learned; and, while I
was journeying thus through Africa,
I acquired two or three different
tongues. In this manner I had been
travelling for a conſiderable time,
when one evening to my great ſur-
priſe, whom ſhould I ſee brought to the
houſe where I was but my dear ſiſter
As ſoon as ſhe ſaw me ſhe gave a loud
ſhriek, and ran into my arms—I was
quite overpowered: neither ofus could
ſpeak; but, for a conſiderable time,
D 6 clung

[ 6o
clung to each otherinmutual embraces,
unable to do anything but weep. Our
meeting affected all who ſaw us; and
indeed I muſt acknowledge, in honour
of thoſe ſable deſtroyers of human
rights, that I never met with any ill
treatment, or ſaw any offered to their
ſlaves, except tying them, when ne-
ceſſary, to keep them from running
away. When theſe people knew we
were brotherand ſiſter, they indulged us
to be together; and the man, to whom I
ſuppoſed we belonged, lay with us, he
in the middle, while ſhe and I held one
another by the hands acroſs his breaſt
all night; and thus for a while we
forgot our misfortunes in the joy of
being together: but even this ſmall
comfort was ſoon to have an end; for
ſcarcely had the fatal morning appear-
ed, when ſhe was again torn from me
for ever! I was now more miſerable,
if


<page 96>

f 61 ||
if poſſible, than before. The ſmaſſ
relief which her preſence gave me from
pain was gone, and the wretchedneſs
of my ſituation was redoubled by my
anxiety after her fate, and my appre-
henſions left her ſufferings ſhould be:
greater than mine, when I could not
be with her to alleviate them. Yes,
thou dear partner of all my childiſh
ſports thou ſharer of my joys and
ſorrows! happy ſhould I have ever
eſteemed myſelf to encounter every
miſery for you, and to procure your
freedom by the ſacrifice of my own.
Though you were early forced from
my arms, your image has been always
rivetted in my heart, from which neither
time nor fortune have been able to re-
move it; ſo that, while the thoughts
of your ſufferings have damped my
proſperity, they have mingled with
adverſity and increaſed its bitterneſs.
- To

<page 97>

62
To that Heaven which protećts the
weak from the ſtrong, I commit the
care of your innocence and virtues, if
they have not already received their
full reward, and if your youth and
delicacy have not long ſince fallen vic-
tims to the violence of the African
trader, the peſtilential ſtench of a
Guinea ſhip, the ſeaſoning in the Euro-
pean colonies, or the laſh and luſt of
a brutal and unrelenting overſeer.
I did not long remain after my ſiſter.
I was again ſold, and carried througha
number of places, till, after travelling
a conſiderable time, I came to a town
called Tinmah, in the moſt beautiful
country. I had yet ſeen in Africa. It was
extremely rich, and there were many
rivulets which flowed through it, and
ſupplied a large pond in the centre of
the town, where the people waſhed.
Here I firſt ſaw and taſted cocoanuts,
which

<page 98>

L 63 ]
which I thought ſuperior to any nuts 1
had ever taſted before; and the trees,
which were loaded, were alſo interſperſ-
ed amongſt the houſes, which had com-
modious ſhades adjoining, and were
in the ſame manner as ours, the inſides
being neatly plaſtered and whitewaſhed,
Here I alſo ſaw and taſted for the firſt
timefugar-cane. Their money conſiſted
of little white ſhells, the ſize of the fin-
ger nail. I was ſold here for one hundred
and ſeventy-two of them by a merchant
who lived and brought me there. I
had been about two or three days at
his houſe, when a wealthy widow, a
neighbour of his, came there one even-
ing, and brought with her an only
ſon, a young gentleman about my own
age and ſize. Here they ſaw me; and,
having taken a fancy to me, I was
bought of the merchant, and went
home with them. Her houſe and
premiſes



<page 99>


[ 64
premiſes were ſituated cloſe to one of
thoſe rivulets I have mentioned, and
were the fineſt I ever ſaw in Africa:
they were very extenſive, and ſhe had
a number of ſlaves to attend her. The
next day I was waſhed and perfumed,
and when meal-time came, I was led
into the preſence of my miſtreſs, and
eat and drank before her with her ſon.
This filled me with aſtoniſhment; and
I could ſcarce help expreſſing my fur-
priſe that the young gentleman ſhould
ſuffer me, who was bound, to eat with
him who was free; and not only ſo,
but that he would notatany time either
eat or drink till I had taken firſt, be-
cauſe I was the eldeſt, which was
agreeable to our cuſtom. Indeed every
thing here, and all their treatment of
me, made me forget that I was a ſlave.
The language of theſe people reſem-
bled ours ſo nearly, that we underſtood
each

<page 100>

f 65 |
each other perfectly. They had alſo
the very ſame cuſtoms as we. There
were likewiſe ſlaves daily to attend us,
while my young maſter and I with
other boys ſported with our darts and
bows and arrows, as I had been uſed
to do at home. In this reſemblance
to my former happy ſtate, I paſſed
about two months; and I now began
to think I was to be adopted into the
family, and was beginning to be re-
conciled to my ſituation, and to for-
get by degrees my misfortunes, when
all at once the deluſion vaniſhed; for,
without the leaſt previous knowledge,
one morning early, while my dear
maſter and companion was ſtill aſleep,
I was awakened out of my reverie to
freſh forrow, and hurried away even
amongſt the uncircumciſed.
Thus, at the very moment I dreamed
ºf the greateſt happineſs, I found my-
ſelf

<page 101>

[ 66 J
ſelf moſt miſerable; and it ſeemed as if
fortune wiſhed to give me this taſte of
joy, only to render the reverſe more
poignant. The change I now expe-
rienced was as painful as it was ſudden
and unexpected. It was a change in-
deed from a ſtate of bliſs to a ſcene
which is inexpreſſible by me, as it
diſcovered to me an element I had
never before beheld, and till then had
no idea of, and wherein ſuch inſtances
of hardſhip and cruelty continually oc-
curred as I can never reflect on but
with horror.
All the nations and people I had
hitherto paſſed through reſembled out
own in their manners, cuſtoms, and
language: but I came at length to
a country, the inhabitants of which
differed from usin all thoſe particulars.
I was very much ſtruck with this diſ-
ference, eſpecially when I came among
a people

<page 102>

[ 67
a people who did not circumciſe, and
cat without waſhing their hands. They
cooked alſo in iron pots, and had Euro-
pean cutlaſſes and croſs bows, which
were unknown to us, and fought with
their fiſts amongſt themſelves. Their
women were not ſo modeſt as Ours,
for they eat, and drank, and ſlept,
with their men. But above all, I was
amazed to ſee no ſacrifices or offerings
among them. In ſome of thoſe places
the people ornamented themſelves with
ſcars, and likewiſe filed their teeth
very ſharp. They wanted ſometimes
to ornament me in the ſame manner,
but I would not ſuffer them; hoping
that I might ſome time be among a
people who did not thus disfigure them-
felves, as I thought they did. At laſt
I came to the banks of a large river,
which was covered with canoes, in
which the people appeared to live

with


<page 103>


ſ 68
with their houſehold utenſils and pro-
viſions of all kinds. I was beyond
meaſure aſtoniſhed at this, as I had
never before ſeen any water larger than
a pond or a rivulet; and my ſurpriſe
was mingled with no ſmall fear when
I was put into one of theſe canoes,
and we began to paddle and move
along the river. We continued going
on thus till night; and when we came
to land, and made fires on the banks,
each family by themſelves, ſome dragged
their canoes on ſhore, others ſtayed and
cooked in theirs, and laid in them all
night. Thoſe on the land had mats,
of which they made tents, ſome in the
ſhape of little houſes: in theſe weſlept:
and after the morning meal, we em-
barked again and proceeded as before.
I was often very much aſtoniſhed to
fee ſome of the women, as well as the
men, jump into the water, dive to the
bottom,

<page 104>

H 69 |
bottom, come up again, and ſwim
about. Thus I continued to travel,
ſometimes by land, ſometimes by water,
through different countries and various
nations, till, at the end of ſix or ſeven
months after I had been kidnapped,
I arrived at the ſea coaſt. It would
be tedious and unintereſting to relate
all the incidents which befell me dur-
ing this journey, and which I have not
yet forgotten; of the various hands I
paſſed through, and the manners and
cuſtoms of all the different people
among whom I lived: I ſhall there-
fore only obſerve, that in all the places
where I was, the ſoil was exceedingly
rich; the pomkins, aedas, plantains,
yams, &c. &c. were in great abund-
ance, and of incredible ſize. There
were alſo vaſt quantities of different
gums, though not uſed for any pur-
poſe; and every where a great deal of
tobacco,


<page 105>

[ 7o J
tobacco. The cotton even grew quite
wild; and there was plenty of red-wood.
I ſaw no mechanics whatever in all
the way, except ſuch as I have men-
tioned. The chief employment in all
theſe countries was agriculture, and
both the males and females, as with us,
were brought up to it, and trained in
the arts of war.
The firſt object which ſaluted my
eyes when I arrived on the coaſt was
the ſea, and a ſlave ſhip, which was
then riding at anchor, and waiting for
its cargo. Theſe filled me with afte-
niſhment, which was ſoon converted
into terror when I was carried on
board. I was immediately handled, and
toſſed up to ſee if I were ſound, by
ſome of the crew; and I was now per-
ſuaded that I had gotten into a world of
bad ſpirits, and that they were going
to kill me. Their complexions too
3 differing

<page 106>

[ 71 || -
differing ſo much from ours, their long
hair, and the language they ſpoke,
(which was very different from any 1.
had ever heard) united to confirm me
in this belief. Indeed ſuch were the
horrors of my views and fears at the
moment, that, if ten thouſand worlds
had been my own, I would have freely
parted with them all to have exchanged
my condition with that of the meaneſt
ſlave in my own country. When I look-
ed round the ſhip too and ſaw a large
furnace or copper boiling, and a mul-
titude of black people of every deſcrip-
tion chained together, every one of
their countenances expreſſing dejection
and ſorrow, I no longer doubted of
my fate; and, quite overpowered with
horror and anguiſh, I fell motionleſs
on the deck and fainted. When I
recovered a little I found ſome black
People about me, who I believed were

T
ſome of thoſe who brought me on
board, and had been receiving their
pay; they talked to me in order to
cheer me, but all in vain. I aſked
them if we were not to be eaten by
thoſe white men with horrible looks,
red faces, and long hair. They told
me I was not ; and one of the crew
brought me a ſmall portion of ſpiritu-
ous liquor in a wine glaſs; but, being
afraid of him, I would not take it out
of his hand. One of the blacks there-
fore took it from him and gave it to
me, and I took a little down my palate,
which, inſtead of reviving me, as they
thought it would, threw me into the
greateſt conſternation at the ſtrange
feeling it produced, having never taſted
any ſuch liquor before. Soon after
this the blacks who brought me on
board went off, and left me abandoned
to deſpair. I now ſaw myſelf deprived
of

[ 73
of all chance of returning to my native
country, or even the leaſt glimpſe of
hope of gaining the ſhore, which I now
conſidered as friendly; and I even
wiſhed for my former ſlavery in pre-
ference to my preſent ſituation, which
was filled with horrors of every kind,
ſtill heightened by my ignorance of
what I was to undergo. I was not
long ſuffered to indulge my grief; I
was ſoon put down under the decks,
and there I received ſuch a ſalutation
in my noſtrils as I had never expe-
rienced in my life: ſo that, with the
loathſomeneſs of the ſtench, and crying
together, I became ſo ſick and low
that I was not able to eat, nor had I
the leaſt deſire to taſte any thing. I
now wiſhed for the laſt friend, death,
to relieve me; but ſoon, to my grief,
two of the white men offered me eat-
ables; and, on my refuſing to eat,

one of them held me faſt by the hands,
and laid me acroſs, I think the windlaſs,
and tied my feet, while the other flogged
me ſeverely. I had never experienced
anything of this kind before; and al-
though not being uſed to the water,
I naturally feared that element the firſt
time I ſaw it, yet nevertheleſs, could
have got over the nettings, I would
have jumped over the fide, but I could
not; and, beſides, the crew uſed to
watch us very cloſely who were not
chained down to the decks, left we
fhould leap into the water: and I have
ſeen ſome of theſe poor African pri-
foners moſt ſeverely cut for attempting
to do ſo, and hourly whipped for not
eating. This indeed was often the caſe
with myſelf. In a little time after,
amongſt the poor chained men, I found
ſome of my own nation, which in a
ſmall degree gave caſe to my mind. I
inquired

<page 110>

| 7; 1
inquired of theſe what was to be done
with us? they gave me to underſtand
we were to be carried to theſe white
people's country to work for them. I
then was a little revived, and thought,
if it were no worſe than working, my
ſituation was not ſo deſperate; but ſtill
I feared I ſhould be put to death, the
white people looked and acted, as I
thought, in ſo ſavage a manner, for
I had never ſeen among any people
ſuch inſtances of brutal cruelty; and
this not only ſhewn towards us blacks,
but alſo to ſome of the whites them-
ſelves. One white man in particular
I ſaw, when we were permitted to be
on deck, flogged ſo unmercifully with
a large rope near the foremaſt, that he
died in conſequence of it; and they
toſſed him over the ſide as they would
have done a brute. This made me
fºr theſe people the more, and I ex

E 2 pe&ted

[ 76
pºsted nothing leſs than to be treated
in the ſame manner. I could not help
expreſſing my fears and apprehenſion,
to ſome of my countrymen: I aſked
them if theſe people had no Country,
but lived in this hollow place (the
ſhip)? they told me they did not, but
came from a diſtant one. Then, ſº
1, how comes it in all our country wº
never heard of them? They told me
becauſe they lived ſo very ſaroff. I then
aſked where were their women? had
they any like themſelves? I was told
they had: ' And why," ſaid I, do we
‘not ſee them * they anſwered, becauſe
they were left behind. I aſked how
the veſſel could go? they told me they
could not tell; but that there were
cloth put upon the maſts by the help
of the ropes I ſaw, and then the veſic
went on, and the white men had ſome
ſpel or magic they put in the water
– - when

<page 112>

| 77 |
when they liked in order to ſtop the
veſſel. I was exceedingly amazed at
this account, and really thought they
were ſpirits. I therefore wiſhed much
to be from amongſt them, for I ex-
pected they would ſacrifice me; but
my wiſhes were vain; for we were ſo
quartered that it was impoſſible for
any of us to make our eſcape. While
we ſtayed on the coaſt I was moſtly on
deck; and one day, to my great aſto-
niſhment, I ſaw one of theſe veſſels
coming in with the ſails up. As ſoon
as the whites ſaw it, they gave a great
ſhout, at which we were amazed; and
the more ſo as the veſſel appeared
larger by approaching nearer. At laſt
ſhe came to an anchor in my fight,
and when the anchor was let go I and
my countrymen who ſaw it were loſt
in aſtoniſhment to obſerve the veſſel
ftop; and were now convinced it W3S

[ 78 |
done by magic. Soon after this the
other ſhip got her boats out, and
they came on board of us, and the
people of both ſhips ſeemed very glad
to ſee each other. Several of the
ſtrangers alſo ſhook hands with us
black people, and made motions with
their hands, fignifying I ſuppoſe, we
were to go to their country; but we
did not underſtand them. At laſt,
when the ſhip we were in, had got
in all her cargo, they made ready with
many fearful noiſes, and we were all
put under deck, ſo that we could not
ſee how they managed the veſſel. But
this diſappointment was the leaſt of
my ſorrow. The ſtench of the hold
while we were on the coaſt was ſo in-
tolerably loathſome, that it was dan-
gerous to remain there for any time,
and ſome of us had been permitted to
ſtay on the deck for the freſh air; but
now that the whole ſhip's cargo were
confined

<page 114>

| 79 |
confined together, it became abſolutely
peſtilential. The cloſeneſs of the place,
and the heat of the climate, added to
the number in the ſhip, which was ſo
erowded that each had ſcarcely room
to turn himſelf, almoſt ſuffocated us.
This produced copious perſpirations,
ſo that the air ſoon became unfit for
reſpiration, from a variety of loath-
ome ſmells, and brought on a ſickneſs
among the ſlaves, of which many died,
thus falling victims to the improvident
avarice, as I may call it, of their pur-
chaſers. This wretched ſituation was
again aggravated by the galling of the
chains, now become inſupportable;
and the filth of the neceſſary tubs, into
which the children often fell, and were
almoſt ſuffocated. The ſhrieks of the
women, and the groans of the dying,
rendered the whole a ſcene of horror
almoſt inconceivable. Happily perhaps
E 4 for

<page 115>

[ 80
for myſelf I was ſoon reduced ſo low
here that it was thought neceſſary to
keep me almoſt always on deck; and
from my extreme youth I was not put
infetters. In this ſituation I expected
every hour to ſhare the fate of my
companions, ſome of whom were al-
moſt daily brought upon deck at the
point of death, which I began to hope
would ſoon put an end to my miſeries.
Often did I think many of the inhabi-
tants of the deep much more happy
than myſelf, I envied them the freedom
they enjoyed, and as often wiſhed I
could change my condition for theirs.
Every circumſtance I met with ſerved
only to render my ſtate more painful,
and heighten my apprehenſions, and
my opinion of the cruelty of the whites.
One day they had taken a number of
fiſhes; and when they had killed and
fatisfied themſelves with as many as
they

<page 116>

[ 81
they thought fit, to our aſtoniſhment
who were on the deck, rather than
give any of them to us tº eat, * we
expected, they toſſed the remaining
fiſh into the ſea again, although we
begged and prayed for ſome as well
as we could, but in vain; and ſome of
my countrymen, being preſſed by hun-
ger, took an opportunity, when they
thought no one ſaw them, of trying to
get alittleprivately; but they were diſ-
covered, and the attempt procured them
ſome very ſevere floggings. One day,
when we had a ſmooth ſea and mode-
rate wind, two of my wearied country-
men who were chained together (I was
nearthematthetime), preferring death
to ſuch a life of miſery, ſomehow made
through the nettings and jumped into
the ſea: immediately another quite de-
jected fellow, who on account of his
illneſs, was ſuffered to be out of irons,
E 5 alſo

<page 117>


I 82 |
alſo followed their example; and Ibe.
lieve many more would very ſoon have
done the ſame if they had not been pre-
vented by the ſhip's crew, who were
inſtantly alarmed. Thoſe of us that
were the moſt active were in a moment
put down under the deck, and there
was ſuch a noiſe and confuſion amongſt
the people of the ſhip as I never heard
before, to ſtop her, and get the boat
out to go after the ſlaves. However
two of the wretches were drowned, but
they got the other, and afterwards
flogged him unmercifully, for thus at-
tempting to prefer death to ſlavery.
In this manner we continued to under-
go more hardſhips than I can now
relate, hardſhips which are inſeparable
from this accurſed trade. Many a
time we were near ſuffocation from the
want of freſh air, which we were often
without for whole days together. This,
and

<page 118>

[ 83. ]
and the ſtench of the neceſſary tubs,
carried off many. During our paſſage
I firſt ſaw flying fiſhes, which ſurpriſed
me very much: they uſed frequently
to fly acroſs the ſhip, and many of
them fell on the deck. I alſo now
firſt ſaw the uſe of the quadrant; I had
often with aſtoniſhment ſeen the mari-
ners make obſervations with it, and 1
could not think what it meant. They
at laſt took notice of my ſurpriſe: and
one of them, willing to increaſe it, as
well as to gratify my curioſity, made me
one day look through it. The clouds
appeared to me to be land, which diſ-
appeared as they paſſed along. This
heightened my wonder; and I was now
more perſuaded than ever that I was
in another world, and that everything
about me was magic. Atlaſt we came
in fight of the iſland of Barbadoes, at
which the whites on board gave a great
E 6 ſhout,

ſhout, and made many ſigns of joy to
us. We did not know what to think
of this; but as the veſſel drew nearer we
plainly ſaw the harbour, and other ſhips
of different kindsand ſizes; and we ſoon
anchored amongſt them off Bridge
Town. Many merchants and planters
now came on board, though it was in
the evening. They put us in ſeparate
parcels, and examined us attentively.
They alſo made us jump, and pointed
to the land, ſignifying we were to go
there. We thought by this we ſhould
be eaten by theſe ugly men, as they ap-
peared to us; and, when ſoon after
we were all put down under the deck
again, there was much dread and trem-
bling among us, and nothing but bitter
cries to be heard all the night from
theſe apprehenſions, inſomuch that at
laſt the white people got ſome old
ſlaves from the land to pacify us. They
told

<page 120>

[ 85 |
told us we were not to be eaten, but
to work, and were ſoon to go on land,
where we ſhould ſee many of our
country people. This report eaſed us
much; and ſure enough, ſoon after
we were landed, there came to us
Africans of all languages. We were
conducted immediately to the mer-
chant's yard, where we were all pent
up together like ſo many ſheep in a
fold, without regard to ſex or age. As
every object was new to me everything
1 ſaw filled me with ſurpriſe. What
ſtruck me firſt was that the houſes were
built with bricksandſtories, and inevery
other reſpect different from thoſe I had
ſeen in Africa: but I was ſtill more aſ-
toniſhed on ſeeing people on horſeback.
I did not know what this could mean:
and indeed I thought theſe people were
full of nothing but magical arts. While
I was in this aſtoniſhment one of my
fellow

<page 121>


I 86
fellow priſoners ſpoke to a countryman
of his about the horſes, who ſaid they
were the ſame kind they had in their
country. I underſtood them, though
they were from a diſtant part of Africa,
and I thought it odd I had not ſeen any
horſes there; but afterwards, when I
came to converſe with different Afri-
eans, I found they had many horſes
amongſt them, and much larger than
thoſe I then ſaw. We were not many
days in the merchant’s cuſtody before
we were ſold after their uſual manner,
which is this:–On a ſignal given, (as
the beat of a drum) the buyers ruſh
at once into the yard where the ſlaves
are confined, and make choice of that
parcel they like beſt. The noiſe and
clamour with which this is attended,
and the eagerneſs viſible in the coun-
tenances of the buyers, ſerve not a little
to increaſe the apprehenſion of the

[ 90
ways, and I never ſaw one of them:
afterwards.
I ſtayed in this iſland for a few days;
I believe it could not be above a fort-
night; when I and ſome few more
ſlaves, that were not ſaleable amongſt
the reſt, from very much fretting,
were ſhipped off in a ſloop for North
America. On the paſſage we were
better treated than when we were com-
ing from Africa, and we had plenty of
rice and fat pork. We were landed
up a river a good way from the ſea,
about Virginia county, where we ſaw
few or none of our native Africans,
and not one ſoul who could talk to me.
I was a few weeks weeding graſs, and
gathering ſtones in a plantation; and
at laſt all my companions were diſtri-
buted different ways, and only myſelf
was left. I was now exceedingly mi-

ſerable, and thought myſelf worſe of
than

[ 91
than any of the reſt of my companions;
for they could talk to each other, but
I had no perſon to ſpeak to that I could
underſtand. In this ſtate I was conſtantly
grieving and pining, and wiſhing for
death rather than any thing elſe.
While I was in this plantation the
gentleman, to whom Iſuppoſethe eſtate
belonged, being unwell, I was one day
ſent for to his dwelling houſe to fan
him; when I came into the room where
he was I was very much affrighted at
ſome things I ſaw, and the more ſo
as I had ſeen a black woman ſlave as I
came through the houſe, who was
cooking the dinner, and the poor crea-
ture was cruelly loaded with various
kinds of iron machines; ſhe had one
particularly on her head, which locked
hermouth ſo faſt that ſhe could ſcarcely
ſpeak; and could not eat nor drink.
was much aſtoniſhed and ſhocked at
this

<page 127>

[ 92 J
this contrivance, which I afterwards
learned was called the iron muzzle.
Soon after I had a fan put into my
hand, to fan the gentleman while he
ſlept; and ſo I did indeed with great
fear. While he was faſt aſleep I in-
dulged myſelf a great deal in looking
about the room, which to me appeared
very fine and curious. The firſt object
that engaged my attention was a watch
which hung on the chimney, and was
going. I was quite ſurpriſed at the
noiſe it made, and was afraid it would
tell the gentleman anything I might do
amiſs: and when I immediately after
obſerved apicture hanging in the room,
which appeared conſtantly to look at
me, I was ſtill more affrighted, having
never ſeen ſuch things as theſe before.
Atone time I thought it was ſomething
relative to magic; and not ſeeing it

the whites had to keep their great men
when they died, and offer them liba-
tions as we uſed to do to our friendly
ſpirits. In this ſtate of anxiety I re-
mained till my maſter awoke, when I
was diſmiſſed out of the room, to my
no ſmall ſatisfaction and relief; for I
thought that theſe people were all made
up of wonders. In this place I was
called Jacob, but on board the African
ſnow I was called Michael. I had been
formetime in this miſerable, forlorn, and
much dejected ſtate, without having any
one to talk to, which made my life a
burden, when the kind and unknown
hand of the Creator (who in very deed
leads the blind in away they know not)
now began to appear, to my comfort;
for one day the captain of a merchant
fhip, called the Induſtrious Bee, came
on ſome buſineſs to my maſter's houſe.
This gentleman, whoſe name was Mi-
chael


<page 129>

94
chael Henry Paſcal, was a lieutenant
in the royal navy, but now commanded
this trading ſhip, which was ſome-
where in the confines of the county
many miles off. While he was at my
maſter's houſe it happened that he ſaw
me, and liked me ſo well that he made
a purchaſe of me. I think I have
often heard him ſay he gave thirty of
forty pounds ſterling for me; but I do
not now remember which. However, he
meant me for a preſent to ſome of his
friends in England: and I was ſent
accordingly from the houſe of my then
maſter, (one Mr. Campbell) to the
place where the ſhip lay; I was con-
dućted on horſeback by an elderly
black man, (a mode of travelling
which appeared very odd to me).
When I arrived I was carried on board
a fine large ſhip, loaded with tobacco,
&c. and juſt ready to ſail for England.
I now

<page 130>

95
* now thought my condition much
mended; I had ſails to lie on, and
plenty of good victuals to eat; and
every body on board uſed me very
kindly, quite contrary to what I had
ſeen of any white people before; I
therefore began to think that they were
not all of the ſame diſpoſition. A few
days after I was on board we ſailed
for England. I was ſtill at a loſs to
conjecture my deſtiny. By this time,
however, I could ſmatter a little im–
perfect Engliſh; and I wanted to
know as well as I could where we
were going. Some of the people of
the ſhip uſed to tell me they were go-
ing to carry me back tomy own coun-
try, and this made me very happy. I
was quite rejoiced at the idea of going
back; and thought if I ſhould get
home what wonders I ſhould have to
tell. But I was reſerved for another
2 fate,

<page 131>


[ 96 ||
fate, and was ſoon undeceived when
we came within fight of the Engliſh
coaſt. While I was on board this ſhip,
my captain and maſter named me
Guſtavas Paſº. I at that time began to
underſtand him a little, and refuſed to
be called ſo, and told him as well as I
could that I would be called Jacob:
but he ſaid I ſhould not, and ſtill
called me Guſtavus: and when I re-
fuſed to anſwer to my new name,
which at firſt I did, it gained me many
a cuff; ſo at length ſubmitted, and
by which I have been known ever
ſince. The ſhip had a very long paſ-
ſage; and on that account we had very
ſhort allowance of proviſions. Towards
the laſt we had only one pound and a
half of bread per week, and about the
ſame quantity of meat, and one quart
of water a-day. We ſpoke with only
one veſſel the whole time we were
at

<page 132>

ſ 97
at ſea, and but once we caught a few
fiſhes. In our extremities the captain
and people told me injeſt they would
kill and eat me; but I thought them
in earneſt, and was depreſſed beyond
meaſure, expecting every moment to
be my laſt. While I was in this ſitu-
ation one evening they caught, with
a good deal of trouble, a large ſhark,
and got it on board. This glad-
dened my poor heart exceedingly, as I
thought it would ſerve the people to
eat inſtead of their eating me; but
very ſoon, to my aſtoniſhment, they
cut off a ſmall part of the tail, and
toſſed the reſt over the ſide. This
renewed my conſternation; and I did
not know what to think of theſe white
people, though I very much feared
they would kill and eat me. There
was on board the ſhip a young lad who
had never been at ſea before, about

his name was Richard Baker. He was
a native of America, had received an ex-
cellent education, and was of a moſt
amiable temper. Soon after I went on
board he ſhewed me a great deal of
partiality and attention, and in return
I grew extremely fond of him. We
at length became inſeparable; and,
for the ſpace of two years, he was of
very great uſe to me, and was my
conſtant companion and inſtructor.
Although this dear youth had many
ſlaves of his own, yet he and I have
gone through many ſufferings together
on ſhipboard; and we have many
nights lain in each other's boſoms when
we were in great diſtreſs. Thus ſuch
a friendſhip was cemented between us
as we cheriſhed till his death, which,
to my very great ſorrow, happened in
the year 1759, when he was up the
Archipelago,

<page 134>

99 |
Archipelago, on board his majeſty's
ſhip the Preſton: an event which I
have never ceaſed to regret, as I loſt
at once a kind interpreter, an agreeable
companion, and a faithful friend;
who, at the age of fifteen, diſcovered
a mind ſuperior to prejudice; and who
was not aſhamed to notice, to aſſociate
with, and to be the friendandinſtructor
of one who was ignorant, a ſtranger, of
a different complexion, and a ſlave!
My maſter had lodged in his mother's
houſe in America: he reſpected him
very much, and made him always eat
with him in the cabin. He uſed often
to tell him jocularly that he would
kill and eat me. Sometimes he would
ſay to me—the black people were not
good to eat, and would aſk me if we
did not eat people in my country. I
ſaid, No: then he ſaid he would kill

and afterwards me. Though this hear.
ing relieved my mind a little as to
myſelf, I was alarmed for Dick, and
whenever he was called I uſed to be
very much afraid he was to be killed;
and I would peep and watch to ſee if
they were going to kill him: nor was I
free from this conſternation till we
made the land. One night we loſta
man overboard; and the cries and
noiſe were ſo great and confuſed, in
ſtopping the ſhip, that I, who did not
know what was the matter, began, as -
uſual, to be very much afraid, and to
think they were going to make an of
fering with me, and perform ſome
magic; which I ſtill believed they deal:
in. As the waves were very high I
thought the Ruler of the ſeas was an-
gry, and I expected to be offered up
to appeaſe him. This filled my mind
with agony, and I could not any more

<page 136>

| Io; i.
that night cloſe my eyes again to reſt.
However, when daylight appeared
was a little eaſed in my mind; but
ſtill every time I was called ! uſed to
think it was to be killed. Some time
after this we ſaw ſome very large fiſh,
which I afterwards found were called
grampuſes. They looked to me ex-
tremely terrible, and made their ap-
pearance juſt at duſk; and were ſo
near as to blow the water on the ſhip's
deck. I believed them to be the
rulers of the ſeaſ; and as the white
people did not make any offerings at
any time, I thought they were angry
with them: and, at laſt, what con-
firmed my belief was, the wind juſt
then died away, and a calm enſued, and
in conſequence of it the ſhip ſtopped
going. I ſuppoſed that the fiſh had per-
formed this, and I hid myſelf in the
fore part of the ſhip, through fear of be-
- F 3 ing

[ Ioz }
ing offered up to appeaſe them, every
minute peeping and quaking: but my
good friend Dick came ſhortly towards
me, and I took an opportunity to aſk
him, as well as I could, what theſe
fiſh were. Not being able to talk
much Engliſh, I could but juſt make
him underſtand my queſtion; and not
at all, when I aſked him if any offer-
ings were to be made to them: how-
ever, he told me theſe fiſh would
ſwallow any body, which ſufficiently
alarmed me. Here he was called away
by the captain, who was leaning over
the quarter-deck railing and looking
at the fiſh; and moſt of the people
were buſied in getting a barrel of pitch
to light, for them to play with. The
captain now called me to him, having
learned ſome of my apprehenſions from
Dick; and having diverted himſelf and
others for ſome time with my fears,
which

which appeared ludicrous enough in
my crying and trembling, he diſmiſſed
me. The barrel of pitch was now

water: by this time it was juſt dark,
and the fiſh went after it; and, to my
great joy, I ſaw them no more.
However, all my alarms began to
ſubſide when we got fight of land; and
at laſt the ſhip arrived at Falmouth, af-
ter a paſſage of thirteen weeks. Every
heart on board ſeemed gladdened on
our reaching the ſhore, and none more
than mine. The captain immediately
went on ſhore, and ſent on board ſome
freſh proviſions, which we wanted very
much: we made good uſe of them, and
our famine was ſoon turned into feaſt-
ing, almoſt without ending. It was
about the beginning of the ſpring

I was near twelve years of age at that

time. I was very much ſtruck with
the buildings and the pavement of h
ſtreets in Falmouth; and, indeed, every
object I ſaw filled me with new ſur-
priſe. One morning, when I got upon
deek, I ſaw it covered all over with the
ſnow that ſell over-night: as I had
never ſeen anything of the kind before,
I thought it was ſalt; ſo I immediately
ran down to the mate and deſired him,
as well as I could, to come and ſee
how ſomebody in the night had thrown
ſalt all over the deck. He, knowing
what it was, deſired me to bring ſome
of it downto him: accordingly I took
up a handful of it, which I found very
cold indeed; and when I brought it tº
him he deſired me to taſte it. I did
ſo, and I was ſurpriſed beyond mea-
ſure. I then aſked him what it was:
he told me it was ſhow; but I could
not in anywiſe underſtand him. He

at a loſs to underſtand him; and the
more ſo, when a little after I ſaw the
air filled with it, in a heavy ſhower,
which fell down on the ſame day.
After this I went to church; and
having never been at ſuch a place
before, I was again amazed at ſeeing
and hearing the ſervice. I aſked an I.

However, my littlefriend Dick uſed to,

be my beſt interpreter; for I could
make free with him, and he always in-
ſtructed me with pleaſure: and from
what I could underſtand by him of this
God, and in ſeeing theſe white people
did not ſell one another as we did, I
was much pleaſed; and in this I thought
they were much happier than we Afri-
cans. I was aſtoniſhed at the wiſdom
of the white people in all things I ſaw ;
but was amazed at their not ſacrificing,
or making any offerings, and eating
with unwaſhed hands, and touching the
dead. I likewiſe could not help re-
marking the particular ſlenderneſs of
their women, which I did not at firſt
like; and I thought they were not ſo
modeſt and ſhamefaced as the African
Women.
I had often ſeen my maſter and Dick
employed in reading; and I had a
great curioſity to talk to the books, as
I thought

<page 142>

[ 107 |
I thought they did; and ſo to learn
how all things had a beginning; for
that purpoſe I have often taken up a
book, and have talked to it, and then
put my ears to it, when alone, in hopes
it would anſwer me; and I have been
very much concerned when I found it
remained ſilent.
My maſter lodged at the houſe of a
gentleman in Falmouth, who had a fine
little daughter about ſix or ſeven years
of age, and ſhe grew prodigiouſly fond
of me; inſomuch that we uſed to
eat together, and had ſervants to wait
on us. I was ſo much careſſed by this
family that it often reminded me of
the treatment I had received from my
little noble African maſter. After I
had been herea few days, I was ſent on
board of the ſhip; but the child cried
ſo much after me that nothing could
Pacify her till I was ſent for again.
F 6 It

<page 143>
| Ios I
It is ludicrous enough, that I began
to fear I ſhould be betrothed to this
young lady; and when my maſter
aſked me if I would ſtay there with her
behind him, as he was going away
with the ſhip, which had taken in the
tobacco again, I cried immediately,
and ſaid I would not leave him. At
laſt, by ſtealth, one night I was ſent on
board the ſhip again; and in a little
time we ſailed for Guernſey, where ſhe
was in part owned by a merchant, one
Nicholas Doberry. As I was now
amongſt a people who had not their
faces ſcarred, like ſome of the African
nations where I had been, I was very
glad I did not let them ornament me
in that manner when I was with them.
When we arrived at Guernſey, my
maſter placed me to board and lodge
with one of his mates, who had a wife
and familythere; and ſome months after-

wards he went to England, and left me:
in care of this mate, together with my
friend Dick: This mate had a little
daughter, aged about five or ſix years,
with whom I uſed to be much de-
lighted. I had often obſerved that
when her mother waſhed her face it
looked very roſy, but when ſhe waſhed
mine it did not look ſo; I therefore
tried oftentimes myſelf if I could not by
waſhing make my face of the ſame co-
lour as my little play-mate (Mary), but
it was all in vain; and Inow began to be
mortified at the difference in our com-
plexions. This woman behaved to me
with great kindneſs and attention; and
taught me cvery thing in the ſame
manner as ſhe did her own child, and
indeed in every reſpect treated me as
ſuch. I remained here till the ſum-
mer of the year. 1757; when my
maſter, being appointed firſt lieu-
tenant:

tenant of his majeſty's ſhip the Roc-
buck, ſent for Dick and me, and
his old mate: on this we all left
Guernſey, and ſet out for England
in a ſloop bound for London. As we
were coming up towards the Nore,
where the Roebuck lay, a man of war's
boat came alongſide to preſs our peo-
ple; on which each man ran to hide
himſelf. I was very much frightened
at this, though I did not know what it
meant, or what to think or do. How-
ever I went and hid myſelf alſo under a
hencoop. Immediately afterwards the
preſs-gang came on board with their
ſwords drawn, and ſearched all about,
pulled the people out by force, and put
them into the boat. At laſt I was found
out alſo ; the man that found me held
me up by the heels while they all made
their ſport of me, I roaring and crying
out all the time moſt luſtily; but at
- laſt

<page 146>

[ 111 ||
laſt the mate, who was my conductor,
ſeeing this, came to my aſſiſtance, and
did all he could to pacify me; but all
to very little purpoſe, till I had ſeen the
boat go off. Soon afterwards we came
to the Nore, where the Roebucklay;
and, to our great joy, my maſter came
on board to us, and brought us to the
ſhip. When I went on board this
large ſhip, I was amazed indeed to ſee
the quantity of men and the guns.
However my ſurpriſe began to diminiſh
as my knowledge increaſed; and I
ceaſed to feel thoſe apprehenſions and
alarms which had taken ſuch ſtrong
poſſeſſion of me when I firſt came
among the Europeans, and for ſome
time after. Ibegan now to paſs to an op-
poſite extreme; I was ſo far from being
afraidofany thing new which Iſaw,that,
after I had been ſome time in thisſhip, I
even began to long for an engagement.
My

<page 147>


[ 112 |
My griefs too, which in young minds
are not perpetual, were now wearing
away; and I ſoon enjoyed myſelf pretty
well, and felt tolerably eaſy in my pre-
ſent ſituation. There was a number
of boys on board, which ſtill made it
more agreeable; for we were always
together, and a great part of our time
was ſpent in play. I remained in this
ſhip a conſiderable time, during which
we made ſeveral cruiſes, and viſited a
variety of places: among others we
were twice in Holland, and brought
over ſeveral perſons of diſtinction from
it, whoſe names I do not now remem-
ber. On the paſſage, one day, for the
diverſion of thoſe gentlemen, all the
boys were called on the quarter deck,
and were paired proportionably, and
then made to fight; after which the
gentlemen gave the combatants from
five to nine ſhillings each. This was
the

<page 148>

[ 113 ||
the firſt time I ever fought with a white
boy; and I never knew what it was to:
have a bloody noſe before. This made
me fight moſt deſperately; I ſuppoſe
confiderably more than an hour; and
at laſt, both of us being weary, we
were parted. I had a great deal of this
kind of ſport afterwards, in which the
captain and the ſhip's company uſed
very much to encourage me. Some-
time afterwards the ſhip wentto Leithin
Scotland, and from thence to the Ork-
neys, where I was ſurpriſed in ſeeing
ſcarcely any night: and from thence we
failed with a great fleet, full of ſoldiers,
for England. All this time we had
never come to an engagement, though
we were frequently cruiſing off the
coaſt of France: during which we
chaſed many veſſels, and took in all
ſeventeen prizes. I had been learning
many of the manoeuvres of the ſhip
during

<page 149>

[ 114
during our cruiſe; and I was ſeveral
times made to fire the guns. One even-
ing, off Havre de Grace, juſt as it
was growing dark, we were ſtanding
off ſhore, and met with a fine large
French-built frigate. We got all things
immediately ready for fighting; and I
now expected I ſhould be gratified in
feeing an engagement, which I had ſo
long wiſhed for in vain. But the very
moment the word of command was
given to fire, we heard thoſe on board
the other ſhip cry Hauldown the jib;
and in that inſtant ſhe hoiſted Engliſh
colours. There was inſtantly with usan
amazing cry of ‘Avaſt!” or ſtop firing:
and I think one or two guns had been
let off, but happily they did no miſ-
chief. We had hailed them ſeveral
times; but they not hearing, we re-
ceived no anſwer, which was the cauſe

of our firing. The boat was then ſent

on board of her, and ſhe proved to be
the Ambuſcademan of war, to my no-
ſmall diſappointment. We returned to
Portſmouth, without having been in
any action, juſt at the trial of Admiral
Byng (whom I ſaw ſeveral times dur-
ing it); and my maſter having left the
fhip, and gone to London for promo-
tion, Dick and I were put on board the
Savage ſloop of war, and we went in
her to aſſiſt in bringing off the St.
George man of war, that hadran aſhore
ſomewhere on the coaſt. After ſtaying
a few weeks onboard the Savage, Dick
and I were ſent on ſhore at Deal, where
we remained ſome ſhort time, till my
maſter ſent for us to London, the place
I had long deſired exceedingly to ſee.
We therefore both with great pleaſure
got into a waggon, and came to Lon-
don, where we were received by a Mr.
Guerin, a relation of my maſter. This
gentleman

<page 151>

[ 116 F.
gentleman had two ſiſters, very ami-
able ladies, who took much notice and
great care of me. Though I had de-
fired ſo much to ſee London, when I
arrived in it I was unfortunately unable
to gratify my curioſity; for I had at
this time the chilblains to ſuch a de-
gree that I could not ſtand for ſeveral
months, and 1 was obliged to be ſent
to St. George's Hoſpital. There I
grew ſo ill, that the doctors wanted to
cut my left leg off at different times,
apprehending a mortification; but I
always ſaid I would rather die than ſuf-
fer it; and happily (I thank God)
recovered without the operation. After
being there ſeveral weeks, and juſt as I
had recovered, the ſmallpox brokeout
on me, ſo that I was again confined;
and I thought myſelf now particularly
unfortunate. However I ſoon reco-
wered again; and by this time my

maſter having been promoted to be firſt
lieutenant of the Preſton man of war
of fifty guns, then new at Deptford,
Dick and I were ſent on board her,
and ſoon after we went to Holland to
bring over the late Duke of
to England.—While I was in this ſhip
an incident happened, which, though
trifling, I beg leave to relate, as I could
not help taking particular notice of it,
and conſideringit then as a judgmentof
God. One morning a young man was
looking up to the fore-top, and in a
wicked tone, common on ſhipboard,
d—d his eyes about ſomething. Juſt
at the moment ſome ſmall particles
of dirt fell into his left eye, and by
the evening it was very much inflamed.
The next day it grew worſe; and within
fix or ſeven days he loſt it. From
this ſhip, my maſter was appointed a
lieutenant on board the Royal George.
When

<page 153>
[ ſ 18 J
When he was going he wiſhed me to
ſtay on board the Preſton, to learn the
French horn; but the ſhip being or-
dered for Turkey I could not think of
leaving my maſter, to whom I was
very warmly attached; and I told him
if he left me behind it would break
my heart. This prevailed on him to
take me with him; but he left Dick on
board the Preſton, whom I embraced
at parting for the laſt time. The Royal
George was the largeſt ſhip I had ever
ſeen; ſo that when I came on board of
her I was ſurpriſed at the number of
people, men, women, and children, of
every denomination; and the largeneſs
of the guns, many of them alſo of braſs,
which I had never ſeen before. Here
were alſo ſhops or ſtalls of every kind
of goods, and people crying their dif-
ferent commodities about the ſhip as in
a town. To me it appeared a little
world,


<page 154>

F 119 |
world, into which I was again caſt with
out a friend, for I had no longer my
dear companion Dick. We did not
ſtay long here. My maſter was not
many weeks on board before he got an
appointment to be ſixth lieutenant of
the Namur, which was then at Spit-
head, fitting up for Vice-admiral Boſca-
wen, who was going with a large fleet
on an expedition againſt Louiſburgh.
The crew of the Royal George were
turned over to her, and the flag of
that gallant admiral was hoſted on
board, the blue at the maintopgallant
maſt head. There was a very great
fleet of men of war of every deſcrip-
tion aſſembled together for this expe-
dition, and I was in hopes ſoon to have
an opportunity of being gratified with
a ſea-fight. All things being now in
readineſs, this mighty fleet (for there
was alſo Admiral Corniſh’s fleetincom-
pany,

<page 155>
[ 16 J
pany, deſtined for the Eaſt Indies) at
laſt weighed anchor, and ſailed. The
two fleets continued in company for
ſeveral days, and then parted; Admiral
Corniſh, in the Lenox, having firſt ſa-
luted our admiral in the Namur, which
he returned. We then ſteered for
America; but, by contrary winds, we
were driven to Teneriffe, where I was
ſtruck with its noted peak. Its prodi-
gious height, and its form, reſembling
a ſugar loaf, filled me with wonde,
We remained in fight of this iſland
ſome days, and then proceeded for
America, which we ſoon made, and
got into a very commodious harbour
called St. George, in Halifax, where
we had fiſh in great plenty, and all
other freſh proviſions. We were here
joined by different men of war and
tranſport ſhips with ſoldiers; after
which, our fleet being increaſed to a

prodigious number of ſhips of all
kinds, we ſailed for Cape Breton in
Nova Scotia. We had the good and
gallant General Wolfe on board our
ſhip, whoſe affability made him highly
eſteemed and beloved by all the men.
He often honoured me, as well as other
boys, with marks of his notice; and
ſaved me once a flogging for fighting
with a young gentleman. We arrived
at Cape Breton in the ſummer of 1758:
and here the ſoldiers were to be landed,
in order to make an attack upon Louiſ-
tº bourgh. My maſter had ſome part in
mº ſuperintending the landing; and here I
sº was in a ſmall meaſure gratified in ſee-
ñº,

troops purſued them as far as the town
of Louiſbourgh. In this action many
were killed on both ſides. One thing
remarkable I ſaw this day:—A lieute-
nantofthe Princeſs Amelia, who, as well
as my maſter,ſuperintended the landing,
was giving the word of command, and
while his mouth was open a muſquet
ball went through it, and paſſed out at
his check. I had that day in my hand
the ſcalp of an indian king, who was
killed in the engagement: the ſcalp
had been taken off by an Highlander.
I ſaw this king's ornaments too, which
were very curious, and made of fea-
thers.
Our land forces laid ſiege to the town
of Louiſbourgh, while the French men
of war were blocked up in the harbour
by the fieet, the batteries at the ſame
time playing upon them from the land.
This they did with ſuch effect, that one
day

<page 158>

| 123
day I ſaw ſome of the ſhips ſº on fire
by the thells from the batteries, and I
believe two or three of them were quite
burnt. At another time, about fifty
boats belonging to the Engliſh men of
war, commanded by Captain George
Belfour of the AEtna fire ſhip, and Mr.
Laforey another junior captain, attack-
ed and boarded the only two remaining
French men of war in the harbour. They
alſo ſet fire to a ſeventy-gun ſhip, but a
fixty-four, called the Bienfaiſant, they
brought off. During my ſtay here I had
often an opportunity of being near cap-
tain Belfour, who was pleaſed to notice
me, and liked me ſo much that he
often aſked my maſter to let him
have me, but he would not part with
me; and no conſideration could have
induced me to leave him. At laſt
Louiſbourgh was taken, and the Eng-
liſh men of war came into the harbour

before it, to my very great joy; for I
had now more liberty of indulging my-
ſelf, and I went often on ſhore. When
the ſhips were in the harbour we had
the moſt beautiful proceſſion on the
water I ever ſaw. All the admirals and
captains of the men of war, full dreſſed,
and in their barges, well ornamented
with pendants, came alongſide of the
Namur. The vice-admiral then went
on ſhore in his barge, followed by the
other officers in order of ſeniority, to
take poſſeſſion, as I ſuppoſe, of the
town and fort. Some time after this
the French governor and his lady, and
other perſons of note, came on board
our ſhip to dine. On this occaſion
our ſhips were dreſſed with colours
of all kinds, from the topgallant-maſt
head to the deck; and this, with the
firing of guns, formed a moſt grand

and magnificent ſpectacle,
As

<page 160>
[ 125 |
As ſoon as every thing here was
ſettled, Admiral Boſcawen ſailed with
part of the fleet for England, leaving
ſome ſhips behind with Rear admirals
Sir Charles Hardy and Durell. It was
now winter; and one evening, during
our paſſage home, about duſk, when
we were in the channel, or near found-
ings, and were beginning to look for
land, we deſcried ſeven fail of large
men of war, which ſtood off ſhore.
Several people on board of our ſhip
ſaid, as the two fleets were (in forty
minutes from the firſt fight) within hail
of each other, that they were Engliſh
men of war; and ſome of our people
even began to name ſome of the ſhips.
By this time both fleets began to min-
gle, and our admiral ordered his flag
to be hoiſted. At that inſtant the other
fleet, which were French, hoiſted their
enſigns, and gave us a broadſide as they

of the French ſhips. However, the
Royal William and the Somerſet, being
our ſternmoſt ſhips, became a little pre-
pared, and each gave the French ſhips a
broadſide as they paſſed by. I after-
wards heard this was a French ſqua-
dron, commanded by Monſ. Conflans;
and certainly had the Frenchmen known
our condition, and had a mind to fight
us, they might have done us great
miſchief. But we were not long before

ing now in readineſs for fighting, we
wore ſhip, and ſtood after the French
fleet, who were one or two ſhips in
number more than we. However we
gave them chaſe, and continued purſu-
ing them all night; and at day-light
we ſaw fix of them, all large ſhips of
the line, and an Engliſh Eaſt Indiaman,
a prize they had taken. We chaſed
them all daytill between three and four
o'clock in the evening, when we came
up with, and paſſed within a muſquet
ſhot of one ſeventy-four gun ſhip, and
the Indiaman alſo, who now hoiſted her
colours, but immediately hauled them
down again. On this we made a ſig-
nal for the other ſhips to take poſſeſſion
of her; and, ſuppoſing the man of war
would likewiſe ſtrike, we cheered, but
ſhe did not; though if we had fired
into her, from being ſo near, we muſt
have taken her. To my utter ſurpriſe,

the Somerſet, who was the next ſhip
a-ſtern of the Namur, made way like-
wife; and, thinking they were ſure of
this French ſhip, they cheered in the
ſame manner, but ſtill continued to
follow us. The French Commodore
was about a gun-ſhot ahead of all, run-
ning from us with all ſpeed; and about
four o'clock he carried his foretop-
maſt overboard. This cauſed another
loud cheer with us; and a little after
the topmaſt came cloſe by us; but, to
our great ſurpriſe, inſtead of coming
up with her, we found ſhe went as faſt
as ever, if not faſter. The ſea grew
now much ſmoother; and the wind

but the next day we were out of fight,
ſo that we ſaw no more of them;
and we only had the old Indiaman
(called Carnarvon I think) for our
trouble. After this we ſtood in for
the channel, and ſoon made the land;
and, about the cloſe of the year
1758–9, we got ſafe to St. Helen's.

but, by ſtarting our water, and toſſing
many things overboard to lighten
her, we got the ſhips off without
any damage. We ſtayed for a ſhort
time at Spithead, and then went into
Portſmouth harbour to refit: from
whence the admiral went to London,
and my maſter and I ſoon followed,
with a preſs-gang, as we wanted ſome
hands to complete our complement.

beheld on ſhip-board, I ſoon grew a
ſtranger to terror of every kind, and
was, in that reſpect at leaſt, almoſt an
Engliſhman. I have often reflected
with ſurpriſe that I never felt half the
alarm at any of the numerous dangers
I have been in, that I was filled with
at the firſt fight of the Europeans, and
at every act of theirs, even the moſt
trifling, when I firſt came among them,
and for ſome time afterwards. That
fear, however, which was the effect of
my ignorance, wore away as I began
to know them. I could now ſpeak
Engliſh tolerably well, and I perfectly
underſtood every thing that was ſaid.
I not only felt myſelf quite eaſy with

longer looked upon them as ſpirits,

and imitate their manners; I therefore
embraced every occaſion of improve-
ment; and every new thing that I ob-
ſerved I treaſured up in my memory-
I had long wiſhed to be able to read
and write; and for this purpoſe I took
every opportunity to gain iuſtruction,
but had made as yet very little pro-
greſs. However, when I went to
London with my maſter, I had ſoon
an opportunity of improving myſelf,
which Igladly embraced. Shortly after
my arrival, he ſent me to wait upon
the Miſs Guerins, who had treated me
with much kindneſs when I was there
before; and they ſent me to ſchool.
While I was attending theſe ladies,
their ſervants told me I could not go
to Heaven, unleſs I was baptized.
This made me very uneaſy; for I had
now ſome faint idea of a future ſtate:
accordingly

<page 169>

I 134
accordingly Icommunicated myanxiety
to the eldeſt Miſs Guerin, with whom
I was become a favourite, and preſſed
her to have me baptized; when to my
great joy, ſhe told me I ſhould. She had
formerly aſked my maſter to let me be
baptized, but he had refuſed; however
ſhe now inſiſted on it; and he being
under ſome obligation to her brother
complied with her requeſt; ſo I was
baptized in St. Margaret's church,
Weſtminſter, in February 1759, by my
preſent name. The clergyman at the
ſame time, gave me a book, called a
Guide to the Indians, written by the
Biſhop of Sodor and Man. On this
occaſion, Miſs Guerin did me the ho-
nour to ſtand as godmother, and after-
wards gave me a treat. I uſed to at-
tend theſe ladies about the town, in
which ſervice I was extremely happy;
as I had thus many opportunities of

feeing London, which I deſired of all
things. I was ſometimes, however,
with my maſter at his rendezvous-
houſe, which was at the foot of Weſt-
minſter-bridge. Here I uſed to enjoy
myſelf in playing about the bridge

watermen who providentially came to
my relief. º
The Namur being again got ready
for ſea, my maſter, with his gang, was
ordered on board, and, to my no ſmall
grief, I was obliged to leave my ſchool-
maſter, whom I liked very much, and
always attended while I ſtayed in Lon-
don, to repair on board with my
maſter. Nor did I leave my kind pa.
troneſſes, the Miſs Guerins, without
uneaſineſs and regret. They often
uſed to teach me to read, and took
great pains to inſtruct me in the prin-
ciples of religion and the knowledge of
God. I therefore parted from thoſe
amiable ladies with reluctance: after
receiving from them many friendly
cautions how to conduct myſelf, and
ſome valuable preſents.
When I came to Spithead, I found
we were deſtined for the Mediterra-
Intall,

nean, with a large fleet, which was now
ready to put to ſea. We only waited
for the arrival of the admiral, who ſoon
came on board; and about the begin-
ning of the ſpring 759, having weigh-
ed anchor, and got under way, ſailed
for the Mediterranean ; and in eleven
days, from the Land's End, we got
to Gibraltar. While we were here
I uſed to be often on ſhore, and got
various fruits in great plenty, and
very cheap.
I had frequently told ſeveral people,
in my excurſions on ſhore, the ſtory of
my being kidnapped with my ſiſter, and
of our being ſeparated, as I have related
before; and I had as often expreſſed
my anxiety for her fate, and my ſorrow
at having never mether again. One
day, when I was on ſhore, and men-
tioning theſe circumſtances to ſome
Perſons, one of them told me he knew
where

<page 173>


[ 138 j
where my fifter was, and, if I would
accompany him, he would bring me to
her. Improbable as this ſtory was, I
believed it immediately, and agreed to
go with him, while my heart leaped for
joy; and, indeed, he conducted me to
a black young woman, who was ſo like
my ſiſter, that at firſt fight, I really
thought it was her: but I was quickly
undeceived; and, on talking to her, I
found her to be of another nation.
While we lay here the Preſton came
in from the Levant. As ſoon as ſhe
arrived, my maſter told me I ſhould
now ſee my old companion, Dick,
who was gone in her when ſhe ſailed
for Turkey. I was much rejoiced at
this news, and expected every minute
to embrace him; and when the cap-
tain came on board of our ſhip, which
he did immediately after, I ran to in-
quire after my friend; but, with inex-
preſſible

<page 174>

[ 139
preſſible ſorrow, I learned from the
boat's crew that the dear youth was
dead! and that they had brought his

of my friend, whom Iloved, and grieved
for, as a brother.
While we were at Gibralter, I ſaw a
ſoldier hanging by the heels, at one of
the moles": I thought this a ſtrange
fight, as I had ſeen a man hanged in
London by his neck. At another time I
ſaw themaſterofafrigate towed to ſhore
on a grating, by ſeveral of the men of
war's boats, and diſcharged the fleet,
which I underſtood was a mark of diſ-
grace for cowardice. On board the

time, we ſailed up the Mediterranean
a confiderable way above the Gulf
of Lyons; where we were one night
overtaken with a terrible gale of wind,
much greater than any I had ever yet
experienced. The ſea ranſohigh that,
though all the guns were well houſed,
there was great reaſon to fear their
getting looſe, the ſhip rolled ſo much;
and if they had it muſt have proved
our deſtruction. After we had cruiſed
here for a ſhort time, we came to Bar-
celona, a Spaniſh ſea-port, remarkable
for its ſilk manufactures. Here the
ſhips were all to be watered; and my
maſter, who ſpoke different languages,
and uſed often to interpret for the ad-
miral, ſuperintended the watering of
ours. For that purpoſe he and the
officers of the other ſhips, who were
on the ſame ſervice, had tents pitched
in the bay; and the Spaniſh ſoldiers
were ſtationed along the ſhore, I ſup-
poſe

<page 176>

141
poſe to ſee that no depredations were
committed by our men.
I uſed conſtantly to attend my maſ-
ter; and I was charmed with this
place. All the time we ſtayed it was
like a fair with the natives, who brought
us fruits of all kinds, and ſold them to
us much cheaper than I got them in
England. They uſed alſo to bring
wine down to us in hog and ſheep
ſkins, which diverted me very much.
The Spaniſh officers here treated our
officers with great politeneſs and atten-
tion; and ſome of them, in particular,
uſed to come often to my maſter's tent
to viſit him; where they would ſome-
times divertthemſelves by mounting me
on the horſes or mules, ſo that I could
notfall, and ſetting them offat full gal-
lop; my imperfectſkillinhorſemanſhip
all the while affording them no ſmall
entertainment. After the ſhips were
watered,

<page 177>
142
watered, we returned to our old ſta-
tion of cruizing off Toulon, for the
purpoſeof interceptinga fleet of French
men of war that lay there. One Sun-
day, in our cruiſe, we came off a place
where there were two ſmall French fri-
gates lying in ſhore; and our admiral,
thinking to take or deſtroy them, ſent
two ſhips in after them—the Culloden
and the Conqueror. They ſoon came
up to the Frenchmen; and I ſaw a
ſmart fight here, both by ſea and land:
for the frigates were covered by bat-
teries, and they played upon our ſhips
moſt furiouſly, which they as furiouſly
returned, and for a long time a con-
ſtant firing was kept up on all ſides at
an amazing rate. At laſt one frigate
ſunk; but the people eſcaped, though
not without much difficulty: and a
little after ſome of the people left the
other frigate alſo, which was a mere
wreck.


<page 178>

143
wreck. However, our ſhips did not
venture to bring her away, they were
ſo much annoyed from the batteries,
which raked them both in going and
coming: their topmaſts were ſhot a-
way, and they were otherwiſe ſo much
ſhattered, that the admiral was obliged
to ſend in many boats to tow them
back to the fleet. I afterwards ſailed
with a man who fought in one of the
French batteries during the engage-
ment, and he told me our ſhips had
done confiderable miſchief that day
on ſhore and in the batteries.
After this we ſailed for Gibraltar,
and arrived there about Auguſt 1759.
Here weremained with all our ſails un-
bent, while the fleet was watering and
doing other neceſſary things. While
we were in this ſituation, one day the
admiral, with moſt of the principal of
ficers, and many people of all ſtations,
being

<page 179>

being on ſhore, about ſeven o'clock
in the evening we were alarmed by
ſignals from the frigates flationed for
that purpoſe; and in an inſtant there
was a general cry that the French fleet
was out, and juſt paſſing through the
ſtreights. The admiral immediately
came on board with ſome other of
ficers; and it is impoſſible to deſcribe
the noiſe, hurry and confuſion through-
out the whole fleet, in bending their
ſails and ſlipping their cables; many
people and ſhips' boats were left on
ſhore in the buſtle. We had two
captains onboard of our ſhip who came
away in the hurry and left their ſhips
to follow. We ſhewed lights from the
gun-wales to the main top maſt-head;
and all our lieutenants were employed
amongſt the fleet to tell the ſhips not
to wait for ther captains, but to put
the fails to the yards, ſlip their cables
3 and

<page 180>

and follow us; and in this confuſion
of making ready for fighting, we ſet
out for ſea in the dark after the French
fleet. Here I could have exclaimed
with Ajax,
“Oh Jovel O father! iſ it be thy will
* That we muſt periſh, we thy will obey,
“Butletus periſh by the light of day.”
They had got the ſtart of us ſo far
that we were not able to come up with
them during the night; but at day-light
we ſaw ſeven ſail of the line of battle
ſome miles ahead. We immediately
chaſed them till about four o'clock
in the evening, when our ſhips Canne
up with them; and, though we were
about fifteen large ſhips, our gallant
admiral only fought them with his own
diviſion, which conſiſted of feven;
ſo that we were juſt ſhip for ſhip.
We paſſed by the whole of the enemy's
fleet in order to come at their com_

mander, Monſ. La Clue, who was in
the Ocean, an eighty-four gun ſhip:
as we paſſed they all fired on us;
and at one time three of them fired
together, continuing to do ſo for ſome
time. Notwithſtanding which our ad-
miral would not ſuffer a gun to be fired
at any of them, to my aſtoniſhment,
but made us lie on our bellies on the
deck till we came quite cloſe to the
Ocean, who was ahead of them all;
when we had orders to pour the whole
three tiers into her at once.
The engagement now commenced
with great fury on both ſides: the Ocean
immediately returned our fire, and we
continued engaged with each other for
ſome time; during which I was fre-
quently ſtunned with the thundering
of the great guns, whoſe dreadful con-
tents hurried many of my companions
into awful etermity. At laſt the French
line

<page 182>

ºf
line was entirely broken, and we obtain-
ed the vićtory, which was immediately
proclaimed with loud huzzas and ac-
clamations. Wetook three prizes, La
Modeſte, of ſixty-four guns, and Le
Temeraire and Centaur, of ſeventy-
four guns each. The reſt of the French
ſhips took to flight with all the ſail they
could crowd. Ourſhip being very much
damaged, and quite diſabled from pur-
ſuing the enemy, the admiral imme-
diately quitted her, and went in the
broken and only boat we had left on
board the Newark, with which, and
fome other ſhips, he went after the
French. The Ocean, and another
large French ſhip, called the Redoubt-
able, endeavouring to eſcape, ran
aſhore at Cape Logas, on the coaſt of
Portugal; and the French admiral and
ſome of the crew got aſhore; but we,
finding it impoſſible to get the ſhips
H 2 off,

<page 183>


L I48
off, ſet fire to them both. About
midnight I ſaw the Ocean blow up,
with a moſt dreadful exploſion. I
never beheld a more awful ſcene. In
leſs than a minute, the midnight for a
certain ſpace ſeemed turned into day by
the blaze, which was attended with a
noiſe louder and more terrible than
thunder, that ſeemed to rend every
element around us.
My ſtation during the engagement
was on the middle-deck, where I was
quartered with another boy, to bring
powder to the aftermoſt gun; and here
I was a witneſs of the dreadful fate of
many of my companions, who, in the
twinkling of an eye, were daſhed in
pieces, and launched into eternity.
Happily I eſcaped unhurt, though the
ſhot and ſplinters flew thick about me
during the whole fight. Towards the
latter part of it my maſter was wound-
º ed,
-

<page 184>

[ 149 |
ed, and I ſaw him carried down to the
ſurgeon; but though I was much
alarmed for him and wiſhed to aſſiſt
him I dared not leave my poſt. At
this ſtation my gun-mate (a partner in
bringing powder for the ſame gun)
and I ran a very great riſk for more
than half an hour of blowing up the
ſhip. For, when we had taken the car-
tridges out of the boxes, the bottoms
of many of them proving rotten, the
powder ran all about the deck, near
the match tub: we ſcarcely had water
enough atthe laſt to throw on it. We
were alſo, from our employment, very
much expoſed to the enemy's ſhots;
for we had to go through nearly the
whole length of the ſhip to bring the
powder. I expected therefore every
minute to be my laſt; eſpecially when
I ſaw our men fall ſo thick about me :
but, wiſhing to guard as much againſt

the dangers as poſſible, at firſt I thought
it would be ſafeſt not to go for the
powder till the Frenchmen had fired
their broadſide; and then, while they
were charging, I could go and come
with my powder: but immediately after-
wards I thought this caution was fruit-
leſs; and, cheering myſelf with the re-
flection that there was a time allotted
for me to die as well as to be born, I
inſtantly caſt off all fear or thought
whatever of death, and went through
the whole of my duty with alacrity;
pleaſing myſelf with the hope, if I fur-
vived the battle, of relating it and the
dangers I had eſcaped to the Miſs
Guerins, and others, when I ſhould re-
turn to London.
Our ſhip ſuffered very much in this
engagement; for, beſides the number
of our killed and wounded, ſhe was al-
moſt torn to pieces, and our rigging ſo
much

[ 151
much ſhattered, that our mizen-maſt,
main-yard, &c. hung over the ſide
of the ſhip; ſo that we were obliged
to get many carpenters, and others
from ſome of the ſhips of the fleet, to
aſſiſt in ſetting us in ſometolerable or-
der; and, notwithſtanding which, it took
us ſome time before we were complete-
ly refitted; after which we left Admi-
ral Broderick to command, and we,
with the prizes ſteered for England.
On the paſſage, and as ſoon as my
maſter was ſomething recovered of his
wounds, the admiral appointed him
captain of the Ætna fire-ſhip, on which
he and I left the Namur, and went on
board of her at ſea. I liked this little
ſhip very much. I now became the
captain's ſteward, in which ſituation
I was very happy: for I was ex-
tremely well treated by all on board;
and I had leiſure to improve myſelf in

reading and writing. The latterſ had
learned a little of before I left the Na-
mur, as there was a ſchool on board.
When we arrived at Spithead, the
AEtna went into Portſmouth harbour
to refit, which being done, we returned
to Spithead and joined a large fleet that
was thought to be intended againſt the
Havannah; but about that time the
king died; whether that prevented the
expedition I know not; but it cauſed
our ſhip to be ſtationed at Cowes, in
theiſle of Wight, till the beginning of
the year ſixty-one. Here I ſpent my
time very pleaſantly; I was much on
ſhore all about this delightful iſland,
and found the inhabitants very civil.
While I was here, I met with a
trifling incident, which ſurpriſed me
agreeably. I was one day in a field
belonging to a gentleman who had a
blackboy about my own ſize; this boy

having

<page 188>

[ 153 )
having obſerved me from his maſter's
houſe, was tranſported at the fight of
one of his own countrymen, and ran
to meet me with the utmoſt haſte. I
not knowing what he was about, tu rned
a little out of his way at firſt, but to no
purpoſe: he ſoon came cloſe to me
and caught hold of me in his arms as
if I had been his brother, though we
had never ſeen each other before. Af.
ter we had talked together for ſome
time he took me to his maſter's houſe,
where I was treated very kindly. This
benevolent boy and I were very happy
in frequently ſeeing each other till
about the month of March 1761, when
our ſhip had orders to fit out again
for another expedition. When we got
ready, we joined a very large fleet at
Spithead, commanded by Commodore
Keppel, which was deſtined againſt
Belle-Iſle, and with a number of ºrant
H 5 port

[ 154 J
port ſhips with troops onboard to make
a deſcent on the place, we ſailed once
more in queſt of fame. I longed to
engage in new adventures and ſee
freſh wonders.
I had a mind on which every thing
uncommon made its full impreſſion,
and every event which I conſidered
as marvellous. Every extraordinary
eſcape, or ſignal deliverance, either of
myſelf or others, I looked upon to be
effected by the interpoſition of Provi-
dence. We had not been above ten
days at ſea before an incident of this
kind happened; which, whatever cre-
dit it may obtain from the reader,
made no ſmall impreſſion on my mind.
We had on board a gunner, whoſe
name was John Mondle; a man of very
indifferent morals. This man’s cabin
was between the decks, exactly over
where I lay, abreaſt of the quarter-deck
- ladder.


<page 190>

[ 155 J
ladder. One night, the 5th of April,
being terrified with a dream, he awoke
in ſo great a fright that he could not reſt
in his bed any longer, nor even remainin
his cabin; and he went upon deck about
four o'clock in the morning extremely
agitated. He immediately told thoſe
on the deck of the agonies of his mind,
and the dream which occaſioned it; in
which he ſaid he had ſeen manythings
very awful, and had been warned by
St. Peter to repent, who told him time
was ſhort. This he ſaid had greatly
alarmed him, and he was determined
to alter his life. People generally
mock the fears of others when they
are themſelves in ſafety; and ſome of
his ſhipmates who heard him only
laughed at him. How ver, he mº ſe
* vow that he never would drink ſtrong
liquorS again; and he immediately got
a light, and gave *Way his ſea-ſtores
H 6 of

of liquor. After which, his agitation
ſtill continuing, he began to read the
Scriptures, hoping to find ſome relief;
and ſoon afterwardshelaid himſelf down
again on his bed, and endeavoured to
compoſe himſelf to ſleep, but to no
purpoſe; his mind ſtill continuing in a
ſtate of agony. By this time it was
exactly half after ſeven in the morn-
ing: I was then under the half-deck at
the great cabin door; and all at once
I heard the people in the waiſt cry out,
moſt fearfully—‘The Lord have mercy
upon us! We are all loſt! The
Lord have mercy upon us!” Mr.
Mondle hearing the cries, immediately
ran out of his cabin; and we were in-
ſtantly ſtruck by the Lynne, a forty-
gun ſhip, Captain Clark, which nearly
ran us down. This ſhip had juſt put
about, and was by the wind, but had
not got full headway, or we muſt all

have

<page 192>

157
have periſhed; for the wind was briſk.
However, before Mr Mondle had got
four ſteps from his cabin door, ſhe
ſtruck our ſhip with her cutwater right
in the middle of his bed and cabin,
and ran it up to the combings of the
quarter deck hatchway, and above three
feet below water, and in a minute there
was not a bit of wood to be ſeen where
Mr. Mondle's cabin ſtood; and he was
to near being killed that ſome of the
ſplinterstore his face. As Mr. Mon-
de muſt inevitably have periſhed from
this accident had he not been alarmed
in the very extraordinary way I have
related, I could not help regarding this
**nawful interpoſition of Providence
for his preſervation. The two ſhips
for ſome time ſwinged alongſide of
each other; for ours being al fireſhip,
ºur grappling-irons caught the Lynne

went at an aſtoniſhing rate. Ourſhip
was in ſuch a ſhocking condition that
we all thought ſhe would inſtantly go
down, and every one ran for their lives,
and got as well as they could on board
the Lynne; but our lieutenant being
the aggreſſor, he never quitted the
ſhip. However, when we found ſhe
did not ſink immediately, the captain
came on board again, and encouraged
our people to return and try to ſave
her. Many on this came back, but
fome would not venture, Some of the
ſhips in the fleet, ſeeing our ſituation,
immediately ſent their boats to our aſ-
fiſtance; but it took us the whole day
to ſave the ſhip with all their help.
And by uſing every poſſible means,
particularly frapping her together with
many hawſers, and putting a great
quantity of tallow below water where
#be was damaged, ſhe was kept to-
gether:

<page 194>

gether: but it was well we did not
meet with any gales of wind, or we
muſt have gone to pieces; for we were
in ſuch a crazy condition that we had
ſhips to attend us till we arrived at
Belle-Iſle, the place of our deſtination;
and then we had all things taken out
of the ſhip, and ſhe was properly re-
paired. This eſcape of Mr. Mon-
dle, which he, as well as myſelf, always
conſidered as a ſingular act of Provi-
dence, I believe had a great influence
on his life and conduct ever afterwards.
Now that I am on this ſubject I beg
leave to relate another inſtance or two
which ſtrongly raiſed my belief of the
particular interpoſition of Heaven, and
which might not otherways have found
a place here, from their inſignificance.
I belonged for a few days in the year
1758, to the Jaſon, of fifty-four guns,
* Plymouth; and one night, when I

was on board, a woman, with a child
at her breaſt, fell from the upper-deck
down into the hold, near the keel.
Every one thought that the mother and
child muſt be both daſhed to pieces,
but, to our great ſurpriſe, neither of
them was hurt. I myſelf one day fell
headlong from the upper-deck of the
AEtna down the after-hold, when the
ballaſt was out; and all who ſaw me
fall cried out I was killed: but I re-
ceived not the leaſt injury. And in
the ſame ſhip a man fell from the maſt.
head on the deck without being hurt.
In theſe, and in many more inſtances,
I thought I could plainly trace the
hand of God, without whoſe permiſ.
fion a ſparrow cannotfall. I began to
raiſe my fear from man to him alone,
and to call daily on his holy name with
fear and reverence: and I truſt he
heard my ſupplications, and graciouſly
condeſcended

<page 196>

| 161 ;
condeſcended to anſwer me according
to his holy word, and to implant the
ſeeds of piety in me, even one of the
meaneſt of his creatures.
When we had refitted our ſhip, and
all things were in readineſs for attack-
ing the place, the troops on board the
tranſports were ordered to diſembark;
and my maſter as a junior captain,
had a ſhare in the command of the
landing. This was on the 12th of
April. The French were drawn up on
the ſhore, and had made every diſpo-
fition to oppoſe the landing of our
men, only a ſmall part of them this day
being able to effect it; moſt of them,
after fighting with great bravery, were
cut off; and General Crawford, with a
number of others, were taken priſon-
* In this day's engagement we had

On the 21ſt of April werenewed our

efforts to land the men, while all the
men of war were ſtationed along the
ſhore to cover it, and fired at the
French batteries and breaſtworks from
early in the morning till about four
o'clock in the evening, when our ſo-
diers effected a ſafe landing. They
immediately attacked the French; and,
after a ſharp encounter, forced them
from the batteries. Before the enemy
retreated they blew up ſeveral of them,
left they ſhould fall into our hands.
Our men now proceeded to beſiege the
citadel, and my maſter was ordered on
ſhore to ſuperintend the landing of all
the materials neceſſary for carrying on
the fiege; in which ſervice I moſtly at-
tended him. While I was there I went
about to different parts of the iſland;
and one day, particularly, my curioſity
almoſt coſt me my life. I wanted very
much to ſee the mode of charging the

for that purpoſe I went to an Engliſh
battery that was but a very few yards
from the walls ofthecitadel. There, in-
deed, I had an opportunity ofcompletely
gratifying myſelf in ſeeing the whole
operation, and that not without run-
ning a very great riſk, both from the
Engliſh ſhells that burſt while I was
there, but likewiſe from thoſe of the

ſhells burſted within nine or ten yards
of me: there was a ſingle rock cloſe
by, about the ſize of a butt; and I got
inſtant ſhelter under it in time to avoid
the fury of the ſhell. Where it burſt
the earth was torn in ſuch a manner
that two or three butts might eaſily
have gone into the hole it made, and
it threw great quantities of ſtones and
dirt to a confiderable diſtance. Three

them in particular ſeemed

for with a moſt dreadful ſound it hiſſed
cloſe by me, and ſtruck a rock at a
little diſtance, which it ſhattered to
pieces. When I ſaw what perilous
circumſtances I was in, I attempted
to return the neareſt way I could find,
and thereby I got between the Engliſh
and the French centinels. An Engliſh
ſerjeant, who commanded the outpoſts,
ſeeing me, and ſurpriſed how I came
there, (which was by ſtealth along the
ſeaſhore), reprimanded mevery ſeverely
for it, and inſtantly took the centinel
off his poſt into cuſtody, for his ne-
gligence in ſuffering me to paſs the
lines. While I was in this ſituation

for the greater expedition of getting off.
Accordingly I took ſome cord which I
had about me, and making a kind of
bridle of it, I put it round the horſe's
head, and the tame beaſt very quietly
ſuffered me to tie him thus and mount
him. As ſoon as I was on the horſe's
back I began to kick and beat him, and
try every means to make him go quick,
butallto very little purpoſe: I could not
drive him out of a ſlow pace. While
I was creeping along, ſtill within reach
of the enemy's ſhot, I met with a ſer-
vant well mounted on an Engliſh horſe,
I immediately ſtopped; and, crying,
told him my caſe; and begged of him
to help me, and this he effectually did;
for, having a fine large whip, he be-
gan to laſh my horſe with it ſo fe-
verely, that he ſet off full ſpeed with
me towards the ſea, while I was quite
unable to hold or manage him. In
this

<page 201>

this manner I went along till I came
to a craggy precipice. I now could
not ſtop my horſe; and my mind was
filled with apprehenſions of my deplor-
able fate ſhould he go down the pre-
cipice, which he appeared fully diſ.
poſed to do: I therefore thought I had
better throw myſelf off him at once,
which I did immediately with a great
deal of dexterity, and fortunately eſcap-
cd unhurt. As ſoon as I found my-
ſelf at liberty I made the beſt of my
way for the ſhip, determined I would
not be ſo fool-hardy again in a hurry.
We continued to beſiege the citadel
till June, when it ſurrendered. During
the ſiege I have counted above ſixty
ſhells and carcaſes in the air at once.
When this place was taken I went
through the citadel, and in the bomb-
proofs under it, which were cut in the
ſolid rock; and I thought it a ſurpriſing
place,

place, both for ſtrength and building:
notwithſtanding which our ſhots and
ſhells had made amazing devaſtation,
and ruinous heaps all around it.
After the taking of this iſland, our
ſhips with ſome others commanded -
by commodore Stanhope in the Swift-
ſure, went to Baſſe-road, where we
blocked up a French fleet. Our ſhips
were there from June till February fol-
lowing; and in that time I ſaw a great
many ſcenes of war, and ſtratagems on
both ſides to deſtroy each others fleet.
Sometimes we would attack the French
with ſome ſhips of the line; at other
times with boats; and frequently we
made prizes. Once or twice the
French attacked us by throwing ſhells
with their bomb-veſſels; and one day
as a French veſſel was throwing ſhells
atour ſhips ſhe broke from her ſprings,
behind ths iſle of I de Re; the tide be-

and then let them float down with the
tide; but each time we ſent boats with
graplings, and towed them ſafe out of
the fleet. -
We had different commanders while
we were at this place, Commodores
Stanhope, Dennis, Lord Howe, &c.
From hence, before the Spaniſh war
began, our ſhip and the Waſp ſloop
were ſent to St. Sebaſtian in Spain, by
Commodore Stanhope; and Commo-
dore Dennis afterwards ſent our ſhip as
a cartel to Bayonne in France", after

which we went in February in 1762,
to Belle Iſle, and there ſtayed till the
ſummer, when we left it, and returned
to Portſmouth. -
After our ſhip was fitted out again
for ſervice, in September ſhe went to
Guernſey, where I was very glad to ſee
Indies, where they ſold ſlaves; and they confeſ-
fed they had made at one time a falſe bill of ſale,
and ſold two Portugueſe white men among a lot
of ſlaves.

before perſons die, their ward has been ſeen; that
is, ſome ſpirit exactly in their likeneſs, though
they are themſelves at other places at the ſame

Mondle ſaw one of our men, as he thought, in the
gun-room; and a little after, coming on the quar-
ter-deck, he ſpoke of ſome circumſtances of this
man to ſome of the officers. They told him that
the man was then out of the ſhip, in one of the
boats with the Lieutenant: but Mr. Mondle
would not believe it, and we ſearched the ſhip,
when he found the man was actually out of her;
and when the boat returned ſome time after.

all-powerful fate had determined for
me. Our ſhip having arrived at Portſ.
mouth, we went into the harbour, and
remained there till the latter end of
November, when we heard great talk
about a peace; and, to our very great
joy, in the beginning of December
we had orders to go up to London
with our ſhip to be paid off. We re-
ceived this news with loud huzzas,
and every other demonſtration of glad-
neſs; and nothing but mirth was to
be ſeen throughout every part of the

ſhip. I too was not without my
ſhare of the general joy on this occa-
ſon. I thought now of nothing but
being freed, and working for myſelf,
and thereby getting money to enable
me to get a good education; for 1 al-
ways had a great deſire to be able at
leaſt to read and write; and while
was on ſhip-board I had endeavoured
to improve myſelf in both. While I
was in the Ætna particularly, the cap-
tain's clerk taught me to write, and
gave me a ſmattering of arithmetic
as far as the rule of three. There was
alſo one Daniel Queen, about forty
years of age, a man very well educat-
ed, who meſſed with me on board this
ſhip, and he likewiſe dreſſed and at-
tended the captain. Fortunately this
man ſoon became very much attached
to me, and took very great pains to in-
ſtruct me in many things. He taught
I 2 Inc.

[ 172 J
me to ſhave and dreſs hair a little, and
alſo to read in the Bible, explaining
many paſſages to me, which I did not
comprehend. I was wonderfully fur-
priſed to ſee the laws and rules of my
own country written almoſt exactly here,
a circumſtance which I believe tended
to impreſs our manners and cuſtoms
more deeply on my memory. I uſed
to tell him of this reſemblance; and
many a time we have fat up the whole
night together at this employment
In ſhort, he was like a father to me;
and ſome even uſed to call me after
his name; they alſo ſtyled me the
black Chriſtian. Indeed I almoſt low-
ed him with the affection of a ſon.
Many things I have denied myſelf
that he might have them; and when I
uſed to play at marbles or any other
game, and won a few halfpence, or
got any little money, which I ſome-
times

<page 208>

| 173 ]
times did, for ſhaving any one, I uſed
to buy him a little ſugar or tobacco,
as far as my ſtock of money would go.
He uſed to ſay, that he and I never
ſhould part; and that when our ſhip
was paid off, as I was as free as him-
ſelf or any other man on board, he
would inſtruct me in his buſineſs, by
which I might gain a good livelihood.
This gave me new life and ſpirits; and
my heart burned within me, while I
thought the time long till I obtained
my freedom. For though my maſter
had not promiſed it to me, yet, beſides
the aſſurances I had received that he
had no right to detain me, he always
treated me with the greateſt kindneſs,
and repoſed in me an unbounded con–
fidence; he even paid attention to my
morals; and would never ſuffer me to
deceive him, or tell lies, of which he
uſed to tell me the conſequences; and
I 3 that

that if I did ſo God would not love
me; ſo that from all this tenderneſs,
I had never once ſuppoſed, in all my
dreams of freedom, that he would
think of detaining me any longer than
I wiſhed. - -
In purſuance of our orders we ſailed
from Portſmouth for the Thames, and
arrived at Deptford the Ioth of De-
cember, where we caſt anchor juſt as it
was high water. The ſhip was up
about half an hour, when my maſter
ordered the barge to be manned; and
all in an inſtant, without having before
given metheleaſt reaſon to ſuſpect any
thing of the matter, he forced me into
the barge; ſaying, I was going to leave
him, but he would take care I ſhould
not. I was ſo ſtruck with the unex-
pectedneſs of this proceeding, that for
ſome time I did not make a reply,
only I made an offer to go for my
books

books and cheſt of clothº, but he
were I ſhould not move out of his
fight; and if I did he would cut my
throat, at the ſame time taking his
hanger, I began, however, tº collect
myſelf, and, plucking up courage.
I told him 1 was free, and he could
not by law ſerve meſo. But this only
enraged him the more; and he con-
tinued to ſwear, and ſaid he would
ſoon let me know whether he would or
not, and at that inſtant ſprung him-
ſelf into the barge from the ſhip, to
the aſtoniſhment and ſorrow of all on
board. The tide, rather unluckily for
me, had juſt turned downward, ſo that
we quickly fell down the river along
with it, till we came among ſome out-
ward-bound Weſt Indiamen, for he
was reſolved to put me on board the
firſt veſſel he could get to receive me.
The boat's crew, who pulled againſt
I 4 their


<page 211>

| 176
their will, became quite faint different
times, and would have gone aſhore;
but he would not let them. Some of
them ſtrove then to cheer me, and told
me he could not ſell me, and that they
would ſtand by me, which revived me
a little; and I ſtill entertained hopes,
for as they pulled along he aſked ſome
veſſels to receive me, but they would
not. But, juſt as we had got a little
below Graveſend, we came alongſide
of a ſhip which was going away the
next tide for the Weſt Indies; her
name was the Charming Sally, Captain
James Doran; and my maſter went
on board and agreed with him for me;
and in a little time I was ſent for into
the cabin. When I came there Cap-
tain Doran aſked me if I knew him:
I anſwered that I did not; ‘Then,
ſaid he, ‘you are now my ſlave.' I
told him my maſter could not ſell me
to

<page 212>

[ 177
to him, norto any one elſe. ‘Why," ſaid
he did not your maſter buy you?' I
confeſſed he did. But I have ſerved
him, ſaid I, many years, and he has
taken all my wages and prize-money,
for I only gotone ſixpence during the
war; beſides this I have been bap-
“tized; and by the laws of the land
* no man has a right to ſell me: And
I added, that I had heard a lawyer and
others at different times tell my maſter
ſo. They both then ſaid that thoſe
people who told me ſo were not my
friends; but I replied–. It was very
extraordinary that other people did
not know the law as well as they.’
Upon this Captain Doran ſaid I talk-
ed too much Engliſh; and if I did
not behave myſelf well, and be quiet,
he had a method on board to make
me. I was too well convinced of his
Power over me to doubt what he ſaid,

[ 178
and my former ſufferings in the ſlave-
ſhip preſenting themſelves to my mind,
the recollection of them made me
ſhudder. However, before I retired
I told them that as I could not get
any right among men here I hoped I
ſhould hereafter in Heaven; and Iim-
mediately left the cabin, filled with re-
ſentment and ſorrow. The only coatſ
had with me my maſter took away with
him, and ſaid, “If your prize-money
had been ſooool. I had a right to
“it all, and would have taken it.’ I had
about nine guineas, which, during my
long ſea-faring life, I had ſcraped to-
gether from trifling perquiſites and
little ventures; and I hid it that inſtant,
left my maſter ſhould take that from
me likewiſe, ſtill hoping that by ſome
means or other I ſhould make my
eſcape to the ſhore; and indeed ſome
of my old ſhipmates told me not to
deſpair,

<page 214>
[ 179 |
"deſpair, for they would get me back
again; and that, as ſoon as they could
get their pay, they would imme-
diately come to Portſmouth to me,
where this ſhip was going: but, alas !
all my hopes were baffled, and the
hour of my deliverance was as yet far off.
My maſter, having ſoon concluded his
bargain with the captain, came out of
the cabin, and he and his people got
into the boat and put off; I followed
them with aching eyes as long as I
could, and when they were out of
fight I threw myſelf on the deck,
with a heart ready to burſt with for.

had been perfect freedom; and whoſe
horrors, always preſent to my mind,
now ruſhed on it with tenfold aggra-
vation. I wept very bitterly for ſome
time: and began to think that I muſt
have done ſomething to diſpleaſe the
Lord, that he thus puniſhed me ſo fe-
verely. This filled me with painful
reflections on my paſt condućt; I re-
collected that on the morning of our
arrival at Deptford I had raſhly ſworn
that as ſoon as we reached London I
would ſpend the day in rambling and
ſport. My conſcience ſmote me for
this unguarded expreſſion: I felt that
the Lord was able to diſappoint me in
all things, and immediately conſider-
cd my preſent ſituation as a judgment
of Heaven on account of my preſump-
tion in ſwearing: I therefore, with con-
trition of heart, acknowledged my
tranſgreſſion to God, and poured out
my

<page 217>
[ 182
my ſoul before him with unſeigned re-
pentance, and with earneſt ſupplica-
tions I befought him not to abandon
me in my diſtreſs, nor caſt me from
his mercy for ever. In a little time
my grief, ſpent with its own violence,
began to ſubſide; and after the firſt
confuſion of my thoughts was over I
reflected with more calmneſs on my
preſent condition: I conſidered that
trials and diſappointments are ſome-
times for our good, and I thought God
might perhaps have permitted this in
order to teach me wiſdom and reſigna-
tion; for he had hitherto ſhadowed me
with the wings of his mercy, and by
his inviſiblebut powerful hand brought
me the way I knew not. Theſe re-
fle&tions gave me a little comfort, and
I roſe at laſt from the deck with de-
jection audſorrow in my countenance,
yet mixed with ſome faint hope that
the


<page 218>

[ 183 ||
the Lºrd would appear for my deli-
Verance. -
Soon afterwards, as my new maſter
was going on ſhore, he called me to him,
and told me to behave myſelf well, and
do the buſineſs of the ſhip the ſame as
any of the reſt of the boys, and that 1
ſhould fare the better for it; but I
made him no anſwer. I was then aſked
If I could ſwim, and I ſaid, No, How-
ever I was made to go under the
deck, and was well watched. The
next tide the ſhip got under way,
and ſoon after arrived at the Mother
Bank, Portſmouth; where ſhe waited a
few days for ſome of the Weſt India
convoy. While I was here I tried
every means I could deviſe amongſt
the people of the ſhip to get me a boat
from the ſhore, as there was none ſuf-
fered to come alongſide of the ſhip;
and their own, whenever it Was uſed,

was hoiſted in again immediately. A
ſailor on board took a guinea from me
on pretence of getting me a boat; and
promiſed me, time after time, that it
was hourly to come off. When he
had the watch upon deck I watched
alſo ; and looked long enough, but all
in vain; I could never ſee either the
boat or my guinea again. And what
I thought was ſtill the worſt of all, the
fellow gave information, as I after-
wards found, all the while to the
mates, of my intention to go off, if I
could in any way do it; but, rogue
like, he never told them he had got a
guinea from me to procure my eſcape.
However, after we had ſailed, and his
trick was made known to the ſhip's
crew, I had ſome ſatisfaction in ſeeing
him deteſted and deſpiſed by them all
for his behaviour to me. I was ſtill
in hopes that my old ſhipmates would
not

<page 220>

[ 13; J.
not forget their promiſe to come for
me to Portſmouth: and, indeed, at
laſt, but not till the day before we
ſailed, ſome of them did come there,
and ſent me off ſome oranges, and
other tokens of their regard. They
alſo ſent me word they would come
off to me themſelves the next day or
the day after; and a lady alſo, who
lived in Goſport, wrote to me that ſhe
would come and take me out of the
ſhip at the ſame time. This lady had
been once very intimate with my former
maſter: I uſed to ſell and take care of a
great deal of property for her, in dif-
ferent ſhips; and in return ſhe always
ſhewed great friendſhip for me, and
uſed to tell my maſter that ſhe would
take me away to live with her: but, un-
fortunately forme, a diſagreement ſoon
afterwards took place between them,

peared ſole miſtreſs of the Ætna, and
moſtly lodged on board. I was not
ſo great a favourite with this lady as
with the former; ſhe had conceived a
pique againſt me on ſome occaſion
when ſhe was on board, and ſhe did
not fail to inſtigate my maſter to treat
me in the manner he did".
However, the next morning, the
3oth of December, the wind being

then got up their anchors; and, be-
fore any of my friends had an oppor-
tunity to come off to my relief, to
my inexpreſſible anguiſh our ſhip had
got under way. What tumultuous
emotions agitated my ſoul when the
convoy got under ſail, and I a priſoner
on board, now without hope I kept
my ſwimming eyes upon the land in
a ſtate of unutterable grief; not know-
ing what to do, and deſpairing how
to help myſelf. While my mind was
in this ſituation the fleet ſailed on, and
in one day's time I loſt ſight of the
wiſhed-for land. In the firſt expreſ.
fions of my grief Ireproached my fate,
and wiſhed I had never been born.
I was ready to curſe the tide that bore
us, the gale that waſted my priſon,
and even the ſhip that conducted us;
and I called on death to relieveme
from the horrors I felt and dreaded,

The turbulence of my emotions how-
ever naturally gave way to calmer
thoughts, and I ſoon perceived what
fate had decreed no mortal on earth
could prevent. The convoy ſailed on
without any accident, with a pleaſant
gale and ſmooth ſea, for ſix weeks, till
February, when one morning the Æolus
ran down a brig, one of the convoy,
and ſhe inſtantly went down and was
ingulfed in the dark receſſes of the
ocean. The convoy was immediately
thrown into great confuſion till it was
day-light; and the Æolus was illu-
mined with lights to prevent any far-
ther miſchief. On the 13th of Febru-
ary 1763, from the maſt head, we deſ-
cried our deſtined iſland Montſerrat:

At the fight of this land of bondage, a
freſh horror ran through all my frame,
and chilled me to the heart. My ſor-
mer ſlavery now roſe in dreadful re-
view to my mind, and diſplayed no-
thing but miſery, ſtripes, and chains;
and, in the firſt paroxyſm of my grieſ,
I called upon God’s thunder, and his
avenging power, to direct the ſtroke of
death to me, rather than permit me to
become a ſlave, and be ſold from lord
to lord.
In this ſtate of my mind our ſhip
came to an anchor, and ſoon after diſ-
charged her cargo. I now knew what
it was to work hard; I was made to
help to unload and load the ſhip.
And, to comfort me in my diſtreſs in
that time, two of the ſailors robbed
me of all my money, and ran away
from the ſhip. I had been ſo long
uſed to an European climate, that at

firſt I felt the ſcorching Weſt India
ſun very painful, while the daſhing
ſurf would toſs the boat and the peo-
ple in it frequently above high water
mark. Sometimes our limbs were
broken with this, or even attended
with inſtant death, and I was day by
day mangled and torn. -
About the middle of May, when the
ſhip was got ready to ſail for England,

blackeſt clouds were gathering over
my head, and expecting their burſting
would mix me with the dead, Cap-
tain Doran ſent for me aſhore one
morning, and I was told by the meſ.
ſenger that my fate was then deter-
mined. With trembling ſteps and
fluttering heart I came to the captain,
and found with him one Mr. Romert
King, a quaker, and the firſt merchant
in the place. The captain then told

me my former maſter had ſent me
there to be ſold; but that he had de-
fired him to get me the beſt maſter he
could, as he told him I was a very de-
ſerving boy, which Captain Doran ſaid
he found to be true; and if he were
to ſtay in the Weſt Indies he would
be glad to keep me himſelf; but he
could not venture to take me to Lon-
don, for he was very ſure that when I
came there I would leave him. I at

Mr. King, my new maſter, then made
a reply, and ſaid the reaſon he had
bought me was on account of my good
character; and, as he had not the leaſt
doubt of my good behaviour, I ſhould
be very well off with him. He alſo
told me he did not live in the Weſt
Indies, but at Philadelphia, where he
was going ſoon; and, as I underſtood
ſomething of the rules of arithmetic,
when we got there he would put me to
ſchool, and fit me for a clerk. This
converſation relieved my mind a little,
and I left thoſe gentlemen conſiderably
more at caſe in myſelf than when I
came to them; and I was very thank.

old maſter, for the character they had
given me; a character which I after
wards found of infinite ſervice to me.

looked at her with a very wiſhful and
aching heart, and followed her with
my eyes until ſhe was totally out of

grief that I could not hold up my head
for many months; and if my new
maſter had not been kind to me Ibe-
lieve I ſhould have died under it at laſt.
And indeed I ſoon found that he fully
deſerved the good character which Cap-
tain Doran had given me of him; for
he poſſeſſed a moſt amiable diſpoſi-
tion and temper, and was very chari-
table and humane. If any of his ſlaves
behaved amiſs he did not beat or uſe
them ill, but parted with them. This
made them afraid of diſobliging him;
and as he treated his ſlaves better than
any other man on the iſland, ſo he
was better and more faithfully ſerved

ment I did at laſt endeavour to com—
poſe myſelf, and with fortitude, though
moneyleſs, determined to face what-
ever fate had decreed for me. Mr.
King ſoon aſked me what I could do;
and at the ſame time ſaid he did not
mean to treat me as a common ſlave.
I told him I knew ſomething of ſea-
manſhip, and could ſhave and dreſs
hair pretty well; and I could refine
wines, which I had learned on ſhip-
board, where I had often done it; and
that I could write, and underſtood
arithmetic tolerably well as far as
the Rule of Three. He then aſked
me if I knew anything of gauging:
and, on my anſwering that I did not,
he ſaid one of his clerks ſhould teach
me to guage:

ſix clerks. He loaded many veſſels in
a year; particularly to Philadelphia,
where he was born, and was connected
with a great mercantile houſe in that
city. He had beſides many veſſels
and droggers, of different ſizes, which
uſed to go about the iſland; and others
to collectrum, ſugar, and other goods.
I underſtood pulling and managing
thoſe boats very well; and this hard
work, which was the firſt that he ſet
me to, in the ſugar ſeaſons uſed to be
my conſtant employment. I have
rowed the boat, and ſlaved at the
oars, from one hour to ſixteen in the
twenty-four; during which I had ſiſ.
teen pence ſterling per day to live on,
though ſometimes only ten pence.
However this was confiderably more
than was allowed to other ſlaves that
uſed to work often with me, and be-
longed to other gentlemen on the

iſland: thoſe poor ſouls had never
more than nine-pence per day, and
ſeldom more than ſix-pence, from
their maſters or owners, though they
earned them three or four piſterines";
for it is a common practice in the
Weſt Indies for men to purchaſe ſlaves
though they have not plantations them-
ſelves, in order to let them out to
planters and merchants at ſo much a
piece by the day, and they give what
allowance they chuſe out of this pro-
duce of their daily work to their ſlaves
for ſubſiſtence; this allowance is often
very ſcanty. My maſter often gave
the owners of theſe ſlaves two and a
half of theſe pieces per day, and found
the poor fellows in vićtuals himſelf, be-
cauſe he thought their owners did not
feed them well enough according to the
* Theſe piſterines are of the value of a ſhilling.

work they did. The ſlaves uſed to like
this very well; and, as they knew my
maſter to be a man of feeling, they
were always glad to work for him
in preference to any other gentleman.
ſome of whom after they had been
paid for theſe poor people’s labours,
would not give them their allowance
out of it. Many times have I even
ſeen theſe unfortunate wretches beaten
for aſking for their pay; and often
ſeverely flogged by their owners if
they did not bring them their daily
or weekly money exactly to the time;
though the poor creatures were obliged
to wait on the gentlemen they had
worked for ſometimes for more than
half the day before they could get
their pay; and this generally on Sun-
days, when they wanted the time for
themſelves. In particular, I knew a
countryman of mine who once did not
bring

<page 234>

[ 199 |
bring the weekly money directly that
it was earned; and though he brought
it the ſame day to his maſter, yet he
was ſtaked to the ground for his pre-
tended negligence, and was juſt going
to receive a hundred laſhes, but for
a gentleman who begged him off fifty.
This poor man was very induſtrious;
and, by his frugality, had ſaved ſo
much money by working on ſhipboard,
that he had got a white man to buy
him a boat, unknown to his maſter.
Some time after he had this, little
eſtate, the governor wanted a boat to
bring his ſugar from different parts of
the iſland; and, knowing this to be a
negro-man's boat, he ſeized upon it
for himſelf, and would not pay the
owner a farthing. The man on this
went to his maſter, and complained
to him of this act of the governor;
but the only ſatisfaction he received
K 4 Was

<page 235>
| 200
was to be damned very heartly by
his maſter, who aſked him how dared
any of his negroes to have a boat.
If the juſtly-merited ruin of the go-
vernor's fortune could be any grati-
fication to the poor man he had thus
robbed, he was not without conſola-
tion. Extortion and rapine are poor
providers; and ſome time after this
the governor died in the King's Bench
in England, as I was told, in great
poverty. The laſt war favoured this
poor negro-man, and he found ſome
means to eſcape from his Chriſtian
maſter: he came to England; where
I ſaw him afterwards ſeveral times,
Such treatment as this often drives
theſe miſerable wretches to deſpair, and
they run away from their maſters at the
hazard of their lives. Many of them,

return home without it, run away

ſelf; and thereby he ſaved many of
them a flogging.
Once, for a few days, I was let
out to fit a veſſel, and I had no victuals
allowed me by either party; at laſt I
told my maſter of this treatment, and
he took me away from it. In many
of the eſtates, on the different iſlands
where I uſed to be ſent for rºm or
ſugar, they would not deliver it to me,
or any other negro; he was therefore
obliged to ſend a white man along
with me to thoſe places; and then he
uſed to pay him from ſix to ten piſ-
crines a day. From being thus em-

plºyed, during the time I ſerved Mr.
King, in going about the different
eſtates on the iſland, I had all the Op-
portunity I could wiſh for to ſee the
dreadful uſage of the poor men; uſage
that reconciled me to my ſituation,
and made me bleſs God for the hands
into which I had fallen.
I had the good fortune to pleaſe my
maſter in every department in which
he employed me; and there was
ſcarcely any part of his buſineſs, or
houſhold affairs, in which I was nºt
occaſionally engaged. I often ſup-
plied the place of a clerk, in receiving
and delivering cargoes to the ſhips, in
tending ſtores, and delivering goods:
and, beſides this, I uſed to ſhave and
dreſs my maſter when convenient, and
take care of his horſe; and when it
was neceſſary, which was very often,
I worked likewiſe on board of different
veſſels

<page 238>

| 203 ||
veſſels of his. By theſe means I be-
came very uſeful to my maſter; and
ſaved him, as he uſed to acknowledge,
above a hundred pounds a year. Nor
did he ſcruple to ſay I was of more ad-
vantage to him than any of his clerks :
though their uſual wages in the Weſt
Indies are from ſixty to a hundred
pounds current a year.
I have ſometimes heard it aſſerted
that a negro cannot earn his maſter
the firſt coſt; but nothing can be fur-
ther from the truth. I ſuppoſe nine
tenths of the mechanics throughout
the Weſt Indies are negro ſlaves; and
I well know the coopers among them
earn two dollars a day; the carpenters
the ſame, and oftentimes more; as
alſo the maſons, ſmiths, and fiſher-
men, &c. and I have known many
ſlaves whoſe maſters would not take
3. thouſand pounds current for them.
K 6 But

<page 239>

| 204 |
But ſurely this aſſertion refutes itſelf;
for, if it be true, why do the planters
and merchants pay ſuch a price for
ſlaves? And, above all, why do thoſe
who make this aſſertion exclaim the
moſt loudly againſt the abolition of the
ſlave trade? So much are men blinded,
and to ſuch inconſiſtent arguments are:
they driven by miſtaken intereſt! I
grant, indeed, that ſlaves are -ſome
times, by half-feeding, half-clothing,
over-working and ſtripes, reduced ſo
low, that they are turned out as unfit
for ſervice, and left to periſh in the
woods, or expire on a dunghill.
My maſter was ſeveral times offered
by different gentlemen one hundred
guineas for me; but he always told
them he would not ſell me, to my
great joy; and I uſed to double my di-
ligence and care for fear of getting into
the hands of thoſe men who did not
2 allow

allow a valuable ſlave the common
ſupport of life. Many of them even
uſed to find fault with my maſter for
feeding his ſlaves ſo well as he did;
although I often went hungry, and an
Engliſhman might think my fare very
indifferent; but he uſed to tell them
he always would do it, becauſe the
ſlaves thereby looked better and did
more work.
While I was thus employed by my
maſter I was often a witneſs to cruelties
of every kind, which were exerciſed
on my unhappy fellow ſlaves. I uſed
frequently to have different cargoes of
new negroes in my care for ſale; and it
was almoſt a conſtant practice with our
clerks, and other whites, to commit
violent depredations on the chaſtity of
the female ſlaves; and theſe I was,
though with reluctance, obliged to
ſubmit to at all times, being unable to
help

<page 241>
[ 206
help them. When we have had ſome
of theſe ſlaves on board my maſter's
veſſels to carry them to other iſlands,
or to America, I have known our mates
to commit theſe acts moſt ſhamefully,
to the diſgrace, not of Chriſtians only,
but of men. I have even known them
gratify their brutal paſſion with females
not ten years old; and theſe abomi-
nations ſome of them practiſed to ſuch
ſcandalous exceſs, that one of our cap-
tains diſcharged the mate and others
on that account. And yet in Mont-
ſerrat I have ſeen a negro man ſtaked
to the ground, and cut moſt ſhock-
| ingly, and then his ears cut off bit by
| bit, becauſe he had been connected
with a white woman who was a com-
mon ptoſtitute: as if it were no crime
in the whites to rob an innocent Afri-
can girl of her virtue; but moſt hein-

paſſion of nature, where the tempº
tion was offered by one of a different
colour, though the moſt abandoned
woman of her ſpecies.
One Mr. D–– told me that he
had ſold 41boo negroes, and that he
once cut off a negro-man's leg for
running away—I aſked him if the
man had died in the operation, how
he as a chriſtian could anſwer for the
horrid act before God? and he told
me, anſwering was a thing of ano-
ther world; what he thought and did
were policy. I told him that the
chriſtian doctrine taught us to do unto
others as we would that others ſhould
do unto us. He then ſaid that his
ſcheme had the deſired effect—it cur-
ed that man and ſome others of run-
ning away. -
Another negro-man was half hange,

ſon a cruel overſeer. Thus by re-
peated cruelties are the wretched firſt
urged to deſpair, and then murdered,
becauſe they ſtill retain ſo much of hu-
man nature about them as to wiſh to
put an end to their miſery, and retali-
ate on their tyrants! Theſe overſeers
are indeed for the moſt part perſons of
the worſt character of any denomina-
tion of men in the Weſt Indies, Un-
fortunately, many humane gentlemen,
by not reſiding on their eſtates, are
obliged to leave the management of
them in the hands of theſe human
butchers, who cut and mangle the
ſlaves in a ſhocking manner on the
moſt trifling occaſions, and altogether
treat them in every reſpect like brutes.
They pay no regard to the ſituation of
pregnant women, nor the leaſt atten-
tion to the lodging of the field negroes.
Their huts, which ought to be well co-
wered, and the place dry where they

take their little repoſe, are often open
ſheds, built in damp places; ſo that,
when the poor creatures return tired
from the toils of the field, they con-
trad many diſorders, from being ex-
poſed to the damp air in this uncom-
fortable ſtate, while they are heated,
and their pores are open. This neg-
lect certainly conſpires with many
others to cauſe a decreaſe in the births
as well as in the lives of the grown
negroes. I can quote many inſtances
of gentlemen who reſide on their
eſtates in the weſt Indies, and then
the ſcene is quite changed; the ne-
groes are treated with lenity and pro-
per care, by which their lives are pro-
longed, and their maſters profited.

keeps them healthy, and as happy as
the condition of ſlavery can admit. I
myſelf, as ſhall appear in the ſequel,
managed an eſtate, where, by thoſe at-
tentions, the negroes were uncommº-
ly cheerful and healthy, and did more
work by half than by the common
modeoftreatment they uſually do. For
want, therefore, of ſuch care and atten-
tion to the poor negroes, and otherwiſe
oppreſſed as they are, it is no wonder
that the decreaſe ſhould require 20,000
new negroes annually to fill up the
vacant places of the dead.
Even in Barbadoes, notwithſtanding
thoſe humane exceptions which I have
mentioned, and others I am acquaint-
ed with, which juſtly make it quoted
as a place where ſlaves meet with the
beſt treatment, and need feweſt recruits

iſland requires loco negroes annually
to keep up the original ſtock, which is
only 80,000. So that the whole term
of a negro's life may be ſaid to be there
but fixteen years ºf And yet the cli-
mate here is in every reſpect the ſame
as that from which they are taken, ex-
cept in being more wholeſome. Do

and Weſt India climate?
While I was in Montſerrat I knew a
negro man, named Emanuel Sankey,
who endeavoured to eſcape from his
miſerable bondage, by concealing him-
ſelf on board of a London ſhip; but

man; for, being diſcovered when the

ºffer immediately pinned the wretch
down to the ground at each wriſt and
ancle, and thentook ſome ſticks of ſeal-
ing wax, and lighted them, and drop-
edit all over his back. There was an-
other maſter who was noted for cruelty;
and I believe he had not a ſlave but
what had been cut, and had pieces
fairly taken out of the fleſh: and after
they had been puniſhed thus, he uſed
to make them get into a long wooden
box or caſe he had for that purpoſe, in
which he ſhutthem up during pleaſure.
It was juſt about the height and breadth
of a man; and the poor wretches had
no room, when in the caſe to move.
It was very common in ſeveral of
the iſlands, particularly in St. Kitt's,
for the ſlaves to be branded with the
initial letters of their maſter's name;
and a load of heavy iron hooks hung
about their necks, Indeed on the moſt
trifling

trifling occaſions they were loaded with
chains; and often inſtruments of tor-
ture were added. The iron muzzle,
thumb-ſcrews, &c. are ſo well known,
as not to need a deſcription, and were
ſometimes applied for the ſlighteſt
faults. I have ſeen a negro beaten
till ſome of his bones were broken, for
only letting a potboil over. Is it ſur-
priſing that uſage like this ſhould drive
the poor creatures to deſpair, and make
them ſeek a refuge in death from thoſe
evils which render their lives intoler
able—while,
“With ſhudd'ring horror pale, and eyes aghaſt,
* They view their lamentable lot, and find
** No reſt!”
This they frequently do. A ne-
gro-man on board a veſſel of my
maſter, while I belonged to her, have

took an opportunity of jumping over-
board into the ſea; however, he was
picked up without being drowned.
Another, whoſe life was alſo a burden
to him, reſolved to ſtarve himſelf to
death, and refuſed to eat any vićtuals:
this procured him a ſevere flogging:
and he alſo, on the firſt occaſion which

their time will admit. This they com-
monly tie up in a parcel; either a bit's
worth (ſix-pence) or half a bit’s worth;
and bring it to town, or to the market,
to ſell. Nothing is more common
than for the white people on this oc-
caſion to take the graſs from them
without paying for it; and not only
ſo, but too often alſo, to my know-

of violence on the poor, wretched, and

The ſmall account in which the life
of a negro is held in the Weſt Indies,
is ſo univerſally known, that it might
ſeem impertinent to quote the fºllow-
ing extract, if ſome people had not
been hardy enough of late to aſſert
that negroes are on the ſame footing in
that reſpect as Europeans. By the
329th Act, page 125, of the Aſſembly
of Barbadoes, it is enacted That if
any negro, or other ſlave, under pu-
niſhment by his maſter, or his order,
* for running away, or any other crime
* or miſdemeanor towards his ſaid
• maſter, unfortunately ſhall ſuffer in

or only of bloody-mindedneſs, or cruel
intenſion, wilfully kill a negro, or other
“ſlave, ºf his own, he / all pay into the
public treaſury fifteen pounds ſerling.”
And it is the ſame in moſt, if not all,
of the Weſt India iſlands. Is not this
one of the many acts of the iſlands
which call loudly for redreſs 2 And
do not the Aſſembly which enacted it
deſerve the appellation of ſavages and
brutes rather than of chriſtians and
men? It is an act at once unmerciful,
unjuſt, and unwiſe; which for cruelty
would diſgrace an aſſembly of thoſe
who are called barbarians; and for its
injuſtice and inſanity would ſhock the
morality and common ſenſe of a Sa-
maide or Hottentot.

view appear, how is the iniquity of it
heightened when we conſider to whom
it may be extended! Mr. James Tobin,
a zealous labourer in the vineyard of
ſlavery, gives an account of a French
planter of his acquaintance, in the
iſland of Martinico, who ſhewed him
many mulattoes working in the fields
like beaſts of burden; and he told Mr.
Tobin theſe were all the produce of his
own loins! And I myſelf have known
ſimilar inſtances. Pray, reader, are
theſe ſons and daughters of the French
planter leſs his children by being be-
gotten on black women? And what
muſt be the virtue of thoſe legiſlators,
and the feelings of thoſe fathers, who
eſtimate the lives of their ſons, how-
ever begotten, at no more than fif.
teen pounds; though they ſhould be
murdered, as the act ſays, out of twº-
tonneſs and bloody-mindedneſs! But is
not

<page 256>

[ 221
not the ſlave trade entirely a war with
the heart of man? And ſurely that
which is begun by breaking down the
barriers of virtue involves in its conti-
nuance deſtruction to every principle,
and buries all ſentiments in ruin!
I have often ſeen ſlaves, particularly
thoſe who were meagre, in different
iſlands, put into ſcales and weighed;
and then ſold from three pence to ſix
pence or nine pence a pound. My
maſter, however, whoſe humanity was
ſhocked at this mode, uſed to ſell ſuch
by the lump. And at or after a ſale
it was not uncommon to ſee negroes
taken from their wives, wives taken
from their huſbands, and children from
their parents, and ſent off to other
iſlands, and wherever elſe their mer-
cileſs lords chooſe; and probably ne-
ver more during life ſee each other!

A poor Creole negro I knew well,
who, after having been often thus
tranſported from iſland to iſland, at
laſt reſided in Montſerrat. This man
uſed to tell me many melancholy tales
of himſelf. Generally, after he had
done working for his maſter, he uſed
to employ his few leiſure moments to
go a fiſhing. When he had caught
any fiſh, his maſter would frequently
take them from him without paying
him; and at other times ſome other
white people would ſerve him in the
ſame manner. One day he ſaid to me,

in all the different iſlands in which I
have been (and I have viſited no leſs
than fifteen) the treatment of the ſlaves
was nearly the ſame; ſo nearly indeed,
that the hiſtory of an iſland, or even a
plantation, with a few ſuch exceptions
as I have mentioned, might ſerve for
a hiſtory of the whole. Such a ten-
dency has the ſlave-trade to debauch
men's minds, and harden them to every
feeling of humanity! For I will not
ſuppoſe that the dealers in ſlaves are
born worſe than other men—No, it is
the fatality of this miſtaken avarice,
that it corrupts the milk of human
kindneſs and turns it into gall. And,
had the purſuits of thoſe men been
different, they might have been as
generous as tender-hearted and juſt,
as they are unfeeling, rapacious and
cruel. Surely this traffic cannot be
good, which ſpreads like a peſtilence,
and taints what it touches! which
- violates



<page 260>

[ 225
violates that firſt natural right of man-
kind, equality and independency, and
gives one man a dominion over his
fellows which God could never intend!
For it raiſes the owner to a ſtate as far
above man as it depreſſes the ſlave be-
low it; and, with all the preſumption
of human pride, ſets a diſtinction be-
tween them, immeaſurable in extent,
and endleſs in duration Yet how miſ-
takenis the avarice even of the planters.
Are ſlaves more uſeful by being thus
humbled tothecondition of brutes, than
they would beifſuffered to enjoy the pri-
vileges of men The freedom which
diffuſes health and proſperity through
out Britain anſwers you—No. When
you make men ſlaves you deprive them
of half their virtue, you ſet them in
your own conduct an example of fraud,
rapine, and cruelty, and compel them
to live with you in a ſtate of war; and

yet you complain that they are not ho-
neſt or faithful! You ſtupify them with
ſtripes, and think it neceſſary to keep
them in a ſtate of ignorance; and yet
you aſſert that they are incapable of
learning; that their minds are ſuch
a barren ſoil or moor, that culture
would be loſt on them; and that they
come from a climate, where nature,
though prodigal of her bounties in a
degree unknown to yourſelves, has left
man alone ſcant and unfiniſhed, and
incapable of enjoying the treaſures
ſhe has poured out for him –An aſ-
fertion at once impious and abſurd.
Why do you uſe thoſe inſtruments of
torture? Are they fit to be applied by
one rational being to another? And
are ye not ſtruck with ſhame and mor-
tification, to ſee the partakers of your
nature reduced ſo low? But, above all,
are there no dangers attending this

But by changing your conduct, and
treating your ſlaves as men, every

to in the Weſt Indies: but, were I to
enumerate them all, the catalogue would
betedious and diſguſting. The puniſh-
ments of the ſlaves on every trifling oc-
caſion are ſo frequent, and ſo well known
together with the different inſtruments
with which they are tortured, that it
cannot any longer afford novelty to
recite them; and they are too ſhock-
ing to yield delight either to the writer
or the reader. F ſhall therefore here-
after only mention ſuch as incidentally
befell myſelf in the courſe of my ad-
Ventures.
In the variety of departments in
which I was employed by my maſter, I
had an opportunity of ſeeing many cu-
rious ſcenes in different iſlands; but,
above all, I was ſtruck with a celebrated
curioſity called Brimſtone-Hill, which
is a high and ſteep mountain, ſome
few miles from the town of Plymouth
in Montſerrat. Ihadoffenheard ofſome
wonders

<page 265>
[ 230 J
wonders that were to be ſeen on this
hill, and I went once with ſome white
and black people to viſit it. When we
arrived at the top, I ſaw under different
cliffs great flakes of brimſtone, occa-
fioned by the ſteams of various little
ponds, which were then boiling natu-
rally in the earth. Some of theſe ponds
were as white as milk, ſome quite
blue, and many others of different co-
lours. I had taken ſome potatoes with
me, and I put them into different ponds,
and in a few minutes they were well
boiled. I taſted ſome of them, but they
were very ſulphurous; and the ſilver
ihoe buckles, and all the other things
of that metal we had among us, were,
in a little time turned as black as lead.
Sometime in the year 1763, kind Pro-
vidence ſeemed to appear rather more
favourable to me. One of my maſter's
veſſels, a Bermudas ſloop, about fixty
tons burthen was commanded by one
Captain


<page 266>

f 231
Captain Thomas Farmer, an Engliſh-
man, a very alert and active man, who
gained my maſter a great deal of mo-
ney by his good mangement in carry-
ing paſſengers from one iſland to ano-
ther; but very often his ſailors uſed to
get drunk and run away from the veſſel,
which hindered him in his buſineſs very
much. This man had taken a liking to
me; and many different times begged
of my maſter to let me go a trip with
him as a ſailor; but he would tell him
he could not ſpare me, though the veſ-
fel ſometimes could not go for want of
hands, for ſailors were generally very
ſcarce in the iſland. However, at laſt,
from neceſſity or force, my maſter was
prevailed on, though very reluctantly,
to let me go with this captain; but he
gave him great charge to take care that
I did not run away, for if I did he
would make him pay for me. This
being the caſe, the captain had for
ſome

<page 267>

[ 232
ſome time a ſharp eye upon me when-
ever the veſſel anchored; and as ſoon
as ſhe returned I was ſent for on ſhore
again. Thus was Iſlaving as it were
for life, ſometimes at one thing, and
ſometimes at another; ſo that the cap-
tain and I were nearly the moſt uſeful
men in my maſter’s employment. I
alſo became ſo uſeful to the captain
on ſhipboard, that many times, when
he uſed to aſk for me to go with him,
though it ſhould be but for twenty-
four hours, to ſome of the iſlands near
us, my maſter would anſwer he could
not ſpare me, at which the captain
would ſwear, and would not go the trip;
and tell my maſter I was better to him
on board than any three white men he
had; for they uſed to behave ill in
many reſpects, particularly in getting
drunk; and then they ºuently got
the boat ſtove, ſo as to hinder the veſ-

fel from coming back as ſoon as the
might


<page 268>

[ 233
might have done. This my maſter
knew very well; and at laſt, by the
captain's conſtant entreaties, after
I had been ſeveral times with him,
one day to my great joy, told me
the captain would not let him reſt,
and aſked whether I would go aboard
as a ſailor, or ſtay on ſhore and mind
the ſtores, for he could not bear any
longer to be plagued in this manner.
I was very happy at this propoſal, for
I immediately thought I might in time
ſtand ſome chance by being on board
to get a little money, or poſſibly make
my eſcape if I ſhould be uſed ill: I
alſo expected to get better food, and in
greater abundance; for Ihad oftentimes
felt much hunger, though my maſter
treated his ſlaves, as I have obſerved,
uncommonly well. I therefore, with-
out heſitation, anſwered him, that I
would go and be a ſailor if he pleaſed.
Accordingly I was ordered on board
- directly.



<page 269>

I 234
directly. Nevertheleſs, between the
veſſel and the ſhore, when ſhe was in
port, I had little or no reſt, as my
maſter always wiſhed to have me along
with him. Indeed he was a very plea-
fant gentleman, and but for my expec-
tations on ſhipboard I ſhould not have
thought of leaving him. But the cap-
tain liked me alſo very much, and I
was entirely his right-hand man. I did
all I could to deſerve his favour, and
in return I received better treatment
from him than any other I believe ever
met with in the Weſt Indies in my
ſituation.
After I had been ſailing for ſometime
with this captain, at length I endea-
voured to try my luck and commence
merchant. I had but a very ſmall ca-
pital to begin with ; for one ſingle half
bit, which is equal to three-pence in
England, made up my whole ſtock.

However I truſted to the Lord to be
with

<page 270>

[ 235
with me; and at one of our trips to
St. Euſalia, a Dutch iſland, I bought
a glaſs tumbler with my halfbit, and
when I came to Montſerrat I ſold it for
a bit, or ſix-pence. Luckily we made
ſeveral ſucceſſive trips to St. Euſtatia
(which was a general mart for the
Weſt Indies, about twenty leagues from
Montſerrat) and in our next, finding
my tumbler ſo profitable, with this one
bit I bought two tumblers more; and
when I came back 1 ſold them for two
bits equal to a ſhillingſterling. When
we went again. I bought with theſe two
bits four more of theſe glaſſes, which
I ſold for fout bits on our return to
Montſerrat; and in our next voyage
to St. Euſtatia, I bought two glaſſes
with one bit, and with the other three
I bought a jug of Geneva, rearly about
three pints in meaſure. When we came
to Montſerrat, I ſold the gin for eight
bits, and the tumblers for two, ſo that
my

<page 271>

ſ 236 J
my capital now amounted in all to a
dollar, well huſbanded and acquired
in the ſpace of a month or fix weeks,
when I bleſſed the Lord that I was ſo
rich. As we ſailed to different iſlands,
I laid this money out in various things
occaſionally, and it uſed to turn to
very good account, eſpecially when we
went to Guadaloupe, Grenada, and the
reſt of the French iſlands. Thus was
I going all about the iſlands upwards
of four years, and ever trading as I
went, during which I experienced many
inſtances of ill uſage, and have ſeen
many injuries done to other negroes in
our dealings with whites: and, amidſt
our recreations, when we have been
dancing and merry-making, they,
without cauſe, have moleſted and in-
ſulted us. Indeed I was more than
once obliged to look up to God on
high, as I had adviſed the poor fiſher-

man ſome time before. And I had not
been

<page 272>

[ 237
been long trading for myſelf in the
manner I have related above, when I
experienced the like trial in company
with him as follows: This man being
uſed to the water, was upon an emer-
gency put on board of us by his maſter
to work as another hand, on a voyage
to Santa Cruz; and at our ſailing he
had brought his little all for a venture
which conſiſted of ſix bits’ worth of
limes and oranges in a bag; I had alſo
my whole ſtock, which was abouttwelve
bits’ worth of the ſame kind of goods,
ſeparate in two bags; for we had heard
theſe fruits ſold well in that iſland.
When we came there, in ſome little
convenient time he and I went aſhore
with our fruits to ſell them ; but we
had ſcarcely landed when we were met
by two white men, who preſently took
our three bags from us. We could
not at firſt gueſs what they meant to
do; and for ſome time we thought
they




<page 273>

238 )
they were jeſting with us; but they too
ſoon let us know otherwiſe, for they
took our ventures immediately to a
houſe hard by, and adjoining the fort,
while we followed all the way begging
of them to give us our fruits, but in
vain. They not only refuſed to return
them but ſwore at us, and threatened
if we did not immediately depart they
would flogus well. We told them theſe
three bags were all we wereworthin the
world, and that we brought them with
us to ſell when we came from Mont-
ſerrat, and ſhewed them the veſſel.
But this was rather againſt us, as they
now ſaw we were ſtrangers as well
as ſlaves. They ſtill therefore ſwore,
and deſired us to be gone, and even
took ſticks to beat us; while we, ſeeing
they meant what they ſaid, went offin
the greateſt confuſion and deſpair.
Thus, in the very minute of gaining
more by three times than I ever did
by
3


<page 274>

I 239 |
by any venture in my life before, was
I-deprived of every farthing I was
worth. An inſupportable misfortune!
but how to help ourſelves we knew
not. In our conſternation we went to
the commanding officer of the fort,
and told him how we had been ſerved
by ſome of his people; but we obtained
not the leaſt redreſs: he anſwered our
complaints only by a volley of impre-
cations againſt us, and immediately
took a horſe-whip, in order to chaſtiſe
us, ſo that we were obliged to turn
out much faſter than we came in. I
now, in the agony of diſtreſs and indig-
nation, wiſhed that the ire of God in his
forked lightning might transfix theſe
cruel oppreſſors among the dead. Still
however we perſevered; went back
again to the houſe, and begged and be-
fought them again and again for our
fruits, till at laſt ſome other people that
were in the houſe aſked if we would be
contented

<page 275>

ſ 240
contented if they kept one bag and
gave us the other two. We, ſeeing no
remedy whatever, conſented to this;
and they, obſerving one bag to have
both kinds of fruit in it, which be-
longed to my companion, kept that:
and the other two, which were mine
they gave us back. As ſoon as I got
them, I ran as faſt as I could, and
got the firſt negro man I could to help
me off; my companion, however, ſtay-
ed a little longer to plead; he told
them the bag they had was his, and
likewiſe all that he was worth in the
world; but this was of no avail, and he
was obliged to return without it. The
poor old man wringing his hands, cri-
ed bitterly for his loſs; and, indeed,
he then did look up to God on high,
which ſo moved me with pity for him,
that I gave him nearly one third of
my fruits. We then proceeded to the
markets to ſell them; and Providence
was

<page 276>


I 241
was more favourable to us than we
could have expected, for we ſold our
fruits uncommonly well; I got for mine
about thirty-ſeven bits. Such a fur-
priſing reverſe of fortune in ſo ſhort
a ſpace of time ſeemed like a dream,
and proved no ſmall encouragement
for me to truſt the Lord in any ſitua-
tion. My captain afterwards fre-
quently uſed to take my part, and get
me my right, when I have been plun-
dered or uſed ill by theſe tender Chriſ.
tian depredators; among whom I have
ſhuddered to obſerve the unceaſing
blaſphemous execrations which are wan-
tonly thrown out by perſons of allages
and conditions, not only without oc-
caſion, but even as if they were indul-
gences and pleaſure.
At one of our trips to St. Kitt's, I
had eleven bits of my own; and my
friendly captain lent me five more,
with

<page 277>

[ 242 J
with which I bought a Bible. I was
very glad to get this book, which I
fearcely could meet with any where.
I think there was none ſold in Mont-
ſerrat; and, much to my grief, from
being forced out of the AEtna in the
manner I have related, my Bible, and
the Guide to the Indians, the two books
I loved above all others, were left
behind.
While I was in this place, St. Kitt's,
a very curious impoſition on human
nature took place: – A white man
wanted to marry in the church a free
black woman that had land and ſlaves
in Montſerrat; but the clergyman told
him it was againſt the law of the place
to marry a white and a black in the
church. The man then aſked to be
married on the water, to which the
parſon conſented, and the two lovers
went in one boat, and the parſon and
2 clerk

<page 278>

| 243
clerk in another, and thus the cere-
mony was performed. After this the
loving pair came on board our veſſel,
and my captain treated them extreme-
ly well, and brought them ſafe to
Montſerrat.
The reader cannot but judge of the
irkſomeneſs of this ſituation to a mind
like mine, in being daily expoſed to
new hardſhips and impoſitions, after
having ſeen many better days, and
been as it were, in a ſtate of free-
dom and plenty; added to which,
every part of the world I had hitherto
been in, ſeemed to me a paradiſe in
compariſon of the Weſt Indies. My
mind was therefore hourly replete with
inventions and thoughts of being freed,
and, if poſſible, by honeſt and honour-
able means; for I always remembered
the old adage; and I truſt it has ever
been my ruling principle, that “Ho-
M 2 ſ: neſty


<page 279>

244
“neſty is the beſt policy;” and likewiſe
that other golden precept—“To do
“unto all men as I would they ſhould
“do unto me.” However, as I was
from early years a predeſtinarian, I
thought whatever fate had determined
muſt ever come to paſs; and there-
fore, if ever it were my lot to be freed
nothing could prevent me, although I
ſhould at preſent ſee no means or hope
to obtain my freedom; on the other.
hand, if it were my fate not to be freed
I never ſhould be ſo, and all my en-
deavours for that purpoſe would be
fruitleſs. In the midſt of theſe thoughts
I therefore looked up with prayers
anxiouſly to God for my liberty; and
at the ſame time uſed every honeſt
means, and did all that was poſſible
on my part to obtain it. In proceſs of
time Ibecame maſter of a few pounds,
and in a fair way of making more, which
my

<page 280>

[ 245

my friendly captain knew very well;
this occaſioned him ſometimes to take
liberties with me; but whenever he
treated me waſpiſhly I uſed plainly to
tell him my mind, and that I would
die before I would be impoſed upon as
other negroes were, and that to me life
had loſt its reliſh when liberty was gone.
This I ſaid although I foreſaw my then
well-being or future hopes of freedom
(humanly ſpeaking) depended on this -
man. However, as he could not bear
the thoughts of my not failing with
him, he always became mild on my
threats. I therefore continued with
him; and, from my great attention to
his orders and his buſineſs, I gained
him credit, and through his kindneſs to
mel atlaſt procured my liberty. While
I thus wenton, filled with the thoughts
of freedom, and reſiſting oppreſſion as
well as I was able, my life hung daily
M 3 in

[ 246
in ſuſpence, particularly in the ſurfs F.
have formerly mentioned, as I could
not ſwim. Theſe are extremely violent
throughout the Weſt Indies, and I was
ever expoſed to their howling rage and
devouring fury in all the iſlands. I
have ſeen them ſtrike and toſs a boat
right up an end, and maim ſeveral on
board. Once in the Grenada iſlands,
when I and about eight others were
pulling a large boat with two pun-
cheons of water in it, a ſurf ſtruckus,
and drove the boat and all in it about
half a ſtone's throw, among ſome trees,
and above the high water mark. We
were obliged to get all the aſſiſtance we
could from the neareſteſtate tomend the
boat, and launchitinto the water again.
At Montſerratone night, in preſſinghard
to get off the ſhore on board, the punt
was overſet with us four times; the firſt
time I was very near being drowned;
however

<page 282>

[ 247 J
however the jacket I had on kept me
up above water a little ſpace of time,
while I called on a man near me who
was a good ſwimmer, and told him
I could not ſwim ; he then made haſte
to me, and, juſt as I was ſinking, he
caught hold of me, and brought me
to ſounding, and then he went and
brought the punt alſo. As ſoon as we
had turned the water out of her, left
we ſhould be uſed ill for being abſent,
we attempted again three times more,
and as often the horrid ſurfs ſerved us
as at firſt; but at laſt, the fifth time
we attempted, we gained our point,
at the eminent hazard of our lives.
One day alſo, at Old Road in Mont-
ſerrat, our captain, and three men be-
ſides myſelf, were going in a large
canoe in queſt of rum and ſugar,
when a fingle ſurf toſſed the canoe
an amazing diſtance from the water,
M 4 and

<page 283>

248
and ſome of us, near a ſtone's throw
from each other: moſt of us were very
much bruiſed; ſo that I and many
more often ſaid, and really thought,
that there was not ſuch another place
under the heavens as this. I longed
therefore much to leave it, and daily
wiſhed to ſeemy maſter’s promiſe per-
formed of going to Philadelphia.
While welay in this placea very cruel
thing happened on board of our ſloop
which filled me with horror; though I
found afterwards ſuch practices were
frequent. There was a very clever and
decent free young mulatto-man who
failed a long time with us: he had a
free woman for his wife, by whom he
had a child; and ſhe was then living
on ſhore, and all very happy. Our
captain and mate, and other people on
board, and ſeveral elſewhere, even the
natives of Bermudas, all knew this
young


<page 284>

[ 249 J
young man from a child that he was
always free, and no one had ever
claimed him as their property: how-
ever, as might too often overcomes
right in theſe parts, it happened that
a Bermudas captain, whoſe veſſel lay
there for a few days in the road, came
on board of us, and ſeeing the mulatto-
man, whoſe name was Joſeph Clipſon,
he told him he was not free, and that
he had orders from his maſter to bring
him to Bermudas. The poor man
could not believe the captain to be in
earneſt; but he was very ſoon unde-
ceived, his men laying violent hands on
him; and although he ſhewed a certi-
ficate of his being born free in St.
Kitt's, and moſt people on board knew
that he ſerved his time to boat-build-
ing, and always paſſed for a free man,
yet he was forcibly taken out of our
veſſel. He then aſked to be carried
- aſhore




<page 285>

| 25o J
aſhore before the ſecretary or magiſ-
trates, and theſe infernal invaders of
human rights promiſed him he ſhould;
but, inſtead of that, they carried him
on board of the other veſſel: and the
next day, without giving the poor man
any hearing on ſhore, or ſuffering him
even to ſee his wife or child, he was
carried away, and probably doomed
never more in this world to ſee them
again. Nor was this the only inſtance
of this kind of barbarity I was a wit-
neſs to. I have ſince often ſeen in
Jamaica and other iſlands, free men,
whom I have known in America, thus
villainouſly trepanned and held in bon-
dage. I have heard oftwo ſimilar prac-
tices even in Philadelphia; and were
it not for the benevolence of the quak-
ers in that city, many of the ſable race,
who now breathe the air of liberty,
would, I believe, be groaning indeed
under

<page 286>

[ 251 |
under ſome planter's chains. Theſe
things opened my mind to a new ſcene
of horror to which I had been before a
ſtranger. Hitherto Ihad thought only
ſlavery dreadful; but the ſtate of a
free negro appeared to me now equally
ſo at leaſt, and in ſome reſpects even
worſe, for they live in conſtant alarm
for their liberty; which is but nomi-
mal, for they are univerſally inſult-
ed and plundered without the poſſibi-
lity of redreſs; for ſuch is the equity
of the Weſt Indian laws, that no free
negro's evidence will be admitted in
their courts of juſtice. In this ſituation
isit ſurpriſing that ſlaves, when mildly
treated, ſhould prefer even the miſery
of ſlavery to ſuch a mockery of free-
dom? I was now completely diſguſted
with the Weſt Indies, and thought I
never ſhould be entirely free until I
had left them.

“With thoughtslike theſemy anxious boding mind

* Scenes where fair Liberty in bright array
* Makes darkneſs bright, and een illumines day;
“Where nor complexion, wealth, or ſtation, can

I determined to make every exertion
to obtain my freedom, and to return
to Old England. For this purpoſe I
thought a knowledge of navigation
might be of uſe to me; for, though I
did not intend to run away unleſs I
ſhould be ill uſed; yet, in ſuch a caſe,
if I underſtood navigation, I might
attempt my eſcape in our ſloop, which
was one of the ſwifteſt ſailing veſſels in
the Weſt Indies, and I could be at no

therefore employed themate of our veſ-
ſel to teach me navigation, for which I
agreed to give him twenty-four dollars,
and actually paid him partofthe money
down; though when the captain, ſome
time after, came to know that the mate
was to have ſuch a ſum for teaching
me, he rebuked him, and ſaid it was
a ſhame for him to take any money
from me. However, my progreſs in
this uſeful art was much retarded by
the conſtancy of our work. Had I
wiſhed to run away I did not wantop-
portunities, which frequently preſented
themſelves; and particularly at one
time, ſoon after this. When we were
at the iſland of Gaurdeloupe there was
a large fleet of merchantmen bound
for Old France; and, ſeamen then be
ing very ſcarce, they gave from fifteen
to twenty pounds a man for the run.
Our mate, and all the white ſailors,

left our veſſel on this account, and
went on board of the French ſhips.
They would have had me alſo to go
with them, for they regarded me;
and ſwore to protect me, if I would
go: and, as the fleet was to ſail the
next day, I really believe I could have
got ſafe to Europe at that time. How-
ever, as my maſter was kind, I would
not attempt to leave him; ſtill re-
membering the old maxim, that ‘ho-
neſty is the beſt policy,” I ſuffered
them to go without me. Indeed my
captain was much afraid of my leaving
him and the veſſel at that time, as I had
ſo fair an opportunity: but, I thank
God, this fidelity of mine turned out
much to my advantage hereafter, when
I did not in the leaſt think of it; and
made me ſo much in favour with the
captain, that he uſed now and then to

himſelf; but ſome of our paſſengers,
and others, ſeeing this, found much
fault with him for it, ſaying it was a
very dangerous thing to let a negro
know navigation; thus I was hindered
again in my purſuits. About the lat-
ter end of the year 1764, my maſter
bought a larger ſloop, called the Pru-º
dence, about ſeventy or eighty tons,
of which my captain had the com-
mand. I went with him into this veſ.
ſel, and we took a load of new ſlaves
for Georgia and Charles Town. My -
maſter now left me entirely to the
captain, though he ſtill wiſhed for me
to be with him; but I, who always
much wiſhed to loſe fight of the Weſt
Indies, was not a little rejoiced at the
thoughts of ſeeing any other country.
Therefore, relying on the goodneſs of
my captain, I got ready all the little
venture I could; and, when the veſſel

was ready, we ſailed to my great joy.
When we got to our deſtined places,
Georgia and Charles Town, I expect-
ed I ſhould have an opportunity of
ſelling my little property to advantage:
but here, particularly in Charles Town,
I met with buyers, white men, who
impoſed on me as in other places.
Notwithſtanding, I was reſolved to
have fortitude; thinking no lot or trial
too hard when kind Heaven is the
rewarder. -
We ſoon got loaded again, and
returned to Montſerrat; and there,
amongſt the reſt of the iſlands, I ſold
my goods well; and in this manner I
continued trading during the year 1764;
meeting with various ſcenes of impo-
ſition, as uſual. After this, my maſter
fitted out his veſſel for Philadelphia,
in the year 1765; and during the time
we were loading her, and getting
ready


<page 292>

[ 257
ready for the voyage, I worked with
redoubled alacrity, from the hope of
getting money enough by theſe voyages
to buy my freedom, in time, if it ſhould
pleaſe God; and alſo to ſee the town
of Philadelphia, which I had heard a
great deal about for ſome years paſt;
beſides which, I had always longed
to prove my maſter's promiſe the firſt
day I came to him. In the midſt of
theſe elevated ideas, and while I was
about getting my little merchandize
in readineſs, one Sunday my maſter
ſent for me to his houſe. When I
came there I found him and the cap-
tain together; and, on my going in, I
was ſtruck with aſtoniſhment at his
telling me he heard that I meant to run
away from him when I got to Phila-
delphia: ‘And therefore, ſaid he, ‘I
muſt ſell you again: you coſt me a
great deal of money, no leſs than
forty

*forty pounds ſterling; and it will
‘not do to loſe ſo much. You are a
* valuable fellow, continued he, and
‘I can get any day for you one hun-
‘dred guineas, from many gentlemen
“in this iſland.’ And then he told
me of Captain Doran's brother-in-law,
a ſevere maſter, who ever wanted to
buy me to make me his overſeer. My
captain alſo ſaid he could get much
more than a hundred guineas for me.
in Carolina. This I knew to be a fact;
for the gentleman that wanted to buy
me came off ſeveral times on board of
us, and ſpoke to me to live with him,
and ſaid he would uſe me well. When
I aſked what work he would put meto,
he ſaid, as I was a ſailor, he would
make me a captain of one of his rice
veſſels. But I refuſed: and fearing
at the ſame time, by a ſudden turn I
ſaw in the captain's temper, he might

I would not live with him on any con-
dition, and that I certainly would run

cruelly he would ſerve me if I ſhould
do ſo. My captain, however, gave
him to underſtand that I knew ſome-
thing of navigation: ſo he thought
better of it; and, to my great joy,
he went away. I now told my maſter
I did not ſay I would run away in Phi-
ladelphia; neither did I mean it, as he
did not uſe me ill, nor yet the captain:
for if they did I certainly would have
made ſome attempts before now ; but
as I thought that if it were God’s will
I ever ſhould be freed it would be ſo,
and, on the contrary, if it was not his
will it would not happen; ſo I hoped,

I 260
well, it ſhould be by honeſt means;
but as I could not help myſelf, he
muſt do as he pleaſed; I could only
hope and truſt to the God of Heaven:
and at that inſtant my mind was big
with inventions and full of ſchemes to
eſcape. I then appealed to the cap-
tain whether he ever ſaw any ſign of
my making the leaſt attempt to run
away; and aſked him if I did not al-
ways come on board according to the
time for which he gave me liberty;
and, more particularly, when all our
men left us at Gaurdeloupe and went
on board of the French fleet, and ad-
viſed me to go with them, whether I
might not, and that he could not have
got me again. To my no ſmall ſur-
priſe, and very great joy, the captain
confirmed every ſyllable that I had
ſaid : and even more: for he ſaid he
had tried different times to ſee if I
would

<page 296>

| 261
would make any attempt of this kind,
both at St. Euſtatia and in America,
and he never found that I made the
ſmalleſt; but on the contrary, I al-
ways came on board according to his
orders; and he did really believe, if
I ever meant to run away, that, as I
could never have had a better opportu-
nity, I would have done it the night
the mate and all the people left our
veſſel at Gaurdeloupe. The captain
then informed my maſter, who had
been thus impoſed on by our mate,
(though I did not know who was my
ememy,) the reaſon the mate had for
impoſing this lie upon him; which
was, becauſe I had acquainted the cap-
tain of the proviſions the mate had
given away or taken out of the veſſel.
This ſpeech of the captain was like life
to the dead to me, and inſtantly my
foul glorified God; and ſtill more ſo

ºn hearing my maſter immediately ſay
that I was a ſenſible fellow, and he ne-
wer did intend to uſe me as a common
Ilave; and that but for the entreaties
of the captain, and his character of me,
he would not have let me go from the
ſtores about as I had done: that alſo,
in ſo doing, he thought by carrying
one little thing or other to different
places to ſell I might make money.
That he alſo intended to encourage me
in this, by crediting me with half a
puncheon of rum and half a hogſhead
of ſugar at a time; ſo that, from being
careful, I might have money enough,
in ſome time, to purchaſe my freedom;
and, when that was the caſe, I might
depend upon it he would let me have
it for forty pounds ſterling money,
which was only the ſame price he gave
for me. This ſound gladdened my
poor heart beyond meaſure; though
indeed

<page 298>

| 263
indeed it was no more than the very
idea I had formed in my mind of my
maſter long before, and I immediately
made him this reply: ‘Sir, l always
had that very thought of you, indeed
* I had, and that made me ſo diligent
“in ſerving you.’ He then gave me
a large piece of ſilver coin, ſuch as I
never had ſeen or had before, and told
me to get ready for the voyage, and
he would credit me with a tierce of
ſugar, and another of rum; he alſo
ſaid that he had two amiable ſiſters in
Philadelphia, from whom I might get
ſome neceſſary things. Upon this my
noble captain deſired me to go aboard;
and, knowing the African metal, he
charged me not to ſay any thing of
this matter to any body; and he pro-
miſed that the lying mate ſhould not
go with him any more. This was a
change indeed; in the ſame hour to
feel

<page 299>
| 264
feel the moſt exquiſite pain, and in
the turn of a moment the fulleſt joy.
It cauſed in me ſuch ſenſations as I
was only able to expreſs in my looks;
my heart was ſooverpowered with gra-
titude that I could have kiſſed both of
their feet. When I left the room lim-
mediately went, or rather flew, to the
veſſel, which being loaded, my maſter,
as good as his word, truſted me with a
tierce of rum, and another of ſugar,
when we ſailed, and arrived ſafe at
the elegant town of Philadelphia. I
ſoon ſold my goods here pretty well;
and in this charming place I found
everything plentiful and cheap.
While I was in this place a very
extraordinary occurrence befellme. I
had been told one evening of a wiſe
woman, a Mrs. Davis, who revealed fe-
crets, foretold events, &c. I put little
faith in this ſtory at firſt, as I could
not


<page 300>

[ 265
not conceive that any mortal could
foreſee the future diſpoſals of Pro-
vidence, nor did I believe in any other
revelation than that of the Holy Scrip-
tures; however, I was greatly aſtoniſh-
ed at ſeeing this woman in a dream
that night, though a perſon I never
before beheld in my life; this made
ſuch an impreſſion on me, that I could
not get the idea the next day out of my
mind, and I then became as anxious to
ſee her as I was before indifferent; ac- -
cordingly in the evening, after we left
off working, I inquired where ſhe
lived, and being directed to her, to my
inexpreſſible ſurpriſe, beheld the very
woman in the very ſame dreſs ſhe ap-
peared to me to wear in the viſion.
She immediately told me I had dream-
ed of her the preceding night; related
to me many things that had happened
Vol. I. - N with

<page 301>

[ 266
with a correctneſs that aſtoniſhed me;
and finally told me I ſhould not be
long a ſlave: this was the more agree-
able news, as I believed it the more
readily from her having ſo faithfully
related the paſt incidents of my life.
She ſaid I ſhould be twice in very
great danger of my life within eigh-
teen months, which, if I eſcaped, I
fhould afterwards go on well; ſo, giv-
ing me her bleſfing, we parted. After
ſtaying here ſome time till our veſſel
was loaded, and I had bought in my
little traffic, we ſailed from this agree-
able ſpot for Montſerrat, once more to
encounter the raging ſurfs.
We arrived ſafe at Montſerrat,
where we diſcharged our cargo; and
ſoon after that we took ſlaves on board
for St. Euſtatia, and from thence to
Georgia. I had always exerted myſelf
and did double works in order to

make our voyages as ſhort as poſſible;
and from thus overworking myſelf
while we were at Georgia I caught a
fever and ague. I was very ill for
eleven days and near dying; eternity
was now exceedingly impreſſed on my
mind, and I feared very much that
awful event. I prayed the Lord there-
fore to ſpare me; and I made a pro-
miſe in my mind to God, that I would
be good if ever I ſhould recover. At
length, from having an eminent doc-
tor to attend me, I was reſtored again
to health; and ſoon after we got the
veſſel loaded, and ſet off for Mont-
ſerrat. During the paſſage, as I was
perfectly reſtored, and had much bu-
fineſs of the veſſel to mind, all my en-
deavours to keep up my integrity, and
perform my promiſe to God, began to
fail; and, in ſpite of all I could do,
as we drew nearer and nearer to the
N 2 iſlands,

iſlands, my reſolutions more and more
declined, as if the very air of that
country or climate ſeemed fatal to
piety. When we were ſafe arrived at
Montſerrat, and I had got aſhore, I for-
got my former reſolutions.—Alas! how
prone is the heart to leave that God it
wiſhes to love! and how ſtrongly do
the things of this world ſtrike the ſenſes
and captivate the ſoul!—After our veſ-
ſel was diſcharged, we ſoon got her rea-
dy, and took in, as uſual, ſome of the
poor oppreſſed natives of Africa, and
other negroes; we then ſet off again for
Georgia and Charleſtown. We arriv-
ed at Georgia, and, having landed part
of our cargo, proceeded to Charleſ-
town with the remainder. While we
were there I ſaw the town illuminated;
the guns were fired, and bonfires and
other demonſtrations of joy ſhewn, on
account of the repeal of the ſtamp

aft. Here I diſpoſed of ſome goods
on my own account; the white men
buying them with ſmooth promiſes and
fair words, giving me, however, but
very indifferent payment. There was
one gentleman particularly who bought
a puncheon of rum of me, which
gave me a great deal of trouble; and,
although I uſed the intereſt of my
friendly captain, I could not obtain any
thing for it; for, being a negro man, I
could not oblige him to pay me. This
vexed me much, not knowing how
to act; and I loſt ſometime in ſeeking
after this Chriſtian; and though, when
the Sabbath came (which the negroes
uſually make their holiday) I was much
inclined to go to public worſhip, I
was obliged to hire ſome black men
to help to pull a boat acroſs the water
to goinqueſt of this gentleman. When
I found him, after much entreaty, both

from myſelf and my worthy captain,
he at laſt paid me in dollars; ſome of
them, however, were copper, and of
conſequence of no value; but he took
advantage of my being a negro man,
and obliged me to put up with thoſe
or none, although I objected to them.
Immediately after, as I was trying
to paſs them in the market, amongſt
other white men, I was abuſed for of.

ſhewed them the man I got them from,
I was within one minute of being tied
up and flogged without either judge or
jury; however, by the help of a good
pair of heels, I ran off, and ſo eſcaped
the baſtinadoes I ſhould have received.
I got on board as faſt as I could, but
ftill continued in fear of them until we
failed, which I thanked God we did
not long after; and I have never been
amongſt them ſince. - -
We

<page 306>

[ 271 J
We ſoon came to Georgia, where we
were to complete our lading; and here
worſe fate than ever attended me: for
one Sunday night, as I was with ſome
negroes in their maſter's yard in the
town of Savannah, it happened that
their maſter, one Doctor Perkins, who
was a very ſevere and cruel man, came
in drunk; and not liking to ſee any
ftrange negroes in his yard, he and a
ruffian of a white man, he had in his
ſervice, beſet me in an inſtant, and both.
of them ſtruck me with the firſt wea-
pons they could get hold of. I cried
out as long as I could for help and
mercy; but, though I gave a good
account of myſelf, and he knew my
captain, who lodged hard by him, it
was to no purpoſe. They beat and
mangled me in a ſhameful manner,
leaving me near dead. I loſt ſo much
blood from the wounds I received,
that


<page 307>

[ 272 )
that I lay quite motionleſs, and was ſo
benumbed that I could not feel any
thing for many hours. Early in the
morning they took me away to the
jail. As I did not return to the ſhip
all night, my captain, not knowing
where I was, and being uneaſy that I
did not then make my appearance, he
made inquiry after me; and, having
found where I was, immediately came
to me. As ſoon as the good man ſaw
me ſo cut and mangled, he could not
forbear weeping; he ſoon got me out
of jail to his lodgings, and immedi-
ately ſent for the beſt doctors in the
place, who at firſt declared it as their
opinion that I could not recover. My
captain on this went to all the lawyers
in the town for their advice, but they
told him they could do nothing for me
as I was a negro. He then went to

Cočtor Perkins, the hero w hohad van-

quiſhed me, and menaced him, ſwear-
ing he would be revenged of him,
and challenged him to fight.—But
cowardice is ever the companion of
cruelty—and the Doctor refuſed. How-
ever, by the ſkilfulneſs of one Doctor
Brady of that place, I began at laſt to
amend; but, although I was ſo fore and
bad with the wounds I had all over me
that I could not reſt in any poſture,
yet I was in more pain on account of
the captain's uneaſineſs about me than
I otherwiſe ſhould have been. The
worthy man nurſed and watched me
all the hours of the night; and I was,
through his attention and that of the
doctor, able to get out of bed in about
fixteen or eighteen days. All this
time I was very much wanted on
board, as I uſed frequently to go up
and down the river for rafts, and other
parts of our cargo, and ſtow them,

about four weeks I was able to go on
duty; and in a fortnight after, having
got in all our lading, our veſſel ſet ſail

weeks we arrived there ſafe towards
the end of the year. This ended my
adventures in 1764; for I did not leave
Montſerrat again till the beginning of
the following year.

VERY day now brought menearer
my freedom, and I was impatient
till we proceeded again to ſea, that I
might have an opportunity of getting a
ſum large enough to purchaſe it. I was
not long ungratified; for, in the begin-
ing of the year 1766, my maſter bought
another ſloop, named the Nancy, the
largeſt I had ever ſeen. She was partly
laden, and was to proceed to Philadel-
phia; our Captain had his choice of
three, and I was well pleaſed he choſe
this, which was the largeſt; for, from
his having a large veſſel, I had more
room, and could carry a larger quantity
of goods with me. Accordingly, when
we had delivered our old veſſel, the Pru-
dence, and completed the lading of
3 the

<page 320>

| 3 ||
the Nancy, having made near three
hundred per cent, by four barrels of
pork I brought from Charleſtown, Ilaid
in as large a cargo as I could, truſting
to God’s providence to proſper my un-
dertaking. With theſe views I ſailed
for Philadelphia. On our paſſage, when
we drew near the land, I was for the
firſt time ſurpriſed at the fight of ſome
whales, having never ſeen any ſuch
large ſea monſters before; and as we
failed by the land, one morning I ſaw
a puppy whale cloſe by the veſſel; it
was about the length of a wherry boat,
and it followed us all the day till we got
within the Capes. We arrived ſafe and
in good time at Philadelphia, and Iſold
my goods there chiefly to the quakers.
They always appeared to be a very ho-
neſt diſcreet fort of people, and never
attempted to impoſeon me; I therefore
liked them, and ever after choſe to deal

with them in preference to any others.
OneSunday morning while I was here,
as I was going to church, I chanced to
paſs a meeting-houſe. The doors being
open, and the houſe full of people, it
excited my curioſity to go in. When
I entered the houſe, to my great fur-
priſe, I ſaw a very tall woman ſtanding
in the midſt of them, ſpeaking in an au-
dible voice ſomething which I could not
underſtand. Having neverſeen anything
of this kind before, I ſtood and ſtared
about me for ſome time, wondering at
this odd ſcene. As ſoon as it was over,
I took an opportunity to make inquiry
about the place and people, when I was
informed they were called Quakers. I
particularly aſked what that woman I
ſaw in the midſt of them had ſaid, but
none of them were pleaſed to ſatisfy
me; ſo I quitted them, and ſoon after,
as I was returning, I came to a church
2 crowded


<page 322>

| 5 ||
crowded with people; the church-yard
was full likewiſe, and a number of
people were even mounted on ladders,
looking in at the windows. I thought
this a ſtrange fight, as I had never ſeen
churches, either in England or the Weſt
Indies, crowded in this manner before.
I therefore made bold to aſk ſome peo-
ple the meaning of all this, and they
told methe Rev. Mr. George Whitfield
was preaching. I had often heard of
this gentleman, and had wiſhed to ſee
and hear him; but I had never before
had an opportunity. I now therefore
reſolved to gratify myſelf with the fight,
and preſſed in amidſt the multitude.
When I got into the church I ſaw this
pious man exhorting the people with the
greateſt fervour and earneſtneſs, and
ſweating as much as I ever did while in
ſlavery on Montſerrat beach. I was
very much ſtruck and impreſſed with
B 3 this;

<page 323>

[ 6 J
this; I thought it ſtrange I had never
ſeen divines exert themſelves in this
manner before, and was no longer at
a loſs to account for the thin congre-
gations they preached to.
When we had diſchargedour cargohere
and were loaded again, weleſt this fruitful
land once more, and ſet ſail for Mont-
terrat. My traffic had hitherto ſuc-
ceeded ſo well with me, that I thought,
by ſelling my goods when we arrived
at Montſerrat, I ſhould have enough to
purchaſe my freedom. But as ſoon as
our veſſel arrived there, my maſter
came on board, and gave orders for us
to go to St. Euſtatia, and diſcharge our
cargo there, and from thence proceed
for Georgia. I was much diſappointed
at this; but thinking, as uſual, it was
of no uſe to encounter with the decrees
of fate, I ſubmitted without repining,

and we went to St. Euſtatia. After we
had


<page 324>

| 7 ||
had diſcharged our cargo there we took
in a live cargo, (as we call a cargo of
ſlaves.) Here I ſold my goods tolerably
well, but, not being able to lay out all
my money in this ſmall iſland to as
much advantage as in many other
places, I laid out only part, and the re-
mainder I brought away with me neat.
We ſailed from hence for Georgia, and
I was glad when we got there, though
I had not much reaſon to like the place
from my laſt adventure in Savannah;
but I longed to get back to Montſerrat
and procure my freedom, which I ex-
pected to be able to purchaſe when I
returned. As ſoon as we arrived here
I waited on my careful doctor, Mr.
Brady, to whom I made the moſt grate-
ful acknowledgments in my power for
his former kindneſs and attention during
my illneſs.
While we were here, an odd cir-
cumſtance happened to the Captain
B 4 and


<page 325>

[ s ]
and me, which diſappointed us both a
good deal. A filverſmith, whom we had
brought to this place ſome voyages be-
fore, agreed with the Captain to return
with us to the Weſt Indies, and pro-
miſed at the ſame time to give the
Captain a great deal of money, having
pretended to take a liking to him, and
being, as we thought, very rich. But
while we ſtayed to load our veſſel this
man was taken ill in a houſe where he
worked, and in a week's time became
very bad. The worſe he grew the
more he uſed to ſpeak of giving the
Captain what he had promiſed him, ſo
that he expected ſomething conſiderable
from the death of this man, who had no
wife or child, and he attended him day
and night. I uſed alſo to go with the
Captain, at his own deſire, to attend
him, eſpecially when we ſaw there was


no appearance of his recovery; and, in
order


<page 326>

[ 9 J
order to recompenſe me for my trouble,
the Captain promiſed me ten pounds,
when he ſhould get the man’s property.
I thought this would be of great ſervice
to me, although I had nearly money
enough to purchaſe my freedom, if I
ſhould getſafethis voyage to Montſerrat.
In this expectation I laid out above
eight pounds of my money for a ſuit of
ſuperfine clothes to dance in at my
freedom, which I hoped was then at
hand. We ſtill continued to attend this
man, and were with him even on the
laſt day he lived, till very late at night,
when we went on board. After we were
got to bed, about one or two o'clock
in the morning, the Captain was ſent
for, and informed the man was dead.
On this he came to my bed, and, wak-
ing me, informed me of it, and deſired
me to get up and procure a light, and
immediatelygowith him. I told him I
B 5 WaS

| Io J
was very ſleepy, and wiſhed he would
take ſomebody elſe with him; or elſe,
as the man was dead, and could want
no farther attendance, to let all things
remain as they were till the next morn-
ing. ‘No, no,” ſaid he, we will have
‘the money to-night, I cannot waittill
to-morrow; ſoletus go.” Accordingly
I got up and ſtruck a light, and away
we both went and ſaw the man as dead
as we could wiſh. The Captain ſaid he
would give him a grand burial, in gra-
titude for the promiſed treaſure; and
deſired that all the things belonging to
the deceaſed might be brought forth.
Among others, there was a neſt of
trunks of which he had kept the keys
whilſt the man was ill, and when they
were produced we opened them with no
ſmall eagerneſs and expectation; and
as there were a great number within
one another, with much impatience we
took


<page 328>

| 11 J
took them one out of the other. At
laſt, when we came to the ſmalleſt, and
had opened it, we ſaw it was full of pa-
pers, which we ſuppoſed to be notes; at
the fight of which our hearts leapt for
joy; and that inſtant the Captain, clap-
ping his hands, cried out, ‘Thank
* God, here it is.’ But when we took up
the trunk, and began to examine the
ſuppoſed treaſure and long-looked-for
bounty, (alas! alas ! how uncertain and
deceitful are all human affairs!) what
had we found? While we thought we
were embracing a ſubſtance we graſped
an empty nothing. The whole amount
that was in the neſt of trunks, was only
one dollar and a half; and all that the
man poſſeſſed would not pay for his
coffin. Our ſudden and exquiſitejoy was
now ſucceeded by as ſudden and exqui-
ſite pain; and my Captain and I ex-
hibited, for ſometime, moſt ridiculous

[ 12 J
figures—pictures of chagrin and diſap-
pointment! We went away greatly mor-
tified, and left the deceaſed to do as
well as he could for himſelf, as we had
taken ſo good care of him when alive
for nothing. We ſet ſail once more for
Montſerrat, and arrived there ſafe; but
much out of humour with our friend the
ſilverſmith. When we had unladen the
veſſel, and I had ſold my venture, find-
ing myſelf maſter of about forty-ſeven
pounds—I conſulted my true friend, the
Captain, how I ſhould proceedin offer-
ing my maſter the money for my free-
dom. He told me to come on a certain
morning, when he and my maſter would
beat breakfaſt together. Accordingly,
on that morning I went, and met the
Captain there, as he had appointed.
When I went in I made my obeiſance
to my maſter, and with my money in
my hand, and many fears in my heart,
I

<page 330>

| 13 J
I prayed him to be as good as his offer
to me, when he was pleaſed to promiſe
me my freedom as ſoon as I could pur-
chaſe it. This ſpeech ſeemed to con–
found him; he began to recoil; and
my heart that inſtant funk within me.
“What, ſaid he, ‘give you your free-
dom? Why, where did you get the
money? Have you got forty-pounds
ſterling * * Yes, ſir, I anſwered.
• How did you get it?’ replied he. I
told him, very honeſtly. The Cap-
tain then ſaid he knew I got the mo–
ney very honeſtly and with much in-
duſtry, and that I was particularly
careful. On which my maſter replied,
I got money much faſter than he did;
and ſaid he would not have made me
the promiſe he did if he had thought I
ſhould have got money ſo ſoon. Come,
‘come, ſaid my worthy Captain, clap-
ping my maſter on the back, “Come,
* Robert,


<page 331>

[ 14 J
“Robert, (which was his name). I
“think you muſt let him have his free-
‘dom –you have laid your money out
‘very well; you have received good

“is now the principal at laſt. I know
* Guſtavas has earned you more than
“an hundred a-year, and he will ſtill
“ſave you money, as he will not leave
“you :—Come, Robert, take the mo-
ºney.’ My maſter then ſaid, he would
not be worſe than his promiſe; and,
taking the money, told me to go to
the Secretary at the Regiſter Office,
and get my manumiſſion drawn up.
Theſe words of my maſter were like
a voice from heaven to me: in an in-
ſtant all mytrepidation was turned into
unutterable bliſs; and I moſt reverently
bowed myſelf with gratitude, unable to
expreſs my feelings, but by the over-
flowing of my eyes, and a heart replete

with


<page 332>

[ 15 J
with thanks to God; whilemy true and
worthy friend the Captain, congratu-
lated us both with a peculiar degree of
heart-felt pleaſure. As ſoon as the firſt
tranſports of my joy were over, and that
I had expreſſed my thanks to theſe my
worthy friends in the beſt manner I was
able, I roſe with a heart full of affec-
tion and reverence, and left the room,
in order to obey my maſter's joyful
mandate of going to the Regiſter Of-
fice. As I was leaving the houſe I
called to mind the words of the Pſalmiſt,
in the 126th Pſalm, and like him, ‘I
“glorified God in my heart, in whom I
truſted.’ Theſe words had been im-
preſſed on my mind from the very day
I was forced from Deptford to the pre-
ſent hour, and I now ſaw them, as I
thought, fulfilled and verified. My
imagination was all rapture as I flew to
the Regiſter Office; and, in this reſpect,
like

ſ 16 J
like the apoſtle Peter,” (whoſe deliver-
ance from priſon was ſo ſudden and ex-
traordinary, that he thought he was in
a viſion) I could ſcarcely believe I was
awake. Heavens! who could do juſ-
tice to my feelings at this moment! Not
conquering heroes themſelves, in the
midſt of a triumph–Not the tender
mother who has juſt regained her long-
loſt infant, and preſſes it to her heart–
Not the weary hungry mariner, at the
ſight of the deſired friendly port–Not
the lover, when he once more embraces
his beloved miſtreſs, after ſhe has been
raviſhed from his arms –All within
my breaſt was tumult, wildneſs, and
delirium! My feet ſcarcely touched the
ground, for they were winged with joy,
and, like Elijah, as he roſe to Heaven,
they were with lightning ſped as
went on. Every one I met I told of

my happineſs, and blazed about the vir-
tue of my amiable maſter and captain.
When I gotto the office and acquaint-
ed the Regiſter with my errand, he
congratulated me on the occaſion, and
told me he would draw up my manu-
miſſion for half price, which was a
guinea. I thanked him for his kind-
neſs; and, having received it and paid
him, Ihaſtened to my maſter to get him
to ſignit, that I might be fully releaſed.
Accordingly he ſigned the manumiſſion
that day; ſo that, before night, I who
had been a ſlave in the morning, trem-
bling at the will of another, was become
my own maſter, and completely free. I
thought this was the happieſt day I had
ever experienced; and my joy was ſtill
heightened by the bleſfings and prayers
of many of the ſable race, particularly
the aged, to whom my heart had ever
been attached with reverence.

In ſhort, the fair as well as black
people immediately ſtyled me by a new
appellation, to me the moſt deſirable in
the world, which was Freeman, and at
the dances I gave, my Georgia ſuper-
fine blue clothes made no indifferent
appearance as I thought. Some of the
fable females, who formerly ſtood aloof,
now began to relax and appear leſs coy;
but my heart was ſtill fixed on London,
where I hoped to be ere long. So
that my worthy captain and his owner
my late maſter, finding that the bent of
my mind was towards London, ſaid to
me, ‘We hope you won’t leave us, but
“that you will ſtill be with the veſſels.”
Here gratitude bowed me down; and
none but the generous mind can judge
of my feelings, ſtruggling between in-
clination and duty. However, not-
withſtanding my wiſh to be in London,
I obediently anſwered my benefactors
that


<page 338>

| 21 |
that I would go in the veſſel, and not
leave them; and from that day I was
entered on board as an able-bodied
ſailor, at thirty-ſix ſhillings per month,
beſides what perquiſites I could make.
My intention was to make a voyage or
two, entirely to pleaſe theſe my ho-
noured patrons; but I determined that
the year following, if it pleaſed God, I
would ſee Old England once more, and
ſurpriſe my old maſter, Capt. Paſcal,
who was hourly in my mind; for I ſtill
loved him, notwithſtanding his uſage
of me, and I pleaſed myſelf with think-
ing of what he would ſay when he ſaw
what the Lord had done for me in ſo
ſhort a time, inſtead of being, as he
might perhaps ſuppoſe, under the cruel
yoke of ſome planter. With theſe kind
of reveries I uſed often to entertain my-
ſelf, and ſhorten the time till my return;
and now, being as in my original free
African

<page 339>

| 22
African ſtate, I embarked on board the
Nancy, after having got all things
ready for our voyage. In this ſtate of
ſerenity we ſailed for St. Euſtatia; and
having ſmooth ſeas and calm weather,
we ſoon arrived there: after taking our
cargo on board, we proceeded to Sa-
vannah in Georgia, in Auguſt, 1766.
While we were there, as uſual, I uſed to
go for the cargo up the rivers in boats;
and on this buſineſs have been fre-
quently beſet by Alligators, which were
very numerous on that coaſt; and
ſhot many ofthem when they have been
near getting into our boats; which we
have with great difficulty ſometimes
prevented, and have been very much
frightened at them. I have ſeen a
young one ſold in Georgia alive for
fixpence.
During our ſtay at this place,
one evening a ſlave belonging to Mr.
Read

<page 340>

[ 23 J
Read, a merchant of Savannah, came
near our veſſel, and began to uſe me
very ill. I entreated him, with all the
patience I was maſter of, to deſiſt, as I
knew there was little or no law for a
free negro here; but the fellow, inſtead
of taking my advice, perſevered in his
inſults, and even ſtruck me. At this I
loſt all temper, and fell on him and
beat him ſoundly. The next morning
his maſter came to our veſſel as we lay
alongſide the wharf, and deſired me
to come aſhore that he might have me
flogged all round the town, for beating
his negro ſlave. I told him he had in-
ſulted me, and had given the provo-
cation, by firſt ſtriking me. I had told
my captain alſo the whole affair that
morning, and wiſhed him to have gone
along with me to Mr. Read, to prevent
bad conſequences; but he ſaid that it
did not ſignify, and if Mr. Read ſaid

any.


<page 341>

| 24 J
anything he would make matters up,
and deſired me to go to work, which
I accordingly did. The Captain be-
ing on board when Mr. Read came
and applied to him to deliver me up, he
ſaid he knew nothing of the matter, I
was a free man. I was aſtoniſhed and
frightened at this, and thought I had
better keep where I was than go aſhore
and be flogged round the town, with-
out judge or jury. I therefore refuſed
to ſtir; and Mr. Read went away,
ſwearing he would bring all the con-
ftables in the town, for he would have
me out of the veſſel. When he was
gone, I thought his threat might prove
too true to my ſorrow; and I was con-
firmed in this belief, as well by the
many inſtances I had ſeen of the treat-
ment of free negroes, as from a fact
that had happened within my own
knowledge here a ſhort time before.
There

<page 342>

25
There was a free black man, a car-
penter, that I knew, who for aſking a.
gentleman that he worked for, for the
money he had earned, was put into
gaol; and afterwards this oppreſſed
man was ſent from Georgia, with falſe
accuſations, of an intention to ſet the
gentleman's houſe onfire, and runaway
with his ſlaves. I was therefore much
-
embarraſſed, and very apprehenſive of
a flogging at leaſt. I dreaded, of all
things, the thoughts of being ſtriped,
as I never in my life had the marks of
any violence of that kind. At that in-
ſtant a rage ſeized my ſoul, and for a
little I determined to reſiſt the firſt man
that ſhould offer to lay violent hands on
me, or baſely uſe me without a trial.
for I would ſooner die like a free man,
than ſuffer myſelf to be ſcourged by the
hands of ruffians, and my blood drawn
like a ſlave. The captain and others,
Vol. II. C -
in lore

<page 343>

ſ' 26 J
morecautious, adviſed me to make haſte
and conceal myſelf; for they ſaid Mr.
Read was a very ſpiteful man, and he
would ſoon come on board with con-
ſtables and take me. At firſt I refuſed
this counſel, being determined to ſtand
my ground; but at length, by the
prevailing entreaties of the captain
and Mr. Dixon, with whom he lodged,
I went to Mr. Dixon's houſe, which was
a little out of town, at a place called
Fea-ma-chra. I was but juſt gone
when Mr. Read, with the conſtables,
came for me, and ſearched the veſſel;
but, not finding me there, he ſwore he
would have me dead or alive. I was
ſecreted about five days; however, the
good character which my captain al-
ways gave me as well as ſome other
gentlemen who alſo knew me, procured
me ſome friends. Atlaſt ſome of them
told my captain that he did not uſe me
well,

<page 344>

[ 27, 1
well, in ſuffering me thus to be impoſed
upon, and ſaid they would ſee me re-
dreſſed, and get me onboard ſome other
veſſel. My captain, on this, immedi-
ately went to Mr. Read, and told him,
that ever ſince I eloped from the veſſel
his work had been neglected, and he
could not go on with herloading, him-
ſelf and mate not being well; and, as
I had managed things on board for
them, my abſence muſt retard his voyage,
and conſequently hurt the owner; he
therefore begged of him to forgive me,
as he ſaid henever heard any complaint
of me before, during the ſeveral years
had been with him. After repeated
entreaties, Mr. Read ſaid I might go
to hell, and that he would not meddle
with me; on which my captain came
immediately to me at his lodging, and,
telling me how pleaſantly matters had
gone on, deſired me to go on board.
C 2 Some

<page 345>

[ 28
Some of my other friends then aſked
him if he had got the conſtable's war-
rant from them; the captain ſaid, No.
On this I was deſired by them to ſtay
in the houſe; and they ſaid they would
get me on board of ſome other veſſel
before the evening. When the captain
heard this he became almoſt diſtracted.
He went immediately for the warrant,
and, after uſing every exertion in his
power, he at laſt got it from my hunt-
ers; but I had all the expences to pay.
After I had thanked all my friends for
their kindneſs, I went on board again
to my work, of which I had always
plenty. We were in haſte to complete
our lading, and were to carry twenty
head of cattle with us to the Weſt In-
dies, where they are a very profitable
article. In order to encourage me in
working, and to make up for the time
I had loſt, my captain promiſed me the
privilege of carrying two bullocks of
my

<page 346>

iſ 19 J
my own with me; and this made me
work with redoubled ardour. As ſoon
as I had got the veſſel loaded, in doing
which I was obliged to perform the du-
ty of the mate as well as my own work,
and that the bullocks were near com-
ing on board, I aſked the captain leave
to bring my two, according to his pro-
miſe; but, to my great ſurpriſe, he told
me there was no room for them. I
then aſked him to permit me to take
one; but he ſaid he could not. I was
a good deal mortified at this uſage, and
told him I had no notion that he in-
tended thus to impoſe on me; nor
could I think well of any man that was
ſo much worſe than his word. On
this we had ſome diſagreement, and I
gave him to underſtand, that I intended
to leave the veſſel. At this he appeared
to be very much dejected; and our mate
who had been very ſickly, and whoſe
C 3 duty


<page 347>

I go I
duty had long devolved upon me, ad-
viſed him to perſuade me to ſay: in
conſequence of which he ſpoke very
kindly to me, making many fair pro-
miſes, telling me, that, as the mate was
fo ſickly, he could not do without me;
and that, as the ſafety of the veſſeland
cargo depended greatly upon me, he
therefore hoped that I would not be
offended at what had paſſed between us,
andſwore he would make up all matters
when we arrived in the Weſt Indies;
ſo I conſented to ſlave on as before.
Soon after this, as the bullocks were
coming on board, one of them ran at
the captain, and butted him ſo furiouſly
in the breaſt, that he never recovered of
the blow. In order to make me ſome
amends for his treatment about the bul-
locks, the captain now preſſed ºne very
much to take ſome turkeys, and other
fowls, with me, and gave me liberty to
take

<page 348>

[ 31
take as many as I could find room for:
but I told him he knew very well I had
never carried any turkeys before, as
always thought they were ſuch tender
birds that they were not fit to croſs the
ſeas. However, he continued to preſs
me to buy them for once; and, what
ſeemed very ſurpriſing to me, the more
I was againſtit, the more he urged my
taking them, inſomuch that he enſured
me from all loſſes that might happen by
them, and I was prevailed on to take
them; but I thought this very ſtrange,
as he had never acted ſo with me be-
fore. This, and not being able to diſ-
poſe of my paper-money in any other
way, induced me at length to take four
dozen. The turkeys, however, I was
ſo diſſatisfied about that I determined
to make no more voyages to this quar-
ter, nor with this captain; and was
very apprehenſive that my free voyage
would be the worſt I had ever made.
C 4 We

we ſet fail for Montſerrat. The Cap-
tain and mate had been both complain-
ing of ſickneſs when we ſailed, and as
we proceeded on our voyage they grew
worſe. This was about November, and
we had not been long at ſea before we
began to meet with ſtrong northerly
gales and rough ſeas; and in about
ſeven or eight days all the bullocks
were near being drowned, and four or
five of them died. Our veſſel, which
had not been tight at firſt, was much
leſs ſo now: and, though we were but
nine in the whole, including five ſailors
and myſelf, yet we were obliged to at-
tend to the pumps every half or three
quarters of an hour. The captain and
mate came on deck as often asthey were
able, which was now but ſeldom ; for
they declined ſo faſt that they were not
well enough tomake obſervations above
four or five times the whole voyage.
The

<page 350>

I 33 ||
The whole care of the veſſel reſted,
therefore upon me, and I was obliged
to direct her by mere dint of reaſon,
not being able to work a traverſe. The
captain was now very ſorry he had not
taught me navigation, and proteſted, if
ever he ſhould get well again, he would
not fail to do ſo; but in about ſeven-
teen days his illneſs increaſed ſo much,
that he was obliged to keep his bed,
continuing ſenſible, however, till the
laſt, conſtantly having the owner's in-
tereſt at heart; for this juſt and bene-
volent man ever appeared much con-
cerned about the welfare of what he
was intruſted with. When this dear
friend found the ſymptoms of death ap-

thus exprefing my affection and forrow
by his bedſide, he expired without ſay-
ing another word; and the day follow-
ing we committed his body to the
deep. Every man on board loved
him, and regretted his death; but I
was exceedingly affected at it, and
found that I did not know, till he was
gone, the ſtrength of my regard for
him. Indeed I had every reaſon in the
world to be attached to him; for, be-
fides that he was in general mild, affa–
ble, generous, faithful, benevolent, and
juſt, he was to me a friend and father;
and had it pleaſed Providence, that he
had died but five months before, live-
rily believe I ſhould not have obtained
my freedom when I did; and it is not
improbable that I might not have been
able to get it at any rate afterwards.

The captain being dead, the mate
came on the deck, and made ſuch ob-
ſervations as he was able, but to no
purpoſe. In the courſe of a few days
more, the few bullocks that remained
were found dead; but the turkies I had,
though on the deck, and expoſed to ſo
much wet and bad weather, did well,
and I afterwards gained near three hun-
dred per cent, on the ſale of them; ſo
that in the event it proved a happy
circumſtance for me that I had not
bought the bullocks I intended, for
they muſt have periſhed with the reſt;
and I could not help looking on this,
otherwiſe trifling circumſtance, as a
particular providence of God, and
was thankful accordingly. The care of
the veſſel took up all my time, and en-
gaged my attention entirely. As we
were now out of the variable winds, I
thought I ſhould not be much puzzled to

ſteered right for Antigua, which I wiſh-
ed to reach, as the neareſt to us; and in
the courſe of nine or ten days we made
this iſland, to our great joy; and the
day after we came ſafe to Montſerrat.
Many were ſurpriſed when they
heard of my conducting the ſloop into
the port, and I now obtained a new ap-
pelation, and was called Captain. This
elated me not a little, and it was quite
flattering to my vanity to be thus ſtyled
by as high a title as any freeman in this
place poſſeſſed. When the death of the
captain became known, he was much
regretted by all who knew him; for he
was a man univerſally reſpected. At
the ſame time the ſable captain loſt
no fame; for the ſucceſs I had met
with increaſed the affection of my
friends in no ſmall meaſure.

As I had now, by the death of my
captain, loſt my great benefactor and
friend, I had little inducement to re-
main longer in the Weſt Indies, except
my gratitude to Mr. King, which I
thought I had pretty well diſcharged
in bringing back his veſſel ſafe, and
delivering his cargo to his ſatisfaction.
I began to think of leaving this part of
the world, of which I had been long
tired, and returning to England, where
my heart had always been ; but Mr.
King ſtill preſſed me very much to
ſtay with his veſſel; and he had done
ſo much for me that I found myſelf
unable to refuſe his requeſts, and con-
ſented to go another voyage to Georgia,
as the mate, from his ill ſtate of health,

was quite uſeleſs in the veſſel. Accord-
ingly a new captain was appointed,
whoſe name was William Phillips, an
old acquaintance of mine; and, having
refitted our veſſel, and taken ſeveral
ſlaves on board, we ſet ſail for St.
Euſtatia, where we ſtayed but a few
days; and on the 30th of January 1767,
weſteered for Georgia. Our new cap-
tain boaſted ſtrangely of his ſkill in
navigating and conducting a veſſel;
and in conſequence of this he ſteered a
new courſe, ſeveral points more to the
weſtward than we ever did before; this
appeared to me very extraordinary.
On the fourth of February, which
was ſoon after we had got into our new'
courſe, I dreamt the ſhip was wrecked
amidſt the ſurfs and rocks, and that I
was the means of ſaving every one on
board; and on the night following I
dreamed the very ſame dream. Theſe
dreams

<page 357>

[ 4o I
dreams however made no impreſſion on
my mind; and the next evening, it be-
ing my watch below, I was pumping
the veſſel a little after eight o'clock,
juſt before I went off the deck, as is
the cuſtom; and being weary with the
duty of the day, and tired at the pump,
(for we made a good deal of water)
I began to expreſs my impatience,
and uttered with an oath, Damn the
* veſſel’s bottom out.” But my con-
ſcience inſtantly ſmote me for the ex-
preſſion. When I left the deck I went
to bed, and had ſcarcely fallen aſleep
when I dreamed the ſame dream again
about the ſhip as I had dreamt the
two preceeding nights. At twelve
o'clock the watch was changed; and,
as I had always the charge of the cap-
tain's watch, I then went upon deck.
At half after one in the morning the
man at the helm ſaw ſomething under
the

theſee-beam that the ſeawaſhed againſt,
and he immediately called to me that
there was a grampus, and deſired me
to look at it. Accordingly I ſtood up
and obſerved it for ſome time; but,
when I ſaw the ſea waſh up againſt it
again and again, I ſaid it was not
a fiſh but a rock. Being ſoon certain
of this, I went down to the captain,
and, with ſome confuſion, told him the
danger we were in, and deſired him to
come upon deck immediately. He
ſaid it was very well, and I went up
again. As ſoon as I was upon deck,
the wind, which had been pretty high,
having abated a little, the veſſel began
to becarried ſideways towards the rock,
by means of the current. Still the
captain did not appear. I therefore
went to him again, and told him the
veſſel was then near a large rock, and
deſired he would come up withallſpeed.
- - He

<page 359>

42
He ſaid he would, and I returned to
the deck. When! was upon the deck
again I ſaw we were not above a pitol
fhot from the rººk, and I heard the
noiſe of the breakers all around us. I
was exceedingly alarmed at this; and
the captain having not yet come on the
deck I loſt all patience; and, growing
quite enraged, Iran downto him again,
and aſked him why he did not come
up, and what he could mean by all this?
* The breakers,” ſaid I, are round us,
* and the veſſel is almoſt on the rock.”
With that he came on the deck with
me, and we tried to put the veſſel
about, and get her out of the current,
but all to no purpoſe, the wind being
very ſmall. We then called all hands
up immediately, and after a little we
got up one end of a cable, and faſt-
ened it to the anchor. By this time
the ſurf was foamed round us, and
made

made a dreadful noiſe on the breakers,
and the very moment we let the an-
chorgo the veſſel ſtruck againſt the
rocks. One ſwell now ſucceeded an-
other, as it were one wave calling on
its fellow: the roaring of the billows
increaſed, and, with one ſingle heave
of the ſwells, the ſloop was pierced and
transfixed among the rocks! in a mo-
ment a ſcene of horror preſented itſelf
to my mind, ſuch as I never had con-
ceived or experienced before. All my
fins ſtared me in the face; and eſpe-
cially, I thought that God had hurled
his direful vengeance on my guilty
head for curſing the veſſel on which
my life depended. My ſpirits at this
forſook me, and I expected every mo-
ment to go to the bottom: I deter-
mined if I ſhould ſtill be ſaved that I
would never ſwear again. And in the
midſt of my diſtreſs, while the dreadful
ſurfs

<page 361>

I 44
ſurfs weredaſhing with unremitting fury
among the rocks, I remembered the
Lord, though fearful that I was unde-
ſerving of forgiveneſs, and I thought
that as he had often delivered he might
yet deliver; and, calling to mind the
many mercies he had ſhewn me in
times paſt, they gave me ſome ſmall
hope that he might ſtill help me. I
then began to think how we might be
ſaved; and I believe no mind was ever
like mine ſo replete with inventions
and confuſed with ſchemes, though
how to eſcape death I knew not. The
captainimmediately ordered the hatches -
to be nailed down on the ſlaves in the
hold, where there were above twenty,
all of whom muſt unavoidably have pe—
riſhed if he had been obeyed. When ,
he deſired the man to nail down the
hatches I thought that my ſin was the
cauſe of this, and that God would
charge

<page 362>

| 45
charge me with theſe people's blood.
This thought ruſhed upon my mind
that inſtant with ſuch violence, that it
quite overpowered me, and I ſainted.
I recovered juſt as the people were
about to nail down the hatches; per-
ceiving which, I deſired them to ſtop.
The captain then ſaid it muſt be done:
I aſked him why? He ſaid that every
one would endeavour to get into the
boat, which was but ſmall, and thereby
we ſhould be drowned; for it would
not have carried above ten at the moſt.
I could no longer reſtrain my emotion,
and I told him he deſerved drowning
for not knowing how to navigate the
veſſel; and I believe the people would
have toſſed him overboard if I had
given them the leaſt hint of it. How-
ever the hatches were not nailed down;
and, as none of us could leave the
veſſel then on account of the darkneſs,
and

<page 363>

[ 46
and as we knew not where to go, and
were convinced beſides that the boat
could not ſurvive the ſurfs, weall ſaid
we would remain on the dry part of
the veſſel, and truſt to God till day-
light appeared, when we ſhould know
better what to do.
I then adviſed to get the boat pre-
pared againſt morning, and ſome of us
began to ſet about it, but others aban-
doned all care of the ſhip and them-
ſelves, and fell to drinking. Our boat
had a piece out of her bottom near
two feet long, and we had no mate-
rials to mend her; however, neceſſity
being the mother of invention, I took
ſome pump leather and nailed it to
the broken part, and plaſtered it over
with tallow-greaſe. And, thus prepar-
ed, with the utmoſt anxiety of mind
we watched for day-light, and thought
every minute an hour till it º

At laſt it ſaluted our longing eyes,
and kind Providence accompanied its
approach with what was no ſmall
comfort to us; for the dreadful ſwells
began to ſubſide; and the next thing
that we diſcovered to raiſe our droop-
ing ſpirits, was a ſmall key or deſolate
iſland, about five or ſix miles off; but
a barrier ſoon preſented itſelf; forthere
was not water enough for our boat to
go over the reefs, and this threw us
again into a ſad conſternation; but there
was no alternative, we were therefore
obliged to put but few in the boat at
once; and, what was ſtill worſe, all of us
were frequently under the neceſſity of
getting out to drag and lift it over the
reefs. This coſt us much labour and
fatigue; and, what was yet more diſ-
treſſing, we could not avoid having
our legs cut and torn very much with
the rocks. There were only four peo-
ple
-

<page 365>

[ 48
ple that would work with me at the
oars; and they conſiſted of three black
men and a Dutch creole ſailor; and,
though we went with the boat five
times that day, we had no others to
aſſiſt us. But, had we not worked in
this manner, I really believe the peo-
ple could not have been ſaved; for not
one of the white men did any thing
to preſerve their lives; indeed they
ſoon got ſo drunk that they were not
able, but lay about the deck like ſwine,
ſo that we were at laſt obliged to lift
them into the boat and carry them on
ſhore by force. This want of aſſiſtance
made our labour intolerably ſevere;
inſomuch, that, by going on ſhore ſo
often that day, the ſkin was partly
ſtript off my hands. -
However, we continued all the day
to toil and ſtrain our exertions, till we
had brought all on board ſafe to the
2 - £hore;

<page 366>

[ 49 |
ſhore; ſo that out of thirty-two people
we loſt not one.
My dream now returned upon my
mind with all its force; it was ful-
filled in every part; for our danger
was the ſame I had dreamt of; and
I could not help looking on my—
ſelf as the principal inſtrument in ef-
ſecting our deliverance: for, owing to
fone of our people getting drunk, the
reſt of us were obliged to double our
exertions; and it was fortunate we
did, for in a very little time longer
the patch of leather on the boat would
have been worn out, and ſhe would
have been no longer fit for ſervice.
Situated as we were, who could think
that men ſhould be ſo careleſs of the
danger they were in? for, if the wind
had but raiſed the ſwell as it was when
the veſſel ſtruck, we muſt have bid a
final farewel to all hopes of deliver-
ance; and though, I warned the peo-

ple who were drinking, and entreated
them to embrace the moment of de-
liverance, nevertheleſs they perfiſhed,
as if not poſſeſſed of the leaſt ſpark
of reaſon. I could not help thinking,
that, if any of theſe people had been
loſt, God would charge me with their
lives, which, perhaps, was one cauſe
of my labouring ſo hard for their
preſervation, and indeed every one of
them afterwards ſeemed ſo ſenſible of
the ſervice I had rendered them, that
while we were on the key I was a kind
of chieftian amongſt them. I brought
ſome limes, oranges, and lemons a-
ihore; and, finding it to be a good
ſoil where we were, I planted ſeveral
of them as a token to any one that
might be caſt away hereafter. This
key, as we afterwards found, was one
of the Bahama iſlands, which conſiſt
of a cluſter of large iſlands, with
ſmaller

<page 368>

[ 51 )
ſmaller ones or keys, as they are called,
interſperſed among them. It was about
a mile in circumference, with a white
ſandy beach running in a regular order
along it. On that part of it where we
firſt attempted to land there ſtood.
ſome very large birds, called flamin-
goes: theſe, from the reflection of
the ſun, appeared to us at a little diſ-
tance as large as men; and, when they
walked backwards and forwards, we
could not conceive what they were:
our captain ſwore they were cannibals.
This created a great panic among us;
and we held a conſultation how to act.
The captain wanted to go to a key
that was within fight, but a great way
off; but I was againſt it, as in ſo
doing we ſhould not be able to ſave
all the people; “And therefore, ſaid I,
‘let us go on ſhore here, and perhaps
‘theſe cannibals may take to the water.”
D 2 Accordingly

<page 369>

[ 52 |
Accordingly we ſteered toward them;
and when we approached them, to our
very great joy and no leſs wonder, they
walked off one after the other very de-
liberately; and at laſt they took flight
and relieved us entirely from our fears.
About the key there were turtles and
ſeveral ſorts of fiſh in ſuch abundance
that we caught them without bait,
which was a great relief to us after the
ſalt proviſions on board. There was
alſo a large rock on the beach, about
ten feet high, which was in the form
of a punch-bowl at the top; this we
could not help thinking Providence
had ordained to ſupply us with rain-
water; and it was ſomething ſingular
that, if we did not take the water when
it rained, in ſome little time after it
would turn as ſalt as ſea-water.
Our firſt care, after refreſhment,
was to make ourſelvestents to lodge in,
which

<page 370>

[ 53
which we did as well as we could with
ſome ſails we had brought from the
ſhip. We then began to think how
we might get from this place, which
was quite uninhabited; and we deter-
mined to repair our boat, which was
very much ſhattered, and to put to ſea
in queſt of a ſhip or ſome inhabited
iſland. It took us up however cleven
days before we could get the boat
ready for ſea in the manner we wanted
it, with a ſail and other neceſſaries.
When we had got all things prepared,
the captain wanted me to ſtay on ſhore
while he went to ſea in queſt of a veſ-
fel to take all the people off the key;
but this I refuſed; and the captain and
myſelf, with five more, ſet off in the
boat towards New Providence. We
had no more than two muſket load of
gun-powder with us if anything ſhould
happen; and our ſtock of proviſions
D 3 conſiſted

<page 371>

[ 54 I
conſiſted of three gallons of rum, four
of water, ſome ſalt beef, ſome biſcuit;
and in this manner we proceeded
to ſea.
On the ſecond day of our voyage,
we came to an iſland called Abbico,
the largeſt of the Bahama iſlands. We
were much in want of water; for by
this time our water was expended,
and we were exceedingly fatigued in
ulling two days in the heat of the
fun; and it being late in the evening,
we hauled the boat aſhore to try for
water and remain during the night:
when we came aſhore we ſearched for.
water, but could find none. When
it was dark, we made a fire around us
for fear of the wild beaſts, as the place
was an entire thick wood, and we took
it by turns to watch. In this ſituation
we found very little reſt, and waited
with impatience for the morning. As
ſoon

<page 372>

[ 55

ſoon as the light appeared we ſet off
again with our boat, in hopes of find
ing aſſiſtance during the day. We
were now much dejected and weakened
by pulling the boat; for our ſail was of
no uſe, and we were almoſt ſamiſhed for
want of freſh water to drink. We had
nothing left to eat but ſalt beeſ, and
that we could not uſe without water.
In this ſituation we toiled all day in
fight of the iſland, which was very long;
in the evening, ſeeing no relief, we
made ſhore again, and faſtened our
boat. We then went to look for freſh
water, being quite ſaint for the want
of it; and we dug and ſearched about
for ſome all the remainder of the even-
ing, but could not find one drop, ſo
that our dejection at this period became
exceſſive, and our terror ſo great, that
we expected nothing but death to de-
liver us. We could not touch our
D 4 beef,



<page 373>

56
beef, which was ſalt as brine, with-
out freſh water; and we were in the
greateſt terror from the apprehenſion
of wild beaſts. When unwelcome
night came we acted as on the night
before; and the next morning we ſet
off again from the iſland in hopes of
ſeeing ſome veſſel. In this manner we
toiled as well as we were able till four
o'clock, during which we paſſed ſeve-
ral keys, but could not meet with a
ſhip; and, ſtill famiſhing with thirſt,
went aſhore on one of thoſe keys again
in hopes of finding ſome water. Here
we found ſome leaves with a few drops
of water in them, which we lapped
with much eagerneſs; we then dug in
ſeveral places, but without ſucceſs.
As we were digging holes in ſearch of
water there came forth ſome verythick
and black ſtuff; but none of us could
touch it, except the poor Dutch Cre-
ole,

<page 374>

[ 57 J
Creole, who drank above a quart of it
as eagerly as if had been wine. We
tried to catch fiſh, but could not; and
we now began to repine at our fate,
and abandonourſelvesto deſpair; when,
in the midſt of our murmuring, the
captain all at once cried out ‘A ſail!
“a ſail! a ſail! This gladdening
found was like a reprieve to a con-
vict, and we all inſtantly turned to
look at it; but in a little time ſome of
us began to be afraid it was not a ſail.
However, at a venture, we embarked
and ſteered after it; and, in half an
hour to our unſpeakablejoy, we plainly
ſaw that it was a veſſel. At this our
drooping ſpirits revived, and we made
towards her with all the ſpeed ima-
ginable. When we came near to her,
we found ſhe was a little ſloop, about
the ſize of a Graveſend hoy, and quite
full of people; a circumſtance which
D 5 We

<page 375>

[ 58
we could not make out the meaning
of Our captain, who was a Welch-
man, ſwore that they were pirates, and
would kill us. I ſaid, be that as it
might, we muſt board her if we were
to die by it; and, if they ſhould not
receive us kindly, we muſt oppoſe
them as well as we could; for there
was no alternative between their pe—
riſhing and ours. This counſel was
immediately taken; and I really be-
lieve that the captain, myſelf, and the
Dutchman, would then have faced
twenty men. We had two cutlaſſes
and a muſquet, that I brought in the
boat; and in this ſituation, we rowed
alongſide, and immediately boarded
her. I believe there were about forty
hands on board; but how great was
our ſurpriſe, as ſoon as we got on

board, to find that the major part of
them


<page 376>

59 |
them were in the ſame predicament
as ourſelves.
They belonged to a whaling ſchoo-
ner that was wrecked two days before
us about nine miles to the north of
our veſſel. When ſhe was wrecked
ſome of them had taken to their boats
and had left ſome of their people and
property on a key, in the ſame manner
as we had done; and were going, like
us, to New Providence in queſt of a
ſhip, when they met with this little
ſloop, called a wrecker; their employ–
ment in thoſe ſeas being to look after
wrecks. They were then going to
take the remainder of the people be-
longing to the ſchooner; for which
the wrecker was to have all things be-
longing to the veſſel, and likewiſe their
people's help to get what they could
out of her, and were then to carry
the crew to New Providence.
-
D 6 We

<page 377>

I to
We told the people of the wrecker
the condition of our veſſel, and we
made the ſame agreement with them
as the ſchooner's people; and, on their
complying, we begged of them to go
to our key directly, becauſe our people
were in want of water. They agreed,
therefore, to go along with us firſt; and
in two days we arrived at the key, to
the inexpreſſible joy of the people that
we had left behind, as they had been
reduced to great extremities for want
of water in our abſence. Luckily for
us, the wrecker had now more people
on board than ſhe could carry or vic-
tual for any moderate length of time;
they therefore hired the ſchooner's
people to work on the wreck, and
we left them our boat, and embarked
for New Providence.
Nothing could have been more for-
tunate than our meeting with this
WrcCK-

<page 378>

f 61 |
wrecker, for New Providence was at
ſuch a diſtance that we never could
have reached it in our boat. The
iſland of Abbico was much longer
than we expected; and it was not till
after ſailing for three or four days that
we got ſafe to the farther end of it,
towards New Providence. When we
arrived there we watered, and got a
good many lobſters and other ſhell-
fiſh; which proved a great relief to us,
as our proviſions and water were almoſt
exhauſted. We then proceeded on our
voyage; but the day after we left the
Iſland, late in the evening, and whilſt
we were yet amongſt the Bahama
keys, we were overtaken by a vio-
lent gale of wind, ſo that we were
obliged to cut away the maſt. The
veſſel was very near foundering;
for ſhe parted from her anchors,
and ſtruck ſeveral times on the
ſhoals,


<page 379>

[ 62 j
ſhoals. Here we expected every mi-
nute that ſhe would have gone to
pieces, and each moment to be our
laſt; ſo much ſo, that my old captain
and ſickly uſeleſs mate, and ſeveral
others, fainted; and death ſtared us in
the face on every ſide. All the ſwearers
on board now began to call on the
God of Heaven to aſſiſt them: and,
ſure enough, beyond our compre-
henſion he did aſſiſt us, and in a mira–
culous manner delivered us! In the
very height of our extremity the wind
lulled for a few minutes; and, although
the ſwell was high beyond expreſſion,
two men, who were expert ſwimmers,
attempted to go to the buoy of the an-
chor, which we ſtill ſaw on the water,
at ſome diſtance, in a little punt that
belonged to the wrecker, which was
not large enough to carry more than
two. Shefilledataifferent times in their

CIl-

[ 63 |
endeavours to get into her alongſide of
our veſſel; and they ſaw nothing but
death before them, as well as we, but
they ſaid they might as well die that
way as any other. A coil of very ſmall
rope, with a little buoy, was put in
along with them; and, at laſt, with
great hazard, they got the punt clear
from the veſſel; and theſe two intrepid
water heroes paddled away for life to-
wards the buoy of the anchor. Our
eyes were fixed on them all the
time, expecting every minute to be
their laſt; and the prayers of all thoſe
that remained in their ſenſes were of
fered up to God, on their behalf, for a
ſpeedy deliverance, and for our own,
which depended on them; and he heard
and anſwered us! Theſe two men at
laſt reached the buoy; and, having
faſtened the punt to it, they tied one
end of their rope to the ſmall buoy
that

<page 381>

ſ 64 )
that they had in the punt, and ſentic
adrift towards the veſſel. We onboard
obſerving this threw out boat-hooks
and leads faſtened to lines, in order to
catch the buoy: at laſt we caught it,
and faſtened a hawſer to the end of the
ſmall rope; we then gave them a ſign
to pull, and they pulled the hawſer to
them, and faſtenedit to the buoy: which
being done we hauled for our lives;
and, through the mercy of God, we got
again from the ſhoals into deep water,
and the punt got ſafe to the veſſel.
It is impoſſible for any to conceive our
heart-feltjoy at this ſecond deliverance
from ruin, but thoſe who have ſuffered
the ſame hardſhips. Thoſe whoſe
ſtrength and ſenſes were gone, came to
themſelves, and were now as elated as
they were before depreſſed. Two days
after this the wind ceaſed, and the
water became ſmooth. The punt

then went on ſhore, and we cut down
ſome trees; and having found our maſt
and mended it we brought it on board,
and fixed it up. As ſoon as we had
done this we got up the anchor, and
away we went once more for New
Providence, which in three days more
we reached ſafe, after having been
above three weeks in a ſituation in
which we did not expect to eſcape
with life. The inhabitants here were
very kind to us; and, when they learned
our ſituation, ſhewed us a great deal of
hoſpitality and friendſhip. Soon after
this every one of my old fellow-ſuſ.
ferers that were free parted from us,
and ſhaped their courſe where their
inclination led them. One merchant,
who had a large ſloop, ſeeing our con-
dition, and knowing we wanted to go
to Georgia, told four of us that his
veſſel was going there; and, if we
would

<page 383>

| 66 J
would work on board and load her, he
would give us our paſſage free. As
we could not get any wages whatever,
and found it very hard to get of the
place, we were obliged to conſent to
his propoſal; and we went on board
and helped to load the ſloop, though
we had only our victuals allowed us.
When ſhe was entirely loaded, he told
us ſhe was going to Jamaica firſt,
where we muſt go if we went in her.
This, however, I refuſed; but my
fellow-ſufferers not having any mo-
ney to help themſelves with, neceſſity
obliged them to accept of the offer, and
to ſteer that courſe, though they did
not like it.
We ſtayed in New Providence about
ſeventeen or eighteen days; during
which time I met with many friends,
who gave me encouragement to ſtay
there with them, but I declined it;
though,

<page 384>

| 67
though, had not my heart been fixed
on England, I ſhould have ſtayed, as I
liked the place extremely, and there
were ſome free black people here who
were very happy, and we paſſed our
time pleaſantly together, with the me-
lodious found of the catguts, under
the lime and lemon trees. At length
Captain Phillips hired a ſloop to carry
him and ſome of the ſlaves that he
could not ſell to Georgia; and I agreed
to go with him in this veſſel, meaning
now to take my farewel of that place.
When the veſſel was ready we allem-
barked; and I took my leave of New
Providence, not without regret. We
failed about four o'clock the morn-
ing with a fair wind, for Georgia; and
about eleven o’clock the ſame morn-
ing, a ſudden and ſhort gale ſprung up
and blew away moſt of our ſails; and,
as we were ſtill among the keys, in
a very

againſt the rocks. Luckily for us the
water was deep; and the ſea was not
ſo angry, but that, after having for
ſome time laboured hard, and being
many in number, we were ſaved,
through God's mercy; and, by uſing
our greateſt exertions, we got the veſ.
ſel off. The next day we returned to
Providence, where we ſoon got her
again refitted. Some of the people
ſwore that we had ſpells ſet upon us by
ſomebody in Montſerrat; and others.
that we had witches and wizzards
amongſt the poor helpleſs ſlaves; and
that we never ſhould arrive ſafe at
Georgia. But theſe things did not de-
ter me; I ſaid, ‘Let us again face the
“winds and ſeas, and ſwear not, but
“truſt to God, and he will deliver us.”
Wetherefore once more ſet ſail; and,
with

<page 386>

| 69 |
with hard labour in ſeven days time
arrived ſafe at Georgia.
After our arrival we went up to the
town of Savannah; and the ſame even-
ing I went to a friend's houſe to lodge,
whoſe name was Moſa, a black man.
We were very happy at meeting each
other; and after ſupper we had a light
till it was between nine and ten o’clock
at night. About that time the watch
or patrol came by; and, diſcerning a
light in the houſe, they knocked at the
door: we opened it; and they came in
and ſat down and drank ſome punch
with us: they alſo begged ſome limes
of me, as they underſtood I had ſome,
which I readily gave them. A little
after this they told me I muſt go to the
watch-houſe with them: this ſurpriſed
me a good deal, after our kindneſs
to them; and I aſked them, Why ſo :
They ſaid that all negroes who had a


light

<page 387>

E 7o
light in their houſes after nine o'clock
were to be taken into cuſtody, and
either pay ſome dollars or be flogged.
Some of thoſe people knew that I was
a free man; but, as the man of the
houſe was not free, and had his maſter
to protect him, they did not take the
ſame liberty with him they did with
me. I told them that I was a free
man, and juſt arrived from Providence;
that we were not making any noiſe,
and that I was not a ſtranger in that
place, but was very well known there :
* Beſides, ſaid I, ‘what will you do
with me?— That you ſhall ſee,' re-
plied they, but you muſt go to the
* watch-houſe with us.” Now whether
they meant to get money from me or
not I was at a loſs to know; but I
thought immediately of the oranges
and limes at Santa Cruz; and ſeeing
that nothing would pacify them I went
with

<page 388>

[ 71 ||
with them to the wach-houſe, where I
remained during the night. Early the
next morning theſe impoſing ruſians
flogged a negro-man and woman that
they had in the watch-houſe, and then
they told me that I muſt be flogged
too. I aſked why? and if there was
no law for free men? and told them
if there was I would have it put in
force againſt them. But this only
exaſperated them the more, and in-
ſtantly ſwore they would ſerve me as
Doctor Perkins had done; and were
going to lay violent hands on me;
when one of them, more humane than
the reſt, ſaid that as I was a free man
they could not juſtify ſtripping me by
law. I then immediately ſent for
Doctor Brady, who was known to be
an honeſt and worthy man; and on his
coming tomy aſſiſtance they let mego.

This was not the only diſagreeable
incident I met with while I was in this
place; for, one day, while I was a little
way out of the town of Savannah, I
was beſet by two white men, who meant
to play their uſual tricks with me in
the way of kidnapping. As ſoon as
theſe men accoſted me, one of them
ſaid to the other, “This is the very fel-
“low we are looking for, that you loſt:
and the other ſwore immediately that
I was the identical perſon. On this
they made up to me, and were about
to handle me; but I told them to be
ſtill and keep off; for I had ſeen thoſe
kind of tricks played upon other free
blacks, and they muſt not think to ſerve
me ſo. At this they pauſed a little, and
one ſaid to the other—it will not do;
and the other anſwered that I talked
two good Engliſh. I replied, I be-
lieved I did; and I had alſo with mea
revenge-

<page 390>

| 73

revengeful ſtick equal to the occaſion;
and my mind was likewiſe good. Hap-
pily however it was not uſed; and,
after we had talked together a little in
this manner, the rogues left me.
I ſtayed in Savannah ſometime, anxi-
ouſly trying to get to Montſerrat once
more to ſee Mr. King, my old maſter,
and then to take a final farewel of the
American quarter of the globe. At laſt
I met with a ſloop called the Speed-
well, Captain John Bunton, which be-
longed to Grenada, and was bound to
Martinico, a French iſland, with a
cargo of rice, and I ſhipped myſelf on
board of her.
Before I left Georgia, a blackwoman
who had a child lying dead, being very
tenacious of the church burial ſervice,
and not able to get any white perſon
to perform it, applied to me for that
purpoſe. I told her I was no parſon;

Vol. II. E and

74 |
and beſides, that the ſervice over the
dead did not affect the ſoul. This
however did not ſatisfy her; ſhe ſtill
urged me very hard: I therefore com-
plied with her earneſt entreaties, and
at laſt conſented to act the parſon for
the firſt time in my life. As ſhe was
much reſpected, there was a great com-
pany both of white and black people
at the grave. I then accordingly aſ-
ſumed my new vocation, and perform-
ed the funeral ceremony to the ſatis-
faction of all preſent; after which I
bade adieu to Georgia, and failed for
Martinico.

diſguſted me very much againſt the
place; and when I left it and ſailed for
Martinico I determined never more to
reviſit it. My new captain conducted
his veſſel ſafer than my former one;
and, after an agreeable voyage, we got
ſafe to our intended port. While I was
on this iſland I went about a good deal,
and found it very pleaſant: in parti-
cular I admired the town of St. Pierre,
which is the principal one in the
iſland, and builtmore like an European
town than any I had ſeen in the Weſt
Indies. In general alſo, ſlaves were
better treated, had more holidays, and
looked better than thoſe in the Engliſh
iſlands. After we had done our bu-
fineſs here, I wanted my diſcharge,
which was neceſſary; for it was then
the month of May, and I wiſhed
much to be at Montſerral to bid
farewel to Mr. King, and all my

other friends there, in time to ſail for
Old England in the July fleet. But,
alas! I had put a great ſtumblingblock
in my own way, by which I was near
loſing my paſſage that ſeaſon to Eng-
land. I had lent my captain ſome
money, which I now wanted to enable
me to proſecute my intentions. This
I told him; but when I applied for it,
though I urged the neceſſity of my
occaſion, I met with ſo much ſhuffling
from him, that I began at laſt to be
afraid of loſing my money, as I could
not recover it by law; for I have
already mentioned, that throughout the
Weſt Indies no black man’s teſtimony
is admitted, on any occaſion, againſt
any white perſon whatever, and there-
fore my own oath would have been of
no uſe. I was obliged, therefore, to
remain with him till he might be diſ-
poſed to return it to me. Thus we

failed from Martinico for the Grenades.
I frequently preſſing the captain for my
money to no purpoſe; and, to render
my condition worſe, when we got
there, the captain and his owners quar-
relied; ſo that my ſituation became
daily more irkſome : for beſides that
we on board had little or no vićtuals.
allowed us, and I could not get my
money nor wages, as I could then have
gotten my paſſage frce to Montſerrat
had I been able to accept it. The
worſt of all was, that it was growing
late in July, and the ſhips in the iſlands
muſt ſail by the 26th of that month. At
laſt, however, with a great many en-
treaties, I got my money from the
captain, and took the firſt veſſel I could
meet with for St Euſtatia. From thence
I went in another to Baſſeterre in St.
Kitts, where I arrived on the 19th of
July. On the 22d, having met with a
veſſel

<page 396>

[ 79 |
veſſel bound to Montſerrat, I wanted to
go in her; but the captain and others
would not take me on board until I
ſhould advertiſemyſelf, and give notice
of my going off theiſland. I told them
of my haſte to be in Montſerrat, and
that the time then would not admit of
advertiſing, it being late in the even-
ing, and the veſſel about to ſail; but
he infifted it was neceſſary, and other-
wiſe he ſaid he would not take me.
This reduced me to great perplexity;
for if I ſhould be compelled to ſubmit
to this degrading neceſſity, which every
black freeman is under, of advertiſing
himſelf like a ſlave, when he leaves an
iſland, and which I thought a groſs im-
poſition upon any freeman, I feared I
ſhould miſs that opportunity of going
to Montſerrat, and then I could not get
to England that year. The veſſel was
juſt going off, and notime could be loſt;
E 4 I im–


<page 397>

I immediately therefore ſet about, with
a heavy heart, to try who I could get to
befriend me in complying with the de-
mands of the captain. Luckily I found,
in a few minutes, ſome gentlemen of
Montſerrat whom I knew, and, have
ing told them my ſituation, I requeſted
their friendly aſſiſtance in helping me
off the iſland. Some of them, on this,
went with me to the captain, and ſatis-
fied him of my freedom; and, to my
very great joy, he deſired me to go on
board. We then ſet ſail, and the next
day, 23d, I arrived at the wiſhed—for
place, after an abſence of ſix months,
in which I had more than once experi-
enced the delivering hand of Provi-
dence, when all human means of eſcap-
ing deſtruction ſeemed hopeleſs. 1 ſaw
my friends with a gladneſs of heart
which was increaſed by my abſence
and the dangers I had eſcaped, and I
was received with great friendſhip by
them

<page 398>

I 81 J
them all, but particularly by Mr. King,
to whom Irelated the fate of his ſloop,
the Nancy, and the cauſes of her being
wrecked. I now learned with extreme
ſorrow, that his houſe was waſhed away
during my abſence, by the burſting of
a pond at the top of a mountain that
was oppoſite the town of Plymouth. It
ſwept great part of the town away, and
Mr. King loſt a great deal of property
from the inundation, and nearly his life.
When I told him I intended to go to
London that ſeaſon, and that I had
come to viſit him before my departure,
the good man expreſſed a great deal of
affection for me, and ſorrow that I
ſhould leave him, and warmly adviſed
me to ſtay there; inſiſting, as I was
much reſpected by all the gentlemen in
the place, that I might do very well,
and in a ſhort time have land and ſlaves
of my own. I thanked him for this

<page 399>

I 82 )
inſtance of his friendſhip; but, as I
wiſhed very much to be in London, I
declined remaining any longer there,
and begged he would excuſe me. I
then requeſted he would be kindenough
to give me a certificate of my behavi-
our while in his ſervice, which he very
readily complied with, and gave me the
following:
Montſerrat, january 26, 1767.
* The bearer hereof, Guſtavus Vaſa,
“was my ſlave for upwards of three
• years, during which he has always
‘behaved himſelf well, and diſcharged
‘ his duty with honeſty and aſſiduity.

“To all to whom this may concern.”
Having obtained this, I parted from
my kind maſter, after many ſincere
profeſſions of gratitude and regard,
and

and prepared for my departureſor Lon-
don. I immediately agreed to go with
one Capt. John Hamer, for ſeven gui-
neas (the paſſage to London) on board
a ſhip called, the Andromache; and on
the 24th and 25th, I had free dances,
as they are called, with ſome of my
countrymen, previous to my feeting
off; after which I took leave of all my
friends, and on the 26th I embarked for
London, exceedingly glad to ſee myſelf
once more on board of a ſhip; and ſtill
more ſo, in ſteering the courſe I had
long wiſhed for. With a light heart I
bade Montſerrat farewell, and never
had my feet on it ſince, and with it
bade adieu to the ſound of the cruel
whip, and all other dreadful inſtruments
of torture; adieu to the offenſive fight
of the violated chaſtity of the ſable
females, which has too often accoſted
my eyes; adieuto oppreſſions (although
to


<page 401>

84
to me leſs ſevere than moſt of my
countrymen); and adieu to the angry
howling, daſhing ſurfs. I wiſhed for a
grateful and thankful heart to praiſe the
Lord God on high for all his mercies!
in this extaſy Iſteered the ſhip all night.
We had a moſt proſperous voyage,
and, at the end of ſeven weeks, arrived
at Cherry-Garden ſtairs. Thus were
my longing eyes once more gratified
with a fight of London, after having
been abſent from it above four years.
I immediately received my wages, and
I never had earned ſeven guineas ſo
quick in my life before; I had thirty-
ſeven guineas in all, when I got cleared
of the ſhip. I now entered upon a
ſcene quite new to me, but full of
hope. In this ſituation my firſt thoughts
were to look out for ſome of my former
friends, and amongſt the firſt of thoſe
were the Miſs Guerins. Asſoon, there-
fore, as I had regaled myſelf I went in
queſt

<page 402>

85 I
queſt of thoſe kind ladies, whom 1 was
very impatient to ſee; and with ſome
difficulty and perſeverance, I found
them at May's—hill, Greenwich. They
were moſt agreeably ſurpriſed to ſee
me, and I quite overjoyed at meeting
with them. Itold them my hiſtory, at
which they expreſſed great wonder, and
freely acknowledged it did their couſin,
Capt. Paſcal, no honour. He then
viſited there frequently; and I met him
four or five days after in Greenwich
park. When he ſaw me he appeared
a good deal ſurpriſed, and aſked me
how I came back? I anſwered, In a
‘ſhip. To which he replied dryly,
* I ſuppoſe you did not walk back to
* London on the water. As I ſaw, by
his manner, that he did not ſeem to be
ſorry for his behaviour to me, and that I
had not much reaſon to expect any
favour from him, I told him that he
- had


<page 403>

[ 86
had uſed me very ill, after I had been
fuch a faithful ſervant to him for ſo
many years; on which, without ſaying
any more, he turned about and went
away. A few days after this I met
Capt. Paſcal at Miſs Guérin's houſe,
and aſked him for my prize-money.
He ſaid there was none due to me; for,
if my prize-money had been ſo,Cool.
he had a right to it all. I told him I
was informed otherwiſe: on which he
bade me defiance; and in a bantering
tone, deſired me to commence a law-
ſuit againſt him for it: ‘There are law-
• yers enough, ſaid he, “that will take
the cauſe in hand, and you had better
try it.’ I told him then that I would
try it, which enraged him very much;
however, out of regard to the ladies, I
remained ſtill, and never made any far-
ther demand of my right. Some time
afterwards theſe friendly ladies aſked
me

<page 404>

[ 87 |
mewhat I meant to do with myſelf,
and how they could aſſiſt me. I thanked
them, and ſaid, if they pleaſed, I would
be their ſervant; but if not, I had
thirty-ſeven gnineas, which would ſup-
port me for ſome time, I would be
much obliged to them to recommend
me to ſome perſon who would teach me
a buſineſs whereby I might earn my
living. They anſwered me very po-
litely, that they were ſorry it did not
ſuit them to take me as their ſervant,
and aſked me what buſineſs I ſhould
like to learn? I ſaid, hair-dreſſing.
They then promiſed to aſſiſt me in
this; and ſoon after they recommended
me to a gentleman whom I had known
before, one Capt. O'Hara, who treated
me with much kindneſs, and procured
mea maſter, a hair-dreſſer, in Coventry-
court, Haymarket, with whom heplaced
me. I was with thisman from Septem-
ber


<page 405>

[ 88
bertill the February following. In that
time we had a neighbour in the ſame
court who taughtthe French-horn. He
uſed to blow it ſo well that I was
charmed with it, and agreed with him
to teach me to blow it. Accordingly
he took me in hand, and began to in-
ſtruct me, and I ſoon learned all the
three parts. I took great delight in
blowing on this inſtrument, the evenings
being long; and beſides that I was fond
of it, I did not like to be idle, and it
filled up my vacant hours innocently.
At this time alſo I agreed with the
Rev. Mr. Gregory, who lived in the
ſame court, where he kept an academy
and an evening-ſchool, to improve me
in arithmetic. This he did as far as
barter and alligation; ſo that all the
time I was there I was entirely em-
ployed. In February 1768, I hired
myſelf to Dr. Charles Irving, in Pall-
mall,

<page 406>

I 89 |
mall, ſo celebrated for his ſucceſsful
experiments in making ſeawater freſh;
and here I had plenty of hair dreſſing
to improvemy hand. This gentleman
was an excellent maſter; he was exceed-
ingly kind and good tempered; and
allowed me in the evenings to attend
my ſchools, which I eſteemed a great
bleſſing; therefore I thanked God and
him for it, and uſed all my diligence
to improve the opportunity. This dili-
gence and attention recommended me
to the notice and care of my three pre-
ceptors, who on their parts beſtowed a
great deal of pains in my inſtruction,
and beſides were all very kind to me.
My wages, however, which were by
two thirds leſs than ever I had in my
life (for I had only 121 per annum) I
ſoon found would not be ſufficient to
defray this extraordinary expence of
maſters, and my own neceſſary ex-
pences;


<page 407>

I go
pences; my old thirty-ſeven guineas
had by this time worn all away to one.
I thought it beſt, therefore, to try the
ſea again in queſt of more money, as I
had been bred to it, and had hitherto
found the profeſſion of it ſucceſsful. I
had alſo a very great deſire to ſee
Turkey, and I now determined to gra-
tify it. Accordingly, in the month of
May, 1768, I told the doctor my wiſh
to go to ſea again, to which he made
Hooppoſition; and weparted on friendly
terms. The ſame day I went into the
eity in queſt of a maſter. I was ex-
tremely fortunatein my inquiry; for I
ſoon heard of a gentleman who had a
ſhip going to Italy and Turkey, and he
wantedaman who could dreſs hairwell.
I was overjoyed at this, and wentimme-
diately on board of his ſhip, as I had
been directed, which I found to be
fitted up with greattaſte, and I already
foreboded

<page 408>

| 9 |
foreboded no ſmall pleaſure in ſailing
in her. Not finding the gentleman on
board, I was directed to his lodgings,
where I met with him the next day,
and gave him a ſpecimen of my dreſſing.
He liked it ſo well that he hired me
immediately, ſo that I was perfectly
happy; for the ſhip, maſter, and
voyage, were intirely to my mind.
The ſhip was called the Delawar, and
my maſter's name was John Jolly, a
meat ſmart good humoured man, juſt
ſuch an one as I wiſhed to ſerve. We
failed from England in July following,
and our voyage was extremely pleaſant.
We went to Villa Franca, Nice, and
Leghorn; and in all theſe places I was
charmed with the richneſs and beauty
of the countries, and ſtruck with the
elegant buildings with which they
abound. We had always in them
plenty of extraordinary good wines and

rich

<page 409>

[ 92 j
rich fruits, which I was very fond of:
and I had frequent occaſions of gratify-
ing both my taſte and curioſity; for
my captain always lodged on ſhore in
thoſe places, which afforded me oppor-
tunities to ſee the country around. I
alſo learned navigation of the mate,
which I was very fond of When we
left Italy we had delightful ſailing
among the Archipelago iſlands, and
from thence to Smyrna in Turkey.
This is a very ancient city; the houſes
are built of ſtone, and moſt of them
have graves adjoining to them; ſo that
they ſometimes preſent the appearence
of church-yards. Proviſions are very
plentiful in this city, and good wine
leſs than a penny a pint. The grapes,
pomegranates, and many other fruits,
were alſo the richeſt and largeſt I ever
taſted. The natives are well looking


and ſtrong made, and treated me al-
ways

<page 410>

[ 93 )
ways with great civility. In general
I believe they are fond of black peo-
ple; and ſeveral of them gave me
preſſing invitations to ſtay amongſt
them, although they keep the franks, or
Chriſtians, ſeparate, and do not ſuffer
them to dwell immediately amongſt
them. I was aſtoniſhed in not ſeeing
women in any of their ſhops, and very
rarely any in the ſtreets; and when-
ever I did they were covered with a
veil from head to foot, ſo that I could
not ſee their faces, except when any of
them out of curioſity uncovered them
to look at me, which they ſometimes
did. I was ſurpriſed to ſee how the
Greeks are, in ſome meaſure, kept un-
der by the Turks, as the negroes are
in the Weſt Indies by the white people.
The leſs refined Greeks, as I have al-
ready hinted, dance here in the ſame
manner as we do in our nation.

[ 94
On the whole, during our ſtay here,
which was about five months, I liked
the place and the Turks extremely well.
I could not help obſerving one very re-
markable circumſtance there: the tails
of the ſheep are flat, and ſo very large,
that I have known the tail even of a
lamb to weigh from eleven to thirteen
pounds. The fat of them is very white
and rich, and is excellent in puddings,
for which it is much uſed. Our ſhip
being at length richly loaded with filk,
and otherarticles, we ſailed for ºngland.
In May 1769, ſoon after our return
from Turkey, our ſhip made a delight-
ful voyage to Oporto in Portugal,
where we arrived at the time of the
carnival. On our arrival, there were
ſent on board of us thirty-ſix articles to
obſerve with very heavy penalties if we
ſhould break any of them; and none of
us even dared to go on board any other

veſſel or on ſhore, till the Inquiſition
had ſent on board and ſearched for
every thing illegal, eſpecially bibles.
Such as were produced, and certain
other things were ſent on ſhore till the
ſhips were going away; and any per-
ſon in whoſe cuſtody a bible was found
concealed, was to be impriſoned and
flogged, and ſent into ſlavery for ten
years. I ſaw here many very magnifi-
cent fights, particularly the garden of
Eden, where many of the clergy and
laity went in proceſſion in their ſeveral
orders with the hoſt, and ſung Te De-
um. I had a great curioſity to go into
ſome of their churches, but could not
gain admittance without uſing the ne–
ceſſary ſprinkling of holy water at my
entrance. From curioſity, and a wiſh
to be holy, I therefore complied with
this ceremony, but its virtues were loſt
upon me, for I found myſelf nothing
the



<page 413>
[ 96 J
the better for it. This place abounds
with plenty of all kinds of proviſions.
The town is well built and pretty, and
commands a fine proſpect. Our ſhip
having taken in a load of wine, and
other commodities, we ſailed for Lon-
don, and arrived in July following.
Our next voyage was to the Mediter-
ranean. The ſhip was again got ready,
and we ſailed in September for Genoa.
This is one of the fineſt cities I ever
ſaw; ſome of the edifices were of beau-
tiful marble, and made a moſt noble ap-
pearance; and many had very curious
fountains before them. The churches
were rich and magnificent, and curi-
ouſly adorned both in the inſide and
out. But all this grandeur was in my
eyes diſgraced by the galley ſlaves,
whoſe condition both there and in other
parts of Italy is truly piteous and wretch-
ed. After we had ſtayed there ſome
weeks,

weeks, during which we bought many
different things we wanted, and got
them very cheap, we ſailed to Naples,
a charming city, and remarkably clean.
The bay is the moſt beautiful I ever
faw; the moles for ſhipping are excel-
lent. I thought it extraordinary to ſee
grand operas acted here on Sunday
nights, and even attended by their ma-
jeſties. I too, like theſe great ones,
went to thoſe ſights, and vainly ſerve
ed God in the day while I thus ſerved
mammon elfectually at night. While
we remained here, there happened an
eruption of mount Veſuvius, of which
I had a perfect view. It was extreme-
ly awful; and we were ſo near that the
aſhes from it uſed to be thick on our
deck. After we had tranſacted our
buſineſs at Naples, we ſailed with a
fair wind once more for Smyrna, where
we arrived in December. A feraſkier

or officer, took a liking to me here,
and wanted me to ſtay, and offered me
two wives; however I refuſed the temp-
tation, thinking one was as much as
ſome could manage, and more than
others would venture on. The mer-
chants here travel in caravans or large
companies. I have ſeen many cara-
vans from India, with ſome hundreds
of camels, laden with different goods.
The people of theſe caravans are quite
brown. Among other articles, they
brought with them a great quantity of
locuſts, which are a kind of pulſe, ſweet
and pleaſant to the palate, and in ſhape
reſembling French beans, but longer.
Each kind of goods is ſold in a ſtreet
by itſelf, and I always found the Turks
very honeſt in their dealings. They
let no Chriſtians into their moſques or
churches, for which I was very ſorry;
as I was always fond of going to ſee
- the

<page 416>

[ 99 |
the different modes of worſhip of the
people wherever I went. The plague
broke out while we were in Smyrna,
and we ſtopped taking goods into the
{hip till it was over. She was then
richly laden, and we ſailed in about
March 1770, for England. One day
in our paſſage we met with an accident
which was near burning the ſhip. A
black cook, in melting ſome fat, over-
ſet the pan into the fire under the deck,
which immediately began to blaze, and
the flame went up very high under
the foretop. With the fright, the poor
cook became almoſt white, and altoge-
ther ſpeechleſs. Happily however wo
got the fire out without doing much
miſchief. After various delays in this
paſſage, which was tedious, we arrived
in Standgate creek in July; and, at the
latter end of the year, ſome new event
F 2 occurred,

<page 417>

I too

occurred, ſo that my noble captain,
the ſhip, and I all ſeparated.
In April 1771, Iſhipped myſelf as a
ſteward with Capt. Wm. Robertſon of
the ſhip Grenada Planter, once more to
try my fortune in the Weſt Indies; and
we ſailed from London for Madeira,
Barbadoes, and the Grenades. When
we were at this laſt place, having ſome
goods to ſell, I met once more with my
former kind of Weſt India cuſtomers.
A white man, an iſlander, bought
ſome goods of me to the amount of
ſome pounds, and made me many fair
promiſes as uſual, but without any in-
tention of paying me. He had like-
wife bought goods from ſome more of
our people, whom he intended to ſerve
in the ſame manner; but he ſtill amuſ-
edus with promiſes. However, when
our ſhip was loaded, and near failing,
this honeſt buyer diſcovered no inten-
tion

<page 418>

I to
tion or ſign of paying for anything he
had bought of us; but on the contrary,
when I aſked him for my money he
threatened me and another black man
he had bought goods of, ſo that we
found we were like to get more blows
than payment. On this we went to
complain to one Mr. M'Intoſh, a juſ-
tice of the peace; we told his worſhip
of the man's villainous tricks, and beg-
ged that he would be kind enough to
ſee us redreſſed: but being negroes,
although free, we could not get any
remedy; and our ſhip being then juſt
upon the point of ſailing, we knew
not how to help ourſelves, though we
thought it hard to loſe our property in
this manner. Luckily for us however,
this man was alſo indebted to three
white ſailors, who could not get a far-
thing from him; they therefore readily
joined us, and we all went together in
F3 ſearch

<page 419>

[ roº J
ſearch of him. When we ſound where
he was, I took him out of a houſe
and threatened him with vengeance;
on which, finding he was likely to be
handled roughly, the rogue offered
each of us ſome ſmall allowance, but
nothing near our demands. This
exaſperated us much more; and ſome
were for cutting his ears off; but he
begged hard for mercy, which was at
laſt granted him, after we had entirely
ſtripped him. We then let him go, for
which he thanked us, glad to get of
ſo eaſily, and ran into the buſhes, after
having wiſhed usa good voyage. We
then repaired on board, and ſhortly
after ſet ſail for England. I cannot
help remarking here a very narrow
eſcape we had from being blown up,
owing to a piece of negligence of mine.
Juſt as our ſhip was under ſail, I went
down under the cabin to do ſome buſi-
neſs,

<page 420>

[ rog J
neſs, and had a lighted candle in my
hand, which, in my hurry, without
thinking, I held in a barrel of gun-
powder. It remained in the powder
until it was near catching fire, when
fortunately I obſerved it and ſnatched
it out in time, and providentially no
harm happened; but I was ſo over-
come with terror that I immediately
fainted at this deliverance.
In twenty-eight days time we arriv-
cd in England, and I got clear of this
ſhip. But, being ſtill of a roving diſ-
poſition, and deſirous of ſeeing as many
different parts of the world as I could,
I ſhipped myſelf ſoon after, in the ſame
year, as ſteward on board of a fine large
ſhip, called the Jamaica, Captain David
Watt, and we ſailed from England in
December 1771, for Nevis and Jamaica.
I found Jamaica to be a very fine large
iſland, well peopled, and the moſt con-
F 4 ſiderable


<page 421>

| roº J
fiderable of the Weſt India iſlands.
There was a vaſt number of negroes
here, whom I found as uſual exceed-
ingly impoſed upon by the white peo-
ple, and the ſlaves puniſhed as in the
other iſlands. There are negroes whoſe
buſineſs it is to flog ſlaves; they go
about to different people for employ–
ment, and the uſual pay is from one to
four bits. I ſaw many cruel puniſh-
ments inflićted on the ſlaves in the
ſhort time I ſtayed here. In particular
I was preſent when a poor fellow was
tied up and kepthanging by the wriſts
at ſome diſtance from the ground, and
then ſome half hundred weights were
fixed to his ancies, in which poſture he
was flogged moſt unmercifully. There
were alſo, as I heard, two different maſ-
ters noted for cruelty on the iſland,
who had ſtaked up two negroes naked,
and in two hours the verminftung them
to.

<page 422>

to death. I heard a gentleman, I well
knew, tell my captain that he paſſed ſen-
tence on a negro man to be burnt alive
for attempting to poiſon an overſeer.
I paſs over numerous other inſtances,
in order to relieve the reader by a
milder ſcene of roguery. Before I had
been long on the iſland, one Mr. Smith
at Port Morant, bought goods of me to
the amount of twenty-five pounds ſter-
ling; but when I demanded payment
from him, he was going each time to
beat me, and threatened that he would
put me in goal. One time he would
ſay I was going to ſet his houſe on
fire; at another, he would ſwear I was
going to run away with his ſlaves. I
was aſtoniſhed at this uſage from a per-
fon who was in the ſituation of agen-
tleman, but I had no alternative; and
was therefore obliged to ſubmit. When
I came to Kingſton, I was ſurpriſed to
F 5 ſee

<page 423>

[ ſoč
ſee the number of Africans who were
aſſembled together on Sundays; parti-
cularly at a large commodious place,
called Spring Path. Here each differ-
ent nation of Africa meet and dance
after the manner of their own country.
They ſtill retain moſt of their native
cuſtoms: they bury their dead, and
put vićtuals, pipes and tobacco, and
other things, in the grave with the
corps, in the ſame manner as in Africa.
Our ſhip having got her loading we
ſailed for London, where we arrived
in the Auguſt following. On my re-
turn to London, I waited on my old
and good maſter, Dr. Irving, who
made me an offer of his ſervice again.
Being now tired of the ſea Igladly ac-
cepted it. I was very happy in living
with this gentleman once more; dur-
ing which time we were daily employ-
ed in reducing old Neptune's domi-

nions by purifying the briny element
and making it freſh. Thus I went on
till May 1773, when I was rouſed by
the ſound of fame, to ſeek new adven-
tures, and find, towards the north
pole, what our Creator never intended
we ſhould, a paſſage to India. An
expedition was now fitting out to ex-
plore a north-eaſt paſſage, conducted
by the Honourable Conſtantine John
Phipps, fince Lord Mulgrave, in his
Majeſty's ſloop of war the Race Horſe.
My maſter being anxious for the re-
putation of this adventure, we therefore
prepared every thing for our voyage,
and I attended him on board the Race
Horſe, the 24th day of May, 1773.
We proceeded to Sheerneſs, where we
were joined by his Majeſty's ſloop
the Carcaſs, commanded by Captain
Lutwidge. On the 4th of June, we
failed towards our deſtined place, the
- F 6 pole;

<page 425>

[ to8. I
pole; and on the 15th of the ſame
month we were off Shetland. On this
day I had a great and unexpected de-
liverance from an accident which was
near blowing up the ſhip and deſtroy-
ing the crew, which made me ever
after during the voyage uncommonly
cautious. The ſhip was ſo filled that
there was very little room on board
for any one, which placed me in avery
aukward ſituation. I had reſolved to
keep a journal of this ſingular and in-
tereſting voyage; and I had no other
place for this purpoſe but a little
cabin, or the doćtor's ſtore-room,
where I ſlept. This little place was
ſtuffed with all manner of combuſtibles,
particularly with tow and aquafortis,
and many other dangerous things. Un-
fortunately it happened in the evening
as I was writing my journal, that I had
occaſion to take the candle out of the
- lanthorn,

<page 426>

[ Io9 |
lanthorn, and a ſpark having touched
a ſingle thread of the tow, all the reſt
caught the flame, and immediately the
whole was in a blaze. I ſaw nothing
but preſent death before me, and ex-
pected to be the firſt to periſh in the
flames. In a moment the alarm was
ſpread, and many people who were
near, ran to aſſiſt in putting out the
fire. All this time I was in the very
midſt of the flames; my ſhirt, and the
handkerchief on my neck, were burnt,
and I was almoſt ſmothered with the
ſmoke. However, through God's
mercy, as I was nearly giving up all
hopes, ſome people brought blankets
and mattreſſes and threw them on the
flames, by which means in a ſhort time
the fire was put out. I was ſeverely
reprimanded and menaced by ſuch of
the officers who knew it, and ſtrictly
charged never more to go there with a



light:

<page 427>

I to J
light; and, indeed, even my own ſtars
made me give heed to this command
for a little time; but at laſt, not being
able to write my journal in any other
part of the ſhip, I was tempted again
to venture by ſtealth with a light in
the ſame cabin, though not without
conſiderable fear and dread On my
mind. On the 20th of June, we began
to uſe Đr. Irving's apparatus for mak-
ing ſalt water freſh; I uſed to attend
the diſtillery: I frequently purified
from twenty-ſix to forty gallons a day.
The water thus diſtilled was perfectly
pure, well taſted, and free from ſalt;
and was uſed on various occaſions on
board the ſhip. On the 28th of June,
being in lat. 78, we made Greenland,
where I was ſurprized to ſee the ſun
did not ſet. The weather now became
extremely cold, and as we ſailed be-
tween north and caſt, which was our
courſe,

<page 428>

| 1 | 1 ||
courſe, we ſaw many very high and
curious mountains of ice; and alſo a
great number of very large whales,
which uſed to come cloſe to our ſhip,
and blow the water up to a very great
height in the air. One morning we
had vaſt quantities of ſea-horſes about
the ſhip, which neighed exactly like
any other horſes. We fired ſome har-
poon guns amongſt them, in order to
take ſome, but we could not get any.
The 30th, the captain of a Greenland
ſhip came on board, and told us of
three ſhips that were loſt in the ice;
however we ſtill held on our courſe till
July the 11th, when we were ſtopt by
one compact impenetrable body of
ice. We ran alongit from eaſt to weſt
above ten degrees; and on the 27th
we got as far north as 80, 37; and in
19 or 20 degrees; eaſt longitude from
London. On the 29th and 30th of


July,


<page 429>

[ 112 |
July, we ſaw one continued plain of
ſmooth unbroken ice, bounded only by
the horizon; and we faſtened to a
piece of ice that was eight yards eleven
inches thick. We had generally ſun-
ſhine, and conſtant daylight; which
gave cheerfulneſs and novelty to the
whole of this ſtriking, grand, and un-
common ſcene; and, to heighten it
ſtillmore, the reflection of the ſun from
the ice gave the clouds a moſt beau-
tiful appearance. We killed many dif-
ferent animals at this time, and among
the reſt nine bears. Though they had
nothing in their paunches but water yet
they were all very fat. We uſed to
decoy them to the ſhip ſometimes by
burning feathers of ſkins. I thought
them courſe eating, but ſome of the
ſhip's company reliſhed them very
much. Some of our people once, in
the boat, fired at and wounded a ſea-
3 horſe,


<page 430>

[ 113 J
horſe, which dived immediately; and
in a little time after, brought up with
it a number of others. They all joined
in an attack upon the boat, and were
with difficulty prevented from ſtaving
or overſetting her; but a boat from the
Carcaſs having come to aſſiſt ours, and
joined it, they diſperſed, after having
wreſted an oar from one of the men.
One of the ſhip's boats had before
been attacked in the ſame manner, but
happily no harm was done. Though
we wounded ſeveral of theſe animals
we never got but one. We remained
hereabouts until the 1ſt of Auguſt;
when the two ſhips got completely
faſtened in the ice, occaſioned by the
looſe ice that ſet in from the ſea. This
made our ſituation very dreadful and
alarming; ſo that on the 7th day, we
were in very great apprehenſion of
having the ſhips ſqueezed to pieces.
The

<page 431>
[ 114
The officers now held a council to
know what was beſt for us to do in
order to ſave our lives; and it was de-
termined that we ſhould endeavour to
eſcape by dragging our boats along
the ice towards the ſea; which, how-
ever, was farther off than any of us
thought. This determination filled
us with extreme dejection, and con-
founded us with deſpair; for we had
very little proſpect of eſcaping with
life. However, we ſawed ſome of the
ice about the ſhips, to keep it from
hurting them; and thus kept them in
a kind of pond. We then began to
drag the boats as well as we could to-
wards the ſea; but, after two or three
days labour, we made very little pro-
greſs; ſo that ſome of our hearts to-
tally failed us, and I really began to give
up myſelf for loſt, when I ſaw our fur-
rounding calamities. While we were
al
-


<page 432>

[ ſ 15
at this hard labour, I once fell into a
pond we had made amongſt ſome looſe
ice, and was very near being drowned;
but providentially ſome people were near
who gave me immediate aſſiſtance, and
thereby I eſcaped drowning. Our de-
plorable condition, which kept up the
conſtant apprehenſion of our periſhing
in the ice, brought me gradually to
think of eternity in ſuch a manner as I
never had done before. I had the
fears of death hourly upon me, and
ſhuddered at the thoughts of meeting
the grim king of terrors in the matu-
ral ſtate I then was in, and was ex-
ceedingly doubtful of a happy eternity
if I ſhould die in it. I had no hopes
of my life being prolonged for any
time; for we ſaw that our exiſtence
could not belong on the ice after leav-
ing the ſhips, which were now out of
fight, and ſome miles from the boats.
Our


<page 433>

[ 116
Our appearance now became truly la-
mentable; pale dejection ſeized every
countenance; many, who had been
before blaſphemers, in this our diſtreſs
began to call on the good God of hea-
ven for his help; and in the time of
our utter need he heardus, and againſt
hope or human probability, delivered
us! It was the eleventh day of the
ſhips being thus faſtened, and the
fourth of our drawing the boats in this
manner, that the wind changed to the
E. N. E. The weather immediately
became mild, and the ice broke to-
wards the ſea, which was to the S. W.
of us. Many of us on this got on
board again, and with all our might
we hove the ſhips into every open
water we could find, and made all the
ſail on them in our power: and now,
having a proſpect of ſucceſs, we made
ſignals for the boats and the *
O

<page 434>

[ 117
of the people. This ſeemed to us like
a reprieve from death; and happy was
the man who could firſt get on board
of any ſhip, or the firſt boat he could
meet. We then proceeded in this
manner till we got into the open water
again, which we accompliſhed in about
thirty hours, to our infinite joy and
gladneſs of heart. As ſoon as we were
out of danger, we came to anchor and
refitted; and on the 19th of Auguſt,
we ſailed from this uninhabited extre-
mity of the world, where the inhoſ-
pitable climate affords neither food
nor ſhelter, and not a tree or ſhrub of
any kind grows amongſt its barren
rocks; but all is one deſolate and ex-
panded waſte of ice, which even the
conſtant beams of the ſun for ſix
months in the year, cannot penetrate
or diſſolve. The ſun now being on
the decline, the days ſhortened as

We

<page 435>

[ 118 J
we ſailed to the ſouthward; and, on
the 28th, in latitude 73, it was dark
by ten o'clock at night. September
the Ioth, in latitude 58–59, we met a
very ſevere gale of wind and high ſeas,
and ſhipped a great deal of water in the
ſpace of ten hours. This made us
work exceedingly hard at all our pumps
a whole day; and one ſea, which
ſtruck the ſhip with more force than
anything I ever met with of the kind
before, laid her under water for ſome
time, ſo that we thought ſhe would have
gone down. Two boats were waſhed
from the booms, and the long-boat
from the chucks: all other moveable
things on the decks were alſo waſhed
away, among which were many curious
things of different kinds which we had
brought from Greenland; and we
were obliged, in order to lighten the
hip, to toſs ſome of our guns over-
board.

board. We ſaw a ſhip at the ſame
time, in very great diſtreſs, and her
maſts were gone; but we were unable
to aſſiſt her. We now loſt fight of the
Carcaſs till the 26th, when we ſaw
land about Orfordneſs, off which place
ſhe joined us. From thence we ſailed
for London, and on the 30th came up
to Deptford. And thus ended our
Arctic voyage, to the no ſmall joy of
all on board, after having been abſent
four months; in which time, at the
imminent hazard of our lives, we ex-
plored nearly as far towards the Pole
as 81 degrees north, and 20 degrees
eaſt longitude; being much farther,
by all accounts, than any navigator had
ever ventured before; in which we
fully proved the impracticability of
finding a paſſage that way to India.

proved afterwards a mercy to me; it
cauſed me to reflect deeply on my
eternal ſtate, and to ſeek the Lord with
full purpoſe of heart ere it was too
late. I rejoiced greatly; and heartily
thanked the Lord for directing me to
London, where I was determined to
work out my own ſalvation, and in ſo
doing, procure a title to heaven; being
the reſult of a mind blended by igno-
rance and ſin.
In proceſs of time I left my maſter,
Doctor Irving, the purifier of waters.
I lodged in Coventry-court, Hay-
market, where I was continually op-
preſſed and much concerned about the
ſalvation of my ſoul, and was deter-
mined (in my own ſtrength) to be a
firſt-rate Chriſtian. I uſed every means
for this purpoſe; and, not being able
to find any perſon amongſt thoſe with
Vol. Iſ. G whom


<page 439>

[ 122 J
whom I was then acquainted that ac-
quieſced with me in point of religion,
or, in ſcripture language, that would
ſhew me any good, I was much de-
jected, and knew not where to ſeek
relief; however, I firſt frequented the
heighbou ring churches, St.James's, and
others, two or three times a day, for
many weeks: ſtill I cameaway diſſatis-
fied: ſomething was wanting that I
could not obtain, and I really found
more heart-felt relief in reading my
bible at home than in attending the
church; and, being reſolved to be ſaved,
Ipurſued other methods. Firſt I went
among the quakers, where the word of
God was neither read or preached, ſo
that I remained as much in the dark
as ever. I then ſearched into the Re-
man catholic principles, but was not in
the leaſt edified. I at length had re-
courſe to the Jews, which availed me
nothing,

<page 440>

[ 123 J
nothing, as the fear of eternity daily
haraſſed my mind, and I knew not
where to ſeek ſhelter from the wrath
to come. However this was my con-
cluſion, at all events, to read the four
evangeliſts, and whatever ſect or party
I found adhering thereto, ſuch I would
join. Thus I went on heavily without
any guide to direct me the way that
leadeth to eternal life. I aſked dif-
ferent people queſtions about the man-
ner of going to heaven, and was told
different ways. Here I was much ſtag-
gered, and could not find any at that
time more righteous than myſelf, or in-
deed ſo much inclined to devotion. I
thought we ſhould notall be ſaved (this
is agreeable to the holy ſcriptures) nor
would all be damned. I found none
among the circle of my acquaintance
that kept wholly the ten command-
ments. So righteous was I in my own
G 2 eyes,


<page 441>

[ 124 J
eyes, that I was convinced I excelled
many ofthem in that point, by keeping
eight out often; and finding thoſe who
In general termed themſelves Chriſtians
not ſo honeſtorſogood in their morals
as the Turks, Ireally thought the Turks
were in a ſafer way of ſalvation than
my neighbours: ſo that between hopes
and fears I went on, and the chief.com-
forts I enjoyed were in the muſical
French horn, which I then practiſed,
and alſo dreſſing of hair. Such was
my ſituationſome months, experiencing
the diſhoneſty of many people here. I
determined at laſt to ſet out for Turkey,
and there to end my days. It was now
carly in the ſpring 1774. I ſought for
a maſter, and found a captain John
Hughes, commander of a ſhip called
Anglicania, fitting out in the river
Thames, and bound to Smyrna in Tur-
key. I ſhipped myſelf with him as

ed to him a very clever black man,
John Annis, as a cook. This man was
on board the ſhip near two months do–
ing his duty: he had formerly lived
many years with Mr. William Kirk-
patrick, agentleman of the iſland of St.
Kitts, from whom he parted by con–
ſent, though he afterwards tried many
ſchemes to inveigle the poor man. He
had applied to many captains who
traded to St. Kitts to trepan him; and
when all their attempts and ſchemes of
kidnapping proved abortive, Mr. Kirk–
patrick came to our ſhip at Union
Stairs, on Eaſter Monday, April the
fourth, with two wherry boats and ſix
men, having learned that the man was
on board; and tied, and forcibly took
him away from the ſhip, in the preſence
of the crew and the chief mate, who had
detained him after he had information

to come away. I believe this was a
combined piece of buſineſs: but, be
that as it may, it certainly reflected
great diſgrace on the mate and captain
alſo, who, although they had deſired the
oppreſſed man to ſtay onboard, yet this
vile act on the man who had ſerved
him, he did not in the leaſt aſſiſt to re-
cover or pay me a farthing of his
wages, which was about five pounds.
I proved the only friend he had, who
attempted to regain him his liberty if
poſſible, having known the want of li-
berty myſelf. I ſent as ſoon as I could
to Graveſend, and got knowledge of the
ſhip in which he was ; but unluckily
ſhe had ſailed the firſt tide after he was
put on board. My intention was then
immediately to apprehend Mr. Kirk-
patrick, who was about ſetting off for
Scotland; and, having obtained a ha-
Beas corpus for him, and got a tipſtaff to

where he lived, he, ſuſpecting ſome-
thing of this kind, ſet a watch to look
out. My being known to them, obliged
me to uſe the following deception: 1
whitened my face, that they might not
know me, and this had the deſired effect.
He did not go out of his houſe that
night, and next morning I contrived a
well plotted ſtratagem, notwithſtanding
he had a gentleman in his houſe to
perſonate him. My direction to the tip-
ſtaff, who got admittance into the houſe,
was to conduct him to a judge, accord-
ing to the writ. When he came there,
his plea was, that he had not the body
in cuſtody, on which he was admitted
to bail. I proceeded immediately to
that well known philanthropiſt, Gran-
ville Sharp, Eſq. who received me with
the utmoſt kindneſs, and gave me
every inſtruction that was needful on

the occaſion. I left him in full hope
that I ſhould gain the unhappy man
his liberty, with the warmeſt ſenſe
of gratitude towards Mr. Sharp, for
his kindneſs; but alas! my attor-
ney proved unfaithful; he took my
money, loſt me many months em-
ploy, and did not do the leaſt good in
the cauſe; and when the poor manar-
rived at St. Kitts, he was, according to
cuſtom, ſtaked to the ground with four
pins through a cord, two on his wriſts,
and two on his ancles, was cut and flog-
ged moſt unmercifully, and afterwards
loaded cruelly with irons abouthis neck.
I had two very moving letters from
him, while he was in this ſituation; and
made attempts to go after him ata great
hazard, but was ſadly diſappointed: I
alſo was told of it by ſome very reſpec-
table families now in London, who ſaw
him in St. Kitts, in the ſame ſtate, in
which he remained till kind death re-
leaſed


<page 446>

[ 129 |
leaſed him out of the hands of his ty-
rants. During this diſagreeable buſi-
neſs I was under ſtrong convictions of
ſin, and thought that my ſtate was worſe
than any man's ; my mind was unac-
countably diſturbed; I often wiſhed for
death, though at the ſame time con-
vinced I was altogether unprepared for
that awful ſummons. Suffering much
by villains in the late cauſe, and being
much concerned about the ſtate of my
ſoul, theſe things (but particularly the
latter) brought me very low; ſo that I
became a burden to myſelf, and viewed
all things around me as emptineſs and
vanity, which could give no ſatisfaction
to a troubled conſcience. I was again
determined to go to Turkey, and re-
ſolved, at that time, never more to
return to England. I engaged as ſteward
on board a Turkeyman (the Weſter
Hall, Capt. Lina) but was prevented
by means of my late captain, Mr.
Hughes, and others. All this appeared
G 5 to

to be againſt me, and the only comfort
I then experienced was, in reading the
holy ſcriptures, where I ſaw that ºthere
“is no new thing under the ſun, Ec-
cleſ. i. 9; and what was appointed for
me I muſt ſubmit to. Thus I continued
to travel in much heavineſs, and fre-
quently murmured againſt the Al-
mighty, particularly in his providential
dealings; and, awful to think I be-
gan to blaſpheme, and wiſhed often to
be any thing but a human being. In
theſe ſevere conflicts the Lord anſwered
me by awful viſions of the night,
* when deep ſleep falleth upon men, in
ſlumberings upon the bed,” Job ºxiii.
15. He was pleaſed, in much mercy,
to give me to ſee, and in ſome mea-
ſure underſtand, the great and awful
ſcene of the judgment-day, that “no

enter into the kingdom of God, PPh.

fible, have changed my nature with the
meaneſt worm on the earth; and was
ready to ſay to the mountains and rocks
* fall on me,’ Rev. vi. 16; but all in
vain. I then in the greateſt agony
requeſted the divine Creator, that he
would grant me a ſmall ſpace of
time to repent of my follies and vile
iniquities, which I felt were grievous.
The Lord, in his manifold mercies, was
pleaſed to grant my requeſt, and being
yet in a ſtate of time the ſenſe of God's
mercies were ſo greaton my mind when
I awoke, that my ſtrength entirely fail-
led me formany minutes, and I was ex-
ceedingly weak. This was the firſt
ſpiritual mercy I ever was ſenſible of,
and being on praying ground, as ſoon
as I recovered a little ſtrength, and got
out of bed and dreſſed myſelf, I invoked
Heaven from my inmoſt ſoul, and fer-
vently begged that God would never

again permit me to blaſpheme his moſt
holy name. The Lord, who is long-
ſuffering, and full ofcompaſſion to ſuch
poor rebels as we are, condeſcended to
hear and anſwer. I felt that I was al-
together unholy, and ſaw clearly what
a bad uſe I had made of the faculties I
was endowed with: they were given me
to glorify God with; I thought, there-
fore, I had better want them here, and
cnter into life eternal, than abuſe them
and be caſt into hell fire. I prayed to
be directed, if there were any holier
than thoſe with whom I was acquaint-
cd, that the Lord would pointhem out
to me. I appealed to the Searcher of
hearts, whether I did not wiſh to love
him more, and ſerve him better. Not-
withſtanding all this, the reader may ca-
fily diſcern, ifa believer, that I was ſtill
in nature's darkneſs. At length! º

the houſe in which I lodged, becauſe
God's moſt holy name was blaſphemed
in it; then I ſaw the word of God ve—
rified, viz. Before they call, I will
“anſwer; and while they are yet ſpeak-
‘ing, I will hear.”
I had a great deſire to read the bible
the whole day at home; but not having
a convenient place for retirement, I left
the houſe in the day, rather than ſtay
amongſt the wicked ones; and that day
as I was walking, it pleaſed God to
direct me to a houſe where there was an
old ſea-faring man, who experienced
much of the love of God ſhed abroad in
his heart. He began to diſcourſe with
me; and, as I deſired to love the Lord,
his converſation rejoiced me greatly;
and indeed I had never heard before
the love of Chriſt to believers ſet forth
in ſuch a manner, and in ſo clear a point
of view. Here I had more queſtions to
put


<page 451>

| 134 |
put to the man than his time would per-
mit him to anſwer: and in that memor-
able hour there came in a diſſenting
miniſter; he joined our diſcourſe, and
aſked me ſome few queſtions; among
others, where I heard the goſpel
preached? I knew not what he meant
by hearing the goſpel; I told him I had
read the goſpel: and he aſked where I
went to church, or whether I went at
all or not? To which I replied 1
‘attended St. James's, St. Martin's, and
“St. Ann's Soho;'— So, ſaid he, you
* are a churchman?' I anſwered, I
was. He then invited me to a love-
feaſt at his chapel that evening. I ac-
cepted the offer, and thanked him;
and ſoon after he went away, I had
ſome furtherdiſcourſe with thcold Chriſ-
tian, added to ſome profitable read-
ing, which made me exceedingly hap-
py. When I left him he reminded me
of


<page 452>

[ 135

of coming to the feaſt; I aſſured him
I would be there. Thus we parted, and
I weighed over the heavenly conver-
ſation that had paſſed between theſe two
men, which cheered mythen heavy and
drooping ſpirit more than anything I
had met with for many months. How-
ever, I thought the time long in going
to my ſuppoſed banquet. I alſo wiſhed
much for the company of theſe friendly
men; their company pleaſed me much;
and I thought the gentleman very kind
in aſking me, a ſtranger, to a feaſt;
but how ſingular did it appear to me,
to have it in a chapel. When the wiſh-
edfor hour came I went, and happily the
old man was there, who kindly ſcated
me, as he belonged to the place. I was
much aſtoniſhed to ſee the place filled
with people, and no ſigns of eating and
drinking. There were many miniſters
in the company. At laſt they began

by

<page 453>

| 136
by giving out hymns, and between the
ſinging, the miniſters engaged in prayer:
in ſhort, I knew not what to make of
this fight, having never ſeen anything
of the kind in my life before now.
Some of the gueſts began to ſpeak their
experience, agreeable to what I read
in the Scriptures: much was ſaid by
every ſpeaker of the providence of
God, and his unſpeakable mercies, to
each of them. This I knew in a great
meaſure, and could moſt heartily join
them. But when they ſpoke of a future
ſtate, they ſeemed to be altogether cer–
tain of their calling and election of God;
and that no one could ever ſepcrate
them from the love of Chriſt, or pluck
them out of his hands. This filled me
withºutter conſternation, intermingled
with admiration. I was ſo amazed as
not to know what to think of the com-
pany; my heart was attracted, and my
affections


<page 454>

| 137 J
affections were enlarged. I wiſhed to be
as happy as them, and was perſuaded in
my mind thatthey were different fromthe
world ‘thatlicthin wickedneſs, 1 John
v. 19. Their language and finging,
&c. did well harmonize; I was entirely
overcome, and wiſhed to live and die
thus. Laſtly, ſome perſons in the place
produced ſome neatbaſkets full ofbuns,
which they diſtributed about; and each
perſoncommunicated with his neighbour,
and fipped water out of different mugs,
which they handed about to all who were
preſent. This kind of Chriſtian fellow-
ſhip I had never ſeen, nor ever thought
of ſeeing on earth; it fully reminded me
of what I had read in the holy ſcrip-
tures, of the primitive Chriſtians, who
loved each other and broke bread ;
in partaking of it, even from houſe
to houſe. This entertainment (which
laſted about four hours) ended in fing-


ing

ing and prayer. It was the firſt ſoul
feaſt I ever was preſent at. This laſt
twenty-four hours produced methings,
ſpiritual and temporal, ſleeping and
waking, judgment and mercy, that I
could not but admire the goodneſs of
God, in directing the blind, blaſphem-
eus ſinner in the path that he knew not
of even among the juſt; and inſtead of
judgmenthe has ſhewedmercy, and will
hear and anſwer the prayers and ſup-
plications of every returning prodigal:
O! to grace how great a debtor -
Daily I'm conſtrain'd to be

After this I was reſolved to win Hea-
ven if poſſible; and if I periſhed I
thought it ſhould be at the feet of Jeſus,
in praying to him for ſalvation. After
having been an eye-witneſs to ſome of
the happineſs which attended thoſe who
feared God, I knew not how, with any
propriety


<page 456>

| 139 l
propriety, to return to my lodgings,
where the name of God was continually
profaned, at which I felt the greateſt
horror; I pauſed in my mind for ſome
time, not knowing what to do; whe-
ther to hire a bed elſewhere, or go
home again. At laſt fearing an evil
report might ariſe, I went home, with
a farewel to card-playing and vain jeſt-
ing, &c. I ſaw that time was very
ſhort, eternity long, and very near ; and
I viewed thoſe perſons alone bleſſed
who were found ready at midnight call,
or when the judge of all, both quick
and dead, cometh.
The next day I took courage, and
went to Holborn, to ſee my new
and worthy acquaintance, the old man,
Mr. C ; he, with his wife, a gra-
cious woman, were at work at ſilk
weaving; they ſeemed mutually happy,
and both quite glad to ſee me, and I

more ſo to ſee them. I ſat down and
we converſed much aboutſoul matters,
&c. Their diſcourſe was amazingly de-
lightful, edifying, and pleaſant. I knew
not at laſt how to leave this agreeable
pair, till time ſummoned me away. As
I was going they lent me a little book,
entitled “The converſion of an In-
“dian.” It was in queſtions and
anſwers. The poor man came over the
ſea to London, to inquire after the
Chriſtian's God, who, (through rich
mercy) he found, and had not his jour-
ney in vain. The above book was of
great uſe to me, and at that time was a
means of ſtrengthening my faith; how-
ever, in parting, they both invited me
to call on them when I pleaſed. This
delighted me, and I took care to make
all the improvement from it 1 could :
and ſo far I thanked God for ſuch com-

pany and deſires. I prayed that the
many


<page 458>

[ 141 l
many evils I felt within might be done
away, and that I might be weaned from
my former carnal acquaintances. This
was quickly heard and anſwered, and I
was ſoon connected with thoſe whom the
ſcripture calls the excellent of the earth.
I heard the goſpel preached, and the
thoughts of my heart and actions were
laid open by the preachers, and the way
of ſalvation by Chriſt alone was evi-
dently ſet forth. Thus I went on hap-
pily for near two months; and I once
heard, during this period, a reverend
gentleman Mr. G. ſpeak of a man who
had departed this life in full aſſurance
of his going to glory I was much aſto-
niſhed at the aſſertion; and did very
deliberately inquire how he could get
at this knowledge. I was anſwered
fully, agreeable to what I read in the
oracles of truth; and was told alſo, that
if I did not experience the new birth,

and the pardon of my fins, through the
blood of Chriſt, before I died, I could
not enter the kingdom of heaven. I
knew not what to think of this report,
as Ithought I kepteight commandments
out of ten; then my worthy interpreter
told me I did not do it, nor could I;
and he added, that no man ever did or
could keep the commandments, with-
out offending in one point. Ithought
this ſounded very ſtrange, and puzzled
me much for many weeks; for I thought
it a hard ſaying. I then aſked my
friend Mr. L-d, who was a clerk
in a chapel, why the commandments of
God were given, if we could not be
ſaved by them To which he replied,
• The law is a ſchoolmaſter to bring us
to Chriſt, who alone could and did
keep the commandments, and fulfilled
all their requirements for his elect
people, eventhoſe to whom he had given

a living faith, and the fins of thoſe
choſen veſſels were already atoned for
and forgiven them whilſt living; and
if I did not experience the ſame before
my exit, the Lord would ſay at that
great day to me, ‘Go, ye curſed,’ &c.
&c. for God would appear faithful in
his judgments to the wicked, as he
would be faithful in ſhewing mercy to
thoſe were ordained to it before the
world was; therefore Chriſt Jeſus ſeem-
ed to be all in all to that man’s ſoul. I
was much wounded at this diſcourſe,
and brought into ſuch a dilemma as I
never expected. I aſked him, if he was
to die that moment, whether he was
ſure to enter the kingdom of God? and
added, “Do you know that your fins
are forgiven you?' He anſwered in the
affirmative. Then confuſion, anger,
and diſcontent ſeized me, and I ſtag-
gered much at this ſort of doćtrine; it
brought

<page 461>

ſ 144 )
brought me to a ſtand, not knowing
which to believe, whether ſalvation by
works, or by faith only in Chriſt. I
requeſted him to tell me how I might
know when my fins were forgiven me.
He aſſured me he could not, and that
none but God alone could do this. I
told him it was very myſterious; but
he ſaid it was really matter of fact,
and quoted many portions of ſcripture
immediately to the point, to which I,
could make no reply. He then deſired
me to pray to God to ſhew me theſe
things. I anſwered, that I prayed to
God every day? He ſaid, ‘I perceive
“you are a churchman. I anſwered,
I was. He then entreated me to begof
God to ſhew mewhat I was, and the true
ſtate of my ſoul. I thought the prayer
very ſhort and odd; ſo we parted for
that time. I weighed all theſe things
well over, and could not help thinking
how it was poſſible for a man to know
that

<page 462>

145 )
that his fins were forgiven him in this
life. I wiſhed that God would reveal
this ſelfſame thing unto me. In a ſhort
time after this I went to Weſtminſter
chapel; the Rev. Mr. P preached
from Lam. iii. 39. It was a wonderful
ſermon; he clearly ſhewed that a living
man had no cauſe to complain for the
puniſhments of his fins; he evidently
juſtified the Lord in all his dealings
with the ſons of men; he alſo ſhewed
the juſtice of God in the eternal puniſh-
ment of the wicked and impenitent.
The diſcourſe ſeemed to melike a two-
edged ſword cutting all ways; it afforded
me much joy, intermingled with many
fears about my ſoul; and when it was
ended, he gave it out that he intended,
the enſuing week, to examine all thoſe
who meant to attend the Lord’s table.
Now I thought much of my good
works, and at the ſame time was doubt-
Vol. II. H ful

<page 463>

- [ 146
ºf my being a proper object to re-
ceive the ſacrament ; I was full of me-
ditation tiſſ the day of examining.
However, I went to the chapel, and,
though much diſtreſſed, I addreſſed the
reverend gentleman, thinking if I was
not right, he would endeavour to con-
vince meofit. When I converſed with
him, the firſt thing he aſked me, Was,
what I knew of Chriſt? I told him I
believed in him, and had been baptized
in his name. Then, ſaid he, when
“were you brought to the knowledge of
“God? and how were you convinced of
fin” I knew not what he meant by
theſe queſtions; I told him I kepteight
commandments out of ten; but that I
ſometimes ſwore on board ſhip, and
ſometimes when on ſhore, and broke the
ſabbath. He then aſked meif I could
read? I anſwered, ‘Yes.”— Then,"
ſaid he, do you not read in the bible,

[ 147 |

he that offends in one point is guilty
* of all?' I ſaid, ‘Yes." Then he aſ-
ſured me, that one ſinunatoned for was
as ſufficient to damn a ſoul as one leak
was to fink a ſhip. Here I was ſtruck
with awe; for the miniſter exhorted
me much, and reminded me of the
fhortneſs of time, and the length of
eternity, and that mountegenerate ſoul,
or anything unclean, could enter the
kingdom of Heaven.
He did not admit me as a commu-
nicant; but recommended me to read
the ſcriptures, and hear the wordpreach-
ed, not to neglect ſervent prayer to God,
who has promiſed to hear the ſuppli-
cations of thoſe who ſeek him in godly
fincerity; ſo took my leave of him,
with many thanks, and reſolved to ſol-
low his advicº, ſofar as the Lord would
condeſcend to enable me. During this
time I was out of employ, nor was I
H 2 likely

likely to get a ſituation ſuitable for mº,
which obliged me to go once more
to ſea. I engaged as ſteward of a ſhip
called the Hope, Capt. Richard Strange,
bound from London to Cadiz in Spain.
In a ſhort time after I was on board I
heard the name of God much-blaſ-
phemed, and I feared greatly, left I
ſhould catch the horrible infection. I
thought if I finned again, after having
life and death ſet evidently before me,
I ſhould certainly go to hell. My mind
was uncommonlychagrined, and Imur-
mured much at God’s providentialdeal-
ings with me, and was diſcontented
with the commandments, that I could
not be ſaved by what I had done; I
hated all things, and wiſhed I had never
been born; confuſion ſeized me, and I
wiſhed to be annihilated. One day I
was ſtanding on the very edge of the
ſtern of the ſhip, thinking to drown

myſelf, but this ſcripture was inſtantly
impreſſed on my mind—“That no mur-
‘derer hath eternal life abiding in him,'
1 John iii. 15. Then I pauſed, and
thought myſelf the unhappieſt man liv-
ing. Again I was convinced that the
Lord was better to me than I deſerved,
and I was better off in the world than
many. After this I begantofear death;
I fretted, mourned, and prayed, till I
became a burden to others, but more
ſo to myſelf. At length I concluded
to beg my bread on ſhore rather than
go again to ſea amongſt a people who
feared not God, and I entreated the
captain three different times to diſ-
charge me; he would not, but each
time gavemegreater and greater encou-
ragement to continue with him, and all
onboard ſhewed me very great civility:
notwithſtanding all this I was unwilling
to embark again. At laſt ſome of my

so I
religious friends adviſed me, by ſaying
it was my lawful calling, conſequently
it was my duty to obey, and that God
was not confined to place, &c. &c, par-
ticularly Mr. G. S. the governor of
Tothil-fields Bridewell, who pitied my
caſe, and read the eleventh chapter of
the Hebrews to me, with exhortations.
He prayed for me, and I believed that
he prevailed on my behalf, as my bur-
den was then greatly removed, and I
found a heartfelt reſignation to the will
of God. The good man gave me a
pocket Bible and Alleine's Alarm to the
Unconverted. We parted, and the next
day I went on board again. We ſailed
for Spain, and I found favour with the
captain. It was the fourth ofthe month
of September when we ſailed from Lon-
don; we had a delightful voyage to
Cadiz, where we arrived the twenty-
third of the ſame month. The place

is ſtrong, commands a fine proſpett, and
is very rich. The Spaniſh galloons
frequent that port, and ſome arrived
whilſt we were there. I had many op-
portunities of reading the ſcriptures. I
wreſtled hard with God in fervent
prayer, who had declared in his word
that he would hear the groanings and
deep ſighs of the poor inſpirit iſ found
this verified to my utter aſtoniſhment
and comfort in the following manner:
On the morning of the 6th of October,
(I pray you to attend) all that day, I
thought that I ſhould either fedorhear
ſomething ſupernatural. I had a ſecret
impulſe on my mind of ſomethiug that
was to take place, which drove me conti-
nually for that time to a throne of grace.
It pleaſed God to enable me to wreſtle
with him, as Jacob did: I prayed that
if ſudden death were to happen, and I
periſhed, it might be at Chriſt's feet.

In the evening of the ſame day, as I
was reading and meditating on thefourth
chapter of the Aéts, twelfth verſe, under
the ſolemn apprehenſions of eternity,
and reflecting on my paſt actions, I be-
gan to think I had lived a moral life,
and that I had a proper ground to be-
lieve I had an intereſt in the divine fa-
vour; but ſtill meditating on the ſubjećt,
not knowing whether ſalvation was to
be had partly for our own good deeds,
or ſolely as the ſovereign gift of God;—
in this deep conſternation the Lord was
pleaſed to break in upon my ſoul with
his bright beams of heavenly light; and
in an inſtant as it were, removing the
veil, and letting light into a darkplace,
I ſaw clearly with the eye of faith the
crucified Saviour bleeding on the croſs
on mount Calvary: the ſcriptures be-
came an unſealed book, I ſaw myſelf
a condemned criminal under the law,

which

<page 470>

which came with its full force to my
conſcience, and when the command-
‘ment came ſin revived, and I died.' I
ſaw the Lord Jeſus Chriſtin his humili-
ation, loaded and bearing my reproach,
ſin, and ſhame. Ithen clearly perceived
that by the deeds of the law no fleſh liv-
ing could be juſtified. I was then con-
vinced that by the firſt Adam fin came,
and by the ſecond Adam (the Lord Jeſus
Chriſt) all that are ſaved muſt be made
alive. It was given me at that time to
know what it was to be born again,
John iii. 5. I ſaw the eighth chapter to
the Romans, and the doctrines of God’s
decrees, verified agreeable to his eternal,
everlaſting, and unchangeable purpoſes.
The word of God was ſweet to my
taſte, yea ſweeter than honey and the
honeycomb. Chriſt was revealed to
my ſoul as the chiefeſt among ten
thouſand. Theſe heavenly moments

were really as life to the dead, and what
John calls an earneſt of the Spirit".
This was indeed unſpeakable, and I
firmly believe undeniable by many.
Now every leading providential cir-
cumſtance that happened to me, from
the day I was taken from my parents
to that hour, was then in my view,
as if it had but juſt then occurred.
I was ſenſible of the inviſible hand
of God, which guided and protected me
when in truth I knew it not: ſtill the

On my return I had but one text

much to hear him preach. One day
I went to Blackfriars church, and, to
my great ſatisfaction and ſurpriſe, he
preached from that very text. He
very clearly ſhewed the difference be-
tween human works and free election,
which is according to God’s ſovereign
will and pleaſure. Theſe glad tidings
ſet me entirely at liberty, and I went
out of the church rejoicing, ſeeing my
ſpots were thoſe of God's Children. I
went to Weſtminſter Chapel, and ſaw
ſome of my old friends, who were glad
when they perceived the wonderful

Reflections on the State of my Mind
during my firſt Convictions, of the
Neceſſity of believing the Truth,
and experiencing the ineſtimable
Benefits of Chriſtianity.
WELL may I ſay my life has been
One ſcene of ſorrow and of pain;
From early days I griefs have known,
And as I grew my griefs have grown:
Dangers were always in my path;
And fear of wrath, and ſometimes death;
While pale dejection in me reign'd
I often wept, by grief conſtrain'd.
When taken from my native land,
By an unjuſt and cruel band,
How did uncommon dread prevail!
My fighs no more I could conceal.
To eaſe my mind I often ſtrove, -
And tried my trouble to remove:
I ſung, and utter'd fighs between-
Affay'd to ſtifle guilt with fin. But

Clouded and darken'd moſt my years.

* Sighs now no more would be confin’d—
* They breath'd the trouble of my mind.”
I wiſh'd for death, but check'd the word,
And often pray'd untº the Lord.
Unhappy, more than ſome on earth,

we had a very good paſſage, without
any material accident, until we arrived
off the Bay of Cadiz, when one Sun-
day, juſt as we were going into the har-

to call on God to have mercy on them.
Although I could not ſwim, and ſaw
no way of eſcaping death, I felt no
dread in my then ſituation, having no
deſire to live. I even rejoiced in
ſpirit, thinking this death would be
ſudden glory. But the fulneſs of time
was not yet come. The people near to
me were much aſtoniſhed in ſeeing me
thus calm and reſigned ; but I told
them of the peace of God, which
through ſovereign grace I enjoyed, and

theſe words were that inſtant in my
mind:
“Chriſt is my pilot wiſe, my compaſs is his word;
“My ſoul each ſtorm defies, while I have ſuch a

“I truſt his faithfulneſs and power,

“Yet Chriſt ſhall ſafely keep and guide me with

** How can I fink with ſuch a prop,
“That bears the world and all things up?”
At this time there were many large
Spaniſh flukers or paſſage-veſſels full
of people croſſing the channel; who
ſeeing our condition, a number of them
came alongſide of us. As many hands
as could be employed began to work;
ſome at our three pumps, and the reſt
unloading the ſhip as faſt as poſſible.
There being only a ſingle rock called

aſhore at the neareſt place to keep her
from ſinking. After many tides, with
a great deal of care and induſtry, we
got her repaired again. When we had
diſpatched our buſineſs at Cadiz, we
went to Gibraltar, and from thence to
Malaga, a very pleaſant and rich city,
where there is one of the fineſ cathe-
drals I had ever ſeen. It had been above
fifty years in building, as I heard,
though it was not then quite finiſhed;
great parts of the inſide, however, was
completed and highly decorated with
the richeſt marble columns and many
ſuperb paintings; it was lighted occa-
ſionally by an amazing number of wax
tapers of different ſizes, ſome of which
were as thick as a man's thigh; theſe,
however, were only uſed on ſome of
their grand feſtivals.
I was very much ſhocked at the
cuſtom of bull-baiting, and other di-
verſions

verſions which prevailed here on Sun-
day evenings, to the great ſcandal of
Chriſtianity and morals. I uſed to ex-
preſs my abhorrence of it to a prieſt
whom I met with. I had frequent
conteſts about religion with the reve-
rend father, in which he took great
pains to make a proſelyte of me to his
church; and I no leſs to convert him
to mine. On theſe occaſions I uſed to
produce my Bible, and ſhew him in
what points his church erred. He
then ſaid he had been in England, and
that every perſon there read the Bible,
which was very wrong; but I anſwer-
ed him that Chriſt deſired us to ſearch
the Scriptures. In his zeal for my con-
verſion, he ſolicited me to gp to one
of the univerſities in Spain, and de-
clared that I ſhould have my educa-
tion free; and told me, if I got my-
ſelf made a prieſt, I might in time
become

<page 490>

| 173 J
become even pope; and that Pope
Benedićt was a black man. As I was
ever deſirous of learning, I pauſed for
ſome time upon this temptation; and
thought by being craſty I might catch
ſome with guile; but I began to think
that it would be only hypocriſy in me
to embrace his offer, as I could not
in conſcience conform to the opinions.
of his church. I was therefore enabled
to regard the word of God, which
ſays, “Come out from amongſt them,'
and refuſed Father Vincent's offer. So
we parted without conviction on ei-
ther ſide.
Having taken at this place ſome
fine wines, fruits, and money, we pro-
ceeded to Cadiz, where we took about
two tons more of money, &c. and then
ſailed for England in the month of
June. When we were about the north
latitude 42, we had contrary wind for
! 3 ſeveral





<page 491>

[ 174 |
ſeveral days, and the ſhip did not make
in that time above ſix or ſeven miles
ſtrait courſe. This made the Cap-
tain exceeding fretful and peewiſh:
and I was very ſorry to hear God's
moſt holy name often blaſphemed by
him. One day, as he was in that im-
pious mood, a young gentleman on
board, who was a paſſenger, reproached
him, and ſaid he acted wrong; for we
ought to be thankful to God for all
things, as we were not in want of any
thing on board; and though the wind
was contrary for us, yet it was fair for
ſome others, who, perhaps, ſtood in
more need of it than we. I imme-
diately ſeconded this young gentleman
with ſome boldneſs, and ſaid we had
not the leaſt cauſe to murmur, for
that the Lord was better to us than we
deſerved, and that he had done all
things well. I expected that the cap-
tain

<page 492>

I tº
tain would beveay angry with me for
ſpeaking, but he replied not a word.
However, before that time on the foll-
lowing day, being the 21ſt of June,
much to our great joy and aſtoniſh-
ment, we ſaw the providential hand of
our benign Creator, whoſe ways with
his blind creatures are paſt finding out.
The preceding night I dreamed that I
ſaw aboatimmediately ofthe ſtarboard
main ſhrouds; and exactly at halfpaſt
one o'clock, the following day at noon,
while I was below, juſt as we had
dined in the cabin, the man at the
helm cried out, A boat' which brought
my dream that inſtant into my mind.
I was the firſt man that jumped on
the deck; and lookingſrom the ſhrouds
onward, according to my dream, I
deſcried a little boat at ſome diſtance;
but, as the waves were high, it was as
much as we could do ſometimes to diſ-

cern her; we however ſtopped the ſhip's
way, and the boat, which was extreme-
ly ſmall, came alongſide with elevenmi-
ferable men, whom we took on board
immediately. To all human appear-
ance, theſe people muſt have periſhed
in the courſe of one hour or leſs,
the boat being ſmall, it barely con-
tained them. When we took them up
they were half drowned, and had no
vićtuals, compaſs, water, or any other
neceſſary whatſoever, and had only one
bit of an oar to ſteer with, and that
right before the wind; ſo that they
were obliged to truſt entirely to the
mercy of the waves. As ſoon as we
got them all on board, they bowed
themſelves on their knees, and, with
hands and voices lifted up to heaven,
thanked God for their deliverance;
and I truſt that my prayers were not
wanting amongſt them at the ſame

time. This mercy of the Lord quite
melted me, and I recollected his words,
which I ſaw thus verified in the Iojth
Pſalm, “O give thanks unto the Lord,
for he is good, for his mercy endureth
for ever. Hungry and thirſty, their
• ſouls fainted in them. They cried
unto the Lord in their trouble, and he
delivered them out oftheir diſtreſſeſs.

way, that they might go to a city

“ praiſe the Lord for his goodneſs and

ſoul with goodneſs.

in great waters: theſe ſee the works
of the Lord, and his wonders in the

the Lord.”
The poor diſtreſſed captain ſaid,
that the Lord is good; for, ſeeing
that I am not fit to die, he there-
fore gave me a ſpace of time to
repent.’ I was very glad to hear this
expreſſion, and took an opportunity
when convenient of talking to him on
the providence of God. They toldus
they were Portugueſe, and were in a
brig loaded with corn, which ſhifted
that morning at five o’clock, owing to
which the veſſel ſunk that inſtant with
two of the crew ; and how theſe eleven
got into the boat (which was laſhed to
the deck) not one of them could tell.
We

We provided them with every neceſ-
ſary, and brought them all ſafeto Lon-
don: and I hope the Lord gave them
repentance unto life eternal.
I was happy once more amongſt my
friends and brethren, till November,
when my old friend, the celebrated
Doctor Irving, bought a remarkable
fine ſloop, about I go tons. He had a
mind for a new adventure in cultivat-
ing a plantation at Jamaica, and the
Muſquito Shore; aſked me to go with
him, and ſaid that he would truſt -
me with his eſtate in preference to any
one. By the advice, therefore, of my
friends, I accepted of the oſſer, know-
ing that the harveſ was fully ripe in
thoſe parts, and hoped to be an in-
ſtrument under God, of bringing ſome
poor finner to my well beloved maſter,
Jeſus Chriſt. Before I embarked, I
found with the Doctor four Mºnito

Indians, who were chiefs in their own
country, and were brought here by
ſome Engliſh traders for ſome ſelfiſh
ends. One of them was the Muſquito
king's ſon; a youth of about eighteen
years of age; and whilſt he was here
he was baptized by the name of
George. They were going back at the
government's expenſe, after having
been in England about twelve months,
during which they learned to ſpeak
pretty good Engliſh. When I came
to talk to them about eight days before
we ſailed, I was very much mortified
in finding that they had not frequented
any churches ſince they were here, to
be baptized, nor was any attention
paid to their morals. I was very ſorry
ſor this mock Chriſtianity, and had juſt
an opportunity to take ſome of them
once to church before we ſailed. We

ing Star, Captain David Miller, and
failed for Jamaica. In our paſſage, I
took all the pains that I could to inſtruct
the Indian prince in the doctrines of
Chriſtianity, of which he was entirely
ignorant; and, to my great joy, he was
quite attentive, and received with glad-
neſs the truths that the Lord enabled
me to ſet forth to him. I taught him in
the compaſs of eleven days all the let-
ters, and he could put even two or
three of them together and ſpell them.
I had Fox's Martyrology with cuts,
and he uſed to be very fond of looking
into it, and would aſk many queſtions
about the papal cruelties he ſaw de-
pićted there, which I explained to him.
I made ſuch progreſs with this youth,
eſpecially in religion, that when I uſed
to go to bed at different hours of the
night, if he was in his bed, he would

as much as I could; but this treatment
cauſed the prince to halt between two
opinions. Some of the true ſons of
Belial, who did not believe that there
was any hereafter, told him never to
fear the devil, for there was none
exiſting; and if ever he came to the
prince, they deſired he might be
ſent to them. Thus they teazed the
poor innocent youth, ſo that he would
not learn his book any more! He would
not drink nor carouſe with theſe un-
godly actors, nor would he be with me,
even at prayers. This grieved me very
much. I endeavoured to perſuade him
as well as I could, but he would not
come; and entreated him very much to
tell me his reaſons for acting thus. At
laſt he aſked me, ‘How comes it that

was, that they did not fear God; and
that if any one of them died ſo they
could not goto, or behappy with God.
He replied, that if theſe perſons went
to hell he would go to hell too. I was
ſorry to hear this; and, as he ſome-
times had the tooth-ach, and alſo ſome
other perſons in the ſhip at the ſame
time, I aſked him if their tooth-ach
made his eaſy: he ſaid, No. Then I
told him if he and theſe people went to
hell together, their pains would not
make his any lighter. This anſwer had
great weight with him: it depreſſed
his ſpirits much ; and he became ever
after, during the paſſage, fond of being
alone. When we were in the latitude
of Martinico, and near making the
land, one morning we had a briſkgale
of

<page 502>

of wind, and, carrying too much ſail,
the main-maſt went over the fide.
Many people were then all about the
deck, and the yards, maſts, and rig-
ging, came tumbling all about us, yet
there was not one of us in the leaſt
hurt, although ſome were withina hair's
breadth of being killed: and, particu-
larly, I ſaw two men who, by the provi-
dential hand of God, were moſt miracu-
louſly preſerved from being ſmaſhed to
pieces. On the fifth of January we
made Antigua and Montſerrat, and ran
along the reſt of the iſlands: and on
the fourteenth we arrived at Jamaica.
One Sunday while we were there I took
the Muſquito Prince George to church,
where he ſaw the ſacrament adminiſ-
tered. When we came out we ſaw all
kinds of people, almoſt from the church
door for the ſpace of half a mile down
to the waterſide, buying and ſelling all
kinds

<page 503>

- [ 186
kinds of commodities; and theſe ags
afforded megreat matter of exhortation
to this youth, who was much aſtoniſhed.
Our veſſel being ready to ſail for the
Muſquito ſhore, I went with the Doºtor
on board a Guinea-man, to purchaſe
ſome ſlaves to carry with us, and cul-
tivate a plantation; and I choſe them
all my own countrymen. On the twelfth
of February we ſailed from Jamaica,
and on the eighteenth arrived at the
Muſquito ſhore, at a place called Du-
peupy. All our Indian gueſts now,
after I had admoniſhed them and a few
caſes of liquor given them by the Doc-
tor, took an affectionate leave of us, and
went aſhore, where they were met by
the Muſquito king, and we never ſaw
one of them afterwards. We then ſailed
to the ſouthward of the ſhore, to a
place called Cape Gracias a Dios,
where there was a large lagoon or
lake,

<page 504>

* 187
lake, which received the emptying of
two or three very fine large rivers, and
abounded much in fiſh and land tor-
toiſe. Some of the native Indians came
on board ofus here; and we uſed them
well, and told them we were come to
dwell amongſt them, which they ſeemed
pleaſed at. So the Doctor and I, with
ſome others, went with them aſhore;
and they took us to different places to
view the land, in order to chooſe a
place to make a plantation of Wefixed
on a ſpot near a river's bank, in a rich
ſoil; and, having gotour neceſſaries out
of the ſloop, we began to clear away
the woods, and plant different kinds of
vegetables, which had a quick growth.
While we were employed in this man-
ner, our veſſel went northward to Black
River to trade. While ſhe was there,
a Spaniſh guarda coſta met with and
took her. This proved very hurtful,
- - and

<page 505>

and a greatembarraſſment to us. How.
ever, we went on with the culture of
the land. We uſed to make fires every
night all around us, to keep off wild
beaſts, which, as ſoon as it was dark,
ſet up a moſt hideous roaring. Our
habitation being far up in the woods,
we frequently ſaw different kinds of
animals; but none of them ever hurt
us, except poiſonous ſnakes, the bite of
which the Doctor uſed to cure by giving
to the patient as ſoon as poſſible, about
half a tumbler of ſtrong rum, with a
good deal of Cayenne pepper in it. In
this manner he cured two natives and
one of his own ſlaves. The Indians
were exceedingly fond of the Doctor,
and they had good reaſon for it; for
believethey never had ſuch an uſefulman
amongſt them. They came from all quar-
ters to our dwelling; and ſome woºlwº
or flat-headed Indians, who lived fifty or
ſixty

<page 506>

[ 189 J
fixty miles above our river, and this fide.
of the South Sea, brought us a good
deal of ſilver in exchange for our goods.
The principal articles we could get
from our neighbouring Indians, were
turtle oil, and ſhells, little ſilk graſs,
and ſome proviſions; but they would
not work at any thing for us, except
fiſhing; and a few times they aſfiſt-
td to cut ſome trees down, in order
to build us houſes; which they did
exactly like the Africans, by the joint
labour of men, women, and children.
I do not recollect any of them to have
hadmore than two wives. Theſe always
accompanied their huſbands when they
came to our dwelling, and then they
generally carried whateverthey brought
to us, and always ſquatted down behind
their huſbands. Whenever we gave
them anything to eat, the men and their
wives eat ſeperate. I never ſaw the
leaſt

<page 507>

leaſt ſign of incontinence amongſt
them. The womenareornamented with
beads, and fond of painting themſelves;
the men alſo paint, even to exceſs, both
their faces and ſhirts: their favourite
colour is red. The women generally
cultivate the ground, and the men are
all fiſhermen and canoemakers. Upon
the whole, Inever met any nation that
were ſo ſimple in their manners as theſe
people, or had ſolittle ornamentin their
houſes. Neither had they, as I ever
could learn, one word expreſſive of an
oath. The worſt word I ever heard
amongſt them when they were quarrel-
ling, was one that they had got from the
Engliſh, which was youraſcal.’ I never
ſaw any mode of worſhip among them;
but in this they were not worſe than
their European brethren or neighbours,
for I am ſorry to ſay that there was not
one white perſon in our dwelling, nor

anywhere elſe, that I ſaw, in different
places I was at on the ſhore, that was
better or more pious than thoſe unen-
lightened indians; but they either
worked or ſlept on Sundays: and, to
my ſorrow, working was too much Sun-
day’s employment with ourſelves; ſo
much ſo, that in ſome length of time
we really did not know one day from
another. This mode of living laid the
foundation of my decamping at laſt.
The natives are well made and warlike;
and they particularly boaſt of having
never been conquered by the Spaniards.
They are great drinkers of ſtrong
liquors when they can get them. We
uſed to diſtil rum from pine apples,
which were very plentiful here; and
then we could not get them away from
our place. Yet they ſeemed to be ſin-
gular, in point of honeſty, above any
other nation I was ever amongſt. The

country being hot, we lived under an
open ſhed, where we had all kinds of
goods, without a door or a lock to any
one article; yet we ſleptin ſafety, and
never loſt any thing, or were diſturbed.
This ſurpriſed us a good deal; and the
Dočtor, myſelf, and others, uſed to ſay if
we were to lie in thatmanner in Europe
we ſhould have our throats cut the firſt
night. The Indian governor goes once
in a certain time all about the province
or diſtrićt, and has a number of men
with him as attendants and aſſiſtants. He
ſettles all the differences among the
people, like the judge here, and is
treated with very great reſpect. He took
care to give us timely notice before he
came to our habitation, by ſending his
ſtick as a token, for rum, ſugar, and
gunpowder, which we did not re-
fuſe ſending; and at the ſame time we
made the utmoſt preparation to receive
2 his

his honour and his train. When he
came with his tribe, and all our neigh-
bouring chieftians, we expected to find
him a grave reverend judge, ſolid and
ſagacious; but inſtead of that, before
he and his gang came in fight, we
heard them very clamorous; and they
even had plundered ſome of our good
neighbouring Indians, having intoxi-
cated themſelves withour liquor. When
they arrived we did not know what to
make of our new gueſts, and would
gladly have diſpenſed with the honour
of their company. However, having
no alternative, we feaſted them plen-
tifully all the day till the evening; when
the governor, getting quite drunk,
grew very unruly, and ſtruck one of
our moſt friendly chiefs, who was our
neareſt neighbour, and alſo took his
gold-laced hat from him. At this a
great commotion taken place; and the

Doğor interfered to make peace, as
we could all underſtand one another,
but to no purpoſe; and at laſt they
became ſo outrageous that the Doctor,
fearing he might get into trouble, left
the houſe, and made the beſt of his
way to the neareſt wood, leaving me to
do as well as I could among them. I
was ſo enraged with the Governor, that
I could have wiſhed to have ſeen him
tied faſt to a tree and flogged for his
behaviour; but I had not people enough
to cope with his party. I therefore
thought of a ſtratagem to appeaſe the
riot. Recollecting a paſſage I had read
in the life of Columbus, when he was
amongſt the Indians in Mexico or Peru,
where on ſome occaſion, he frightened
them, by telling them of certain events
in the heavens, I had recourſe to the
ſame expedient; and it ſucceeded be-
yond my moſt ſanguine expectations.
When

<page 512>

[ 195 J
when I had formed my determination,
I went in the midſt of them; and, tak-
ing hold of the Governor, I pointed
up to the heavens. I menaced him
and the reſt: I told them God lived
there, and that he was angry with
them, and they muſt not quarrel ſo;
that they were all brothers, and if
they did not leave off, and go away
quietly, I would take the book (point-
ing to the Bible) read, and tell God to
make them dead. This operated on
them like magic.—The clamour im–
mediately ceaſed, and I gave them
ſome rum and a few other things; after
which they went away peaceably; and
the Governor afterwards gave our
neighbour, who was called Captain
Plaſmyah, his hat again. When the
Doctor returned, he was exceedingly
glad at my ſucceſs in thus getting rid
of our troubleſome gueſts. The Muſ-

quito people within our vicinity, out of
reſpect to the Doctor, myſelf, and his
people, made entertainments of the
grand kind, called in their tongue
tourrie ordyckºoſ. The Engliſh of this
expreſſionis, a feaſt of drinking about,
of which it ſeems a corruption of lan-
guage. The drink conſiſted of pine
apples roaſted, and caſades chewed or
beaten in mortars; which, after lying
ſome time, ferments, and becomes ſo
ſtrong as to intoxicate, when drank in
any quantity. We had timely notice
given to us of the entertainment. A
white family, whithin five miles of us,
told us how the drink was made, and I
and two others went before the time to
the village, where the mirth was ap-
pointed to be held, and there we ſaw
the whole art of making the drink, and
alſo the kind of animals that were to
be eaten there. I cannot ſay the fight
of

<page 514>

| 197
of either the drink or the meat were
enticing to me. They had ſome thou-
ſands of pine apples roaſting, which
they ſqueezed dirt and all, into a canoe
they had there for the purpoſe. The
caſade drink was in beef barrels, and
other veſſels, and looked exactly like
hog-waſh. Men, women, and children,
were thus employed in roaſting the
pine apples, and ſqueezing them with
their hands. For food they had many
land torpins or tortoiſes, ſome dried
turtle, and three large alligators alive,
and tied laſt to the trees. I aſked the
people what they were going to do with
theſe alligators; and I was told they
were to be eaten. I was much ſurpriſ–
ed at this, and went home, not a little
diſguſted at the preparations. When
the day of the feaſt was come, we took
ſome rum with us, and went to the ap-
pointed place, where we found a great
- - K 3 aſſem-

<page 515>

[ 198 ||
aſſemblage of theſe people, who re-
ceived us very kindly. The mirth had
begun before we came; and they were
dancing with muſic: and the muſical
inſtruments were nearly the ſame as
thoſe of any other ſable people; but, as
I thought much leſs melodious than
any other nation I ever knew. They
had many curious geſtures in dancing,
and a variety of motions and poſtures of
their bodies, which to me were in no
wiſe attracting. The males danced by
themſelves, and the females alſo by
themſelves, as with us. The Doctor
ſhewed his people the example, by im-
mediately joining the women’s party,
though not by their choice. On per-
ceiving the women diſguſted, he joined
the males. At night there were great
illuminations, by ſetting fire to many
pine trees, while the dryckbot went
round merrily by calabaſhes orgourds:
but the liquor might more juſtly be

ealled eating than drinking. One Ow-
den, the oldeſt father in the vicinity,
was dreſſed in a ſtrange and terrifying
form. Around his body were ſkins
adorned with different kinds of feathers,
and he had on his head a very large and
high head-piece, in the form of a gre-
madier's cap, with prickles like a por-
eupine: and he made a certain noiſe
which reſembled the cry of an alligator.
Our people ſkipped amongſt them out
of complaiſance, though ſome could not
drink of their tourrie; but our rum met
with cuſtomers enough, and was ſoon
gone. The alligators were killed and
ſome of them roaſted. Their manner
of roaſting is by digging a hole in the
earth, and filling it with wood, which
they burn to coal, and then they lay
ſticks acroſs, on which they ſet the meat-
1 had a raw piece of the alligator in my
band: it was very rich: I thought it
looked like freſh ſalmon, and it had a

moſt fragrant ſmell, but I could not
eat any of it. This merry-making at
laſt ended without the leaſt diſcord in
any perſon in the company, although it
was made up of different nations and
complexions. -
The rainy ſeaſon came on here
about the latter end of May, which
continued till Auguſt very heavily;
ſo that the rivers were overflow-
ed, and our proviſions then in the
ground were waſhed away. I thought
this was in ſome meaſure a judgment
upon us for working on Sundays, and it
hurt my mind very much. I often
wiſhed to leave this place and ſail for
Europe; for our mode of procedure
and living in this heatheniſh form was
very irkſome to me. The word of God
faith, What does it avail a man if he
“gain the whole world, and loſe his
own ſoul?” This was much and hea-
vily impreſſed on my mind; and though
I

<page 518>

I 2p ||
I did not know how to ſpeak to the
Doctor for my diſcharge, it was diſ-
agreeable for me to ſtay any longer.
But about the middle of June I took
courage enough to aſk him for it. He
was very unwilling at firſt to grant
my requeſt; but I gave him ſo many
reaſons for it, that at laſt he conſented
to my going, and gave me the follow-
ing certificate of my behaviour:
* The bearer, Guſtavus Vaſſa, has
ſerved me ſeveral years with ſtrict
* honeſty, ſobriety, and fidelity. I can,
therefore with juſtice recommend him
* for theſe qualifications; and indeed in
every reſpect I conſider him as an ex-
cellent ſervant. I do hereby certify
that he always behaved well, and that
he is perfectly truſt-worthy. -

Though I was much attached to the
Doctor, I was happy when he conſented.
I got everything ready for my depart-
ure, and hired ſome Indians, with a
large canoe, to carry me off. All my
poor countrymen, the ſlaves, when they
heard of my leaving them, were very
ſorry, as I had always treated them with
care and affection, and did everything
I could to comfort the poor creatures,
and rendertheir condition eaſy. Hav-
ing taken leave of my old friends and
companions, on the 18th of June, ac-
companied by the Doctor, I left that
ſpot of the world, and went ſouthward
above twenty miles along the river-
There I found a ſloop, the captain of
which told me he was going to Jamaica.
Having agreed for my paſſage with
him and one of the owners, who was
alſo on board, named Hughes, the
Doctor and I parted, not without ſhed-
- ding

<page 520>
[ 203 ||
ding tears on both ſides. The veſić
then ſailed along the river till night,
when ſhe ſtopped in a lagoon within the
ſame river. During the nightaſchooner
belonging to the ſame owners camein,
and, as ſhe was in want of hands,
Hughes, the owner of the ſloop aſked
me to go in the ſchooner as a ſailor,
and ſaid he would give me wages. I
thanked him; but I ſaid I wanted to
go to Jamaica. He then immediately
changed histone, and ſwore, and abuſed
me very much, and aſked how I came
to be freed. I told him, and ſaid that
I came into that vicinity with Dr.
Irving; whom he had ſeen that day.
This account was of nouſe; he ſtillſwore
exceedingly at me, and curſed the maſ-
ter for a fool that ſold me my freedom,
and the doctor for another in letting
me go from him. Then he deſired me
to go in the ſchooner, or elſe I ſhould
- K 6 not







<page 521>

| 204
not go out of the ſloop as a free-man.
I ſaid this was very hard, and begged
to be put on ſhore again; but he ſwore
that I ſhould not. I ſaid I had been
twice amongſt the Turks, yet had never
ſeen any ſuch uſage with them, and
much leſs could I have expected any
thing of this kind among the Chriſ-
tians. This incenſed him exceedingly;
and, with a volley of oaths and impre-
cations, he replied, ‘Chriſtians' damn
“you, you are one of St. Paul's men;
* but by G–, except you have St.
* Paul’s or St. Peter's faith, and walk
* upon the water to the ſhore, you ſhall
not go out of the veſſel; which I now
learnt was going amongſt the Spaniards
towards Carthagena, where he ſwore he
would ſell me. I ſimply aſked him
what right he had to ſell me? but,
without another word, he made ſome
of his people tie ropes round each of

<page 522>

I do; -
my ancies, and alſo to each wriſt, and
another rope round my body, and
hoiſted me up without letting my feet
touch or reſt upon anything. Thus I
hung, without any crime committed,
and without judge or jury; merely be—
cauſe I was a free man, and could not
by the law get any redreſs from a white
perſon in thoſe parts of the world. I
was in great pain from my ſituation,
and cried and begged very hard for
ſome mercy; but all in vain. My
tyrant, in a great rage brought a muſ-
quet out of the cabin and loaded it
before me and the crew, and ſwore that
he would ſhoot me if I cried any more.
I had now no alternative; I therefore
remained ſilent, ſeeing not one white
man on board who ſaid a word on
my behalf. I hung in that manner
from between ten and eleven o’clock
at night till about one in the morning;
when,

<page 523>

[ 206 J
when, finding my cruel abuſer faſt
aſleep, I begged ſome of his ſlaves to
ſlack the rope that was round my body,
that my feet might reſt on ſomething.
This they did at the riſk of being
cruelly uſed by their maſter, who beat
ſome of them ſeverely at firſt for not
tying me when he commanded them.
Whilſt I remained in this condition, till
between five and ſix o'clock next
morning, I truft I prayed to God to
forgive this blaſphemer, who cared not
what he did, but when he got up out of
his ſleep in the morning was of the very
ſame temper and diſpoſition as when
he left meat night. When they got
up the anchor, and the veſſel was getting
under way, I once more cried and
begged to be releaſed; and now, being
fortunately in the way of their hoiſting
the ſails, they releaſed me. When I
was let down, I ſpoke to one Mr. Cox,
a Cat-

<page 524>

* [ 207
a carpenter, whom I knew on board,
on the impropriety of this conduct.
He alſo knew the doctor, and the good
opinion he ever had of me. This man
then went to the captain, and told him
not to carry me away in that manner?
that I was the doctor's ſteward, who
regarded me very highly, and would
reſent this uſage when he ſhould come
to know it. On which he deſired a
young man to put me aſhore in a ſmall
canoe I brought with me. This ſound
gladdened my heart, and I got haſtily
into the canoe and ſet off, whilſt my
tyrant was down in the cabin; but he
ſoon ſpied me out, when I was not
above thirty or forty yards from the
veſſel, and running upon the deck with
a loaded muſket in his hand, he pre-
ſented it at me, and ſwore heavily and
dreadfully, that he would ſhoot me
that inſtant, if I did not comeback on
board,

<page 525>

board. As I knew the wretch would
have done as he ſaid, without heſitation,
I put back to the veſſel again; but, as
the good Lord would have it, juſt as
I was alongſide he was abuſing the
captain for letting me go from the veſ.
ſel; which the captain returned, and
both of them ſoon got into a very great
heat. The young man that was with
me now got out of the canoe; the veſ:
ſel was ſailing on faſt with a ſmooth ſea:
and I then thought it was neck or no-
thing, ſo at that inſtant I ſet off again,
for my life, in the canoe, towards
the ſhore; and fortunately the confuſion
was ſo great amongſt them on board,
that I got out of the reach of the muſ-
ket ſhot unnoticed, while the veſſel
failed on with a fair wind a different
way; ſo that they could not overtake
me without tacking; but even before
that could be done I ſhould have been
on

<page 526>

[ 209 |
on ſhore, which I ſoon reached, with
many thanks to God for this unex-
pected deliverance. I then went and
told the other owner, who lived near
that ſhore (with whom I had agreed for
my paſſage) of the uſage I had met
with. He was very much aſtoniſhed
and appeared very ſorry for it. After
treating me with kindneſs, he gave me
ſome refreſhment, and three heads of
roaſted Indian corn, for a voyage of
about eighteen miles ſouth, to look for
another veſſel. He then directed me
to an Indian chief of a diſtrict, who
was alſo the Muſquito admiral, and had
once been at our dwelling; after which
H ſet off with the canoe acroſs a large
lagoon alone (for I could not get any
one to aſſiſt me), though I was much
jaded, and had pains in my bowels, by
means of the rope I had hung by the
night before. I was therefore at differ-
- ent


<page 527>

*
216
ent times unable to manage the canoe,
for the paddling was very laborious.
However, a little before dark i got to
my defined place, where ſome of the
Indians knew me, and received me
kindly. I aſked for the admiral; and
they conducted me to his dwelling.
He was glad to ſee me, and refreſhed
me with fuch things as the place
afforded; and I had a hammock to
ſleep in. They acted towardsmemore
like Chriſtians than thoſe whites I was
amongſt the laſt night, though they
had been baptiſed. Itold the admiral
I wanted to go to the next port to get
a veſſel to carry me to Jamaica; and
requeſted him to ſend the canoe back
which I then had, for which I was to
pay him. He agreed with me, and
ſent five able Indians with a large canoe
to carry my things to my intended
place, about fifty miles; and we ſet º

the next morning. When we got out
of the lagoon and went along ſhore,
the ſea was ſo high that the canoe was
oftentimes very near being filled with
water. We were obliged to go aſhore
and drag acroſs different necks of land;
we were alſo two nights in the ſwamps,
which ſwarmed with muſquito flics,
and they proved troubleſome to us.
This tireſome journey of land and wa-
ter ended, however, on the third day,
to my greatjoy; and I got on board of
a ſloop commanded by one Captain
Jenning. She was then partly loaded,
and he told me he was expecting daily
to ſail for Jamaica; and having agreed
with me to work my paſſage, I went
to work accordingly. I was not many
days on board before we ſailed; but to
my ſorrow and diſappointment, though
uſed to ſuch tricks, we went to the
ſouthward along the Muſquito ſhore,
lſh-

<page 529>
[ 212 |
inſtead of ſteering for Jamaica. I was
compelled to aſſiſt in cutting a great
deal of mahogany wood on the ſhore as
we coaſted along it, and load the veſſel
with it, before ſhe ſailed. This fretted
me much; but, as I did not know how
to help myſelf among theſe deceivers, I
thought patience was the only remedy
I had left, and even that was forced.
There was much hard work and little
victuals on board, except by good luck -
we happened to catch turtles. On this
coaſt there was alſo a particular kind of
fiſh called manatee, which is moſt ex-
cellent eating, and the fleſh is more
like beef than fiſh; the ſcales are as
large as a ſhilling, and the ſkin thick:
than Lever ſaw that of any other fiſh.
within the brackiſhwaters along ſhore
there were likewiſe vaſthumbersofalli-
gators, which made the fiſh ſcarce. I
was on board this ſloop ſixteen days,
- during

D 213 J
during which, in our coaſting, we came
to another place, where there was a
ſmaller ſloop called the Indian Queen,
commanded by one John Baker. He
alſo was an Engliſhman, and had been
alongtime along the ſhore trading for
turtle ſhells and ſilver, and had got a
good quantity of each on board. He
wanted ſome hands very much; and, un-
derſtanding Iwas a freeman, and wanted
to go to Jamaica, he told me if he could
get one or two, that he would ſail im–
- mediately for that Iſland : he alſo pre-
tended to ſhew me ſome marks of at-
tention and reſpect, and promiſed to
give me forty-five hillings ſterling a
a month if I would go with him. I
thought this much better than cutting
Wood for nothing. I therefore told the
other captain that I wanted to go to Ja-
maica in the other veſſel; but he would
hotliſtentome; and, ſeeingmereſolved

toge in a day or two, he got the veſſel tº
fail, intending to carry meaway againſt
my will. This treatment mortified me
extremely. I immediately, according
to an agreement I had made with the
captain of the Indian Queen, called for
her boat, which was lying near us,
and it came alongſide; and, by the
means of a north-pole ſhipmate which
I met with in the ſloop I was in, I got
mythings into the boat, and went on
board of the Indian Queen, July the
roth. A few days after I was there,
we got all things ready and ſailed; but
again, to my great mortification, this
veſſel ſtill went to the ſouth, nearly as
far as Carthagena, trading along the
coaſt, inſtead of going to Jamaica, as
the captain had promiſed me: and,
what was worſt of all, he was a very
crueland bloody-minded man, and was
a horrid blaſphemer. Among *:

he had a white pilot, one Stoker,
whom he beat often as ſeverely as he
did ſomenegroes he had on board. One
night in particular, after he had beaten
this man moſt cruelly, he put him into
the boat, and made two negroes row
him to a deſolate key, or ſmall iſland;
and he loaded two piſtols, and ſwore
bitterly that he would ſhoot thenegroes
if they brought Stoker on board again.
There was not the leaſt doubt but that
he would do as he ſaid, and the two
poor fellows were obliged to obey the
cruel mandate; but, when the captain
was aſleep, the two negroes took a
blanket and carried it to the unfortu-
nate Stoker, which I believe was the
means of ſaving his life from the an-
noyance of inſects. A great deal of
entreaty was uſed with the captain the
next day, before he would conſent to
let Stoker come on board; and when
2 the

<page 533>

[ 216 |
the poor man was brought on board he
was very ill, from his ſituation during
the night, and he remained ſo till he
was drowned a little time after. As we
failed ſouthward we came to many
uninhabited iſlands, which were over-
grown with fine large cocoanuts. As
I was very much in want of proviſions,
I brought a boat load of them on
board, which laſted me and others for
ſeveral weeks, and afforded us many a
delicious repaſtin our ſcarcity. One
day, before this, I could not help ob-
ſerving the providential hand of God,
that ever ſupplies all our wants, though
in the ways and manner we know not.
I had been a whole day without food,
and made ſignals for boats to come off,
but in vain. Itherefore earneſtly prayed
to God for relief in my need; and at
the cloſe of the evening I went off the
deck. Juſt as 1 laid down I heard a
- noiſe

<page 534>

| 217
noiſe on the deck; and, not knowing
what it meant, I went directly on the
deck again, when what ſhould I ſee but
a fine large fiſh about ſeven or eight
pounds, which had jumped aboard! I
took it, and admired, with thanks, the
good hand of God; and, what I con-
fidered as not leſs extraordinary, the
captain, who was very avaricious, did
not attempt to take it from me, there
being only him and I on board; for
the reſt were all gone aſhore trading.
Sometimes the people did not come
off for ſome days: this uſed to fret the
captain, and then he would vent his
fury on me by beating me, or making
me feelin other cruel ways. One day
eſpecially, in his wild, wicked, and mad
career, after ſtriking me ſeveral times
with different things, and once acroſs
my mouth, even with a red burning
ſtick out of the fire, he got a barrel of
Vol. II. L gun-

<page 535>

[ 218
gunpowder on the deck, and ſwore
that he would blow up the veſſel. I
was then at my wit’s end, and carneſtly
prayed to God to direct me. The
head was out of the barrel; and the
captain took a lighted ſtick out of the
fire to blow himſelf and me up, be-
cauſe there was a veſſel then in fight
coming in, which he ſuppoſed was a
Spaniard, and he was afraid of falling
into their hands. Seeing this I got
an axe, unnoticed by him, and placed
myſelf between him and the powder,
having reſolved in myſelf as ſoon as he
attempted to put the fire in the barrel
to chop him down that inſtant. I was
more than an hour in this ſituation;
during which he ſtruck me often, ſtill
keeping the fire in his hand for this
wicked purpoſe. I really ſhould have
thought myſelf juſtifiable in any other
part of the world if I had killed him,
and

<page 536>

and prayed to God, who gave me a
mind which reſted ſolely on himſelf.
I prayed for reſignation, that his will
might be done: and the following two
portions of his holy word, which oc-
cured to my mind, buoyed up my hope,
and kept me from taking the life of
this wicked man. “He hath deter-
“mined the times before appointed,
and ſet bounds to our habitations,”
Acts xvii. 26. And, “Who is there
‘ among you that feareth the Lord, that
* obeyeth the voice of his ſervant, that
“walketh in darkneſs and hath no
“light? let him truſt in the name of
‘the Lord, and ſtay upon his God,'
Iſaiah 1. 20. And thus by the grace
of God I was enabled to do. I found
him a preſent help in the time of need,
and the captain's fury began to ſub-
fide as the night approached; but I
found,
L 2 * That



<page 537>

| 220 J
“ That he who cannot ſtem his anger's tide
* Doth a wild horſe without a bridle ride.”
The next morning we diſcovered that
the veſſel which had cauſed ſuch aſury
in the captain was an Engliſh ſloop.
They ſoon came to an anchor where we
were, and, to my no ſmall ſurpriſe, I
learned that Doctor Irving was onboard
of her on his way from the Muſquito
ſhore to Jamaica. I was for going
immediately to ſee this old maſter and
friend, but the captain would not ſuffer
me to leave the veſſel. I then informed
the Doctor, by letter, how I was treated,
and begged that he would take me out of
the ſloop; but he informed me that it
was not in his power, as he was a paſ-
ſenger himſelf; but he ſent me ſome
rum and ſugar for my own uſe. I now
learned that after I had left the eſtate
which I managed for this gentleman
On

<page 538>

[ 221 J
on the Muſquito ſhore, during which
the ſlaves were well fed and comfort-
able, a white overſeer had ſupplied my
place: this man through inhumanity
and ill-judged avarice, beat and cut
the poor ſlaves moſt unmercifully; and
the conſequence was, that every one
got into a large Puriogua canoe, and
endeavoured to eſcape; but not know-
ing where to go, or how to manage
the canoe, they were all drowned ; in
conſequence of which the Doctor's plan-
tation was left uncultivated, and he was
now returning to Jamaica to purchaſe
more ſlaves, and ſtock it again.
On the 14th of October, the Indian
Queen arrived at Kingſton in Jamaica.
When we were unloaded I demanded
my wages, which amounted to eight
pounds five ſhillings ſterling; but
Captain Baker refuſed to give me one
farthing, although it was the hardeſt-
L 3 earned


<page 539>

[ 222 J
earned money I ever worked for in my
life. I found out Doctor Irving upon
this, and acquainted him of the cap-
tain's knavery. He did all he could
to help me to get my money; and we
went to every magiſtrate in Kingſton
(and there were nine) but they all re-
fuſed to do any thing for me, and ſaid
my oath could not be admitted againſt
a white man. Nor was this all, for
Baker threatened that he would beat
me ſeverely if he could catch me for
attempting to demand my money; and
this he would have done, but that I got,
by means of Doctor Irving, under the
protection of Captain Douglas, of the
Squirrel man of war. I thought this
exceeding hard uſage; though indeed
I found it to be too much the practice
there to pay free negro men for their
labour in this manner.
One day I went with a free negroe
taylor, named Joe Diamond, to one
Mr.

<page 540>

[ 223 I
Mr. Cochran, who was indebted to
him ſome trifling ſum ; and the man,
not being able to get his money, be-
gan to murmur. The other immedi-
ately took a horſe-whip to pay him with
it, but, by the help of a good pair of
heels, the taylor got off. Such oppreſ-
ſions as theſe made me ſeek for a
veſſel to get off the iſland as faſt as I
could: and by the mercy of God, I
found a ſhip in November bound for
England, when I embarked with a con-
voy, after having taken a laſt farewell
of Doctor Irving. When I left Jamaica
he was employed in refining ſugars;
and ſome months after my arrival in
England I learned, with much ſorrow,
that this my amiable friend was dead,
owing to his having eaten ſome poi-
ſoned fiſh.
We had many very heavy gales of
wind in our paſſage; in the courſe of

which no material incident occurred,
except that an American privateer,
falling in with the fleet, was captured
and ſet fire to by his Majeſty's ſhip
the Squirrel.
On January the ſeventh, 1777, we
arrived at Plymouth. I was happy
once more to tread upon Engliſh
ground; and, after paſſing ſome little
time at Plymouth and Exeter, among
ſome pious friends, whom I was hap-
py to ſee, I went to London with a
heart replete with thanks to God for
paſt mercies.

I had ſuffered ſo many impoſitions
in my commercial tranſactions in dif-

heartily diſguſted with the ſeafaring
life, and was determined not to re-
turn to it, at leaſt for ſome time. I
therefore once more engaged inſervice
ſhortly after my return, and continued
for the moſt part in this ſituation until
1784.
Soon after my arrival in London, I
ſaw a remarkable circumſtance relative
to Africancomplexion, which I thought
ſo extraordinary, that I beg leave juſt
to mention it: A white negro woman,
that I had formerly ſeen in London
and other parts, had married a white
man, by whom ſhe had three boys,
and they were everyone mullattoes, and
yet they had fine light hair. In 1779,

had been a conſiderable time on the
coaſt of Africa. In the time of my
ſervice, I uſed to aſk frequently other
ſervants to join me in family prayer;
but this only excited their mockery.
However, the Governor, underſtanding
that I was of a religious turn, wiſhed
to know what religion I was of; I told
him I was a proteſtant of the church
of England, agreeable to the thirty-
nine articles of that church ; and that
whomſoever I found to preach accord-
ing to thatdoºtrine, thoſe I would hear.
A few days after this, we had ſome more
diſcourſe on the ſame ſubject; when he
ſaid he would, if I choſe, as he thought
I might be of ſervice in converting my
countrymen to the Goſpel faith, get
me ſent out as miſſionary to Africa.

how I had been ſerved on a like occa-

prince; and ſaid I ſuppoſed they would
ſerve me worſe than Alexander the
copperſmith did St. Paul, if I ſhould
attempt to go amongſt them in Africa.
He told me not to fear, for he would
apply to the Biſhop of London to get
me ordained. On theſe terms Icon-
ſented to the Governor’s propoſal to
go to Africa in hope of doing good, if
poſſible, amongſt my countrymen; ſo,
in order to have me ſent out properly,

The MEMORIAL of Gustavus V.Assa
SHEwerH,
THAT your memorialiſt
is a native of Africa, and has a know-
ledge of the manners and cuſtoms of
the inhabitants of that country.
That your memorialiſt has reſided
in different parts of Europe for twenty-
two years laſt paſt, and embraced the
Chriſtian faith in the year 1759.
That your memorialiſt is deſirous of
returning to Africa as a miſſionary, if
encouraged by your Lordſhip, in hopes
of being able to prevail upon his
Countrymen to become Chriſtians; and
your memorialiſt is the more induced
to undertake the ſame, from the ſucceſs
that has attended the like undertakings
when encouraged by the Portugeuſe
through

[ 23o
through their different ſettlements on:
the coaſt of Africa, and alſo by the
Dutch: both governments encourag-
ing the blacks, who, by their educa-
tion are qualified to undertake the
ſame, and are found more proper than
European clergymen, unacquainted
with the language and cuſtoms of the
country.
Your memorialiſt’s only motive for
ſoliciting the office of a miſſionary is,
that he may be a means, under God,
of reforming his countrymen and per-
ſuading them to embrace the Chriſtian
religion. Therefore your memorialiſt
humbly prays your Lordſhip's encou-
ragement and ſupport in the under-
taking.

My Lord,
I HAve reſided near
ſeven years on the coaſt of Africa, for
moſt part of the time as commanding
officer. From the knowledge I have
of the country and its inhabitants, I
am inclined to think that the within
plan will be attended with great ſuc-
ceſs, if countenanced by your Lord-
ſhip. I beg leave further to repreſent
to your Lordſhip, that the like attempts,
when cncouraged by other govern-
ments, have met with uncommon ſuc-
ceſs; and at this very time I know a
very reſpectable character a black prieſt
at Cape Coaſt Caſtle. I know the
within named Guſtavus Vaſſa, and be-
lieve him a moral good man.
I have the honour to be,
My Lord,
Your Lordſhip's
Humble and obedient ſervant,

This letter was alſo accompanied by
the following from Doctor Wallace,
who had reſided in Africa for many
years, and whoſe ſentiments on the

March 13, 1779.
My Loºp,
I have reſided near five years
on Senegambia on the coaſt of Africa,
and have had the honour of filling very
conſiderable employments in that pro-
vince. I do approve of the within
plan, and think the undertaking very
laudableand proper, and that it deſerves
your Lordſhip's protection and encou-
ragement, in which caſe it muſt be at-
tended with the intended ſucceſs.
I am, my Lord,
Your Lordſhip's
Humble and obedient ſervant,

With theſe letters, I waited on the
Biſhop by the Governor's deſire, and
preſented them to his Lordſhip. He
received me with much condeſcenſion
and politeneſs; but, from ſome certain
ſcruples of delicacy, and ſaying the
Biſhops were not of opinion of ſend-
ing a new miſſionary to Africa, he de-
clined to ordain me.
- My ſole motive for thus dwelling on
this tranſaction, or inſerting theſe pa-
pers, is the opinion which gentlemen
of ſenſe and education, who are ac-
quainted with Africa, entertain of the
probability of converting the inhabit-
ants of it to the faith of Jeſus Chriſt,
if the attempt were countenanced by
the legiſlature.
Shortly after this I left the Governor,
and ſerved a nobleman in the Dorſet-
ſhire militia, whith whom I was en-
camped at Coxheath for ſome times
but

<page 551>

[ 234
but the operations there were too mi-
nute and unintereſting to make a de-
tail of.
In the year 1783, I viſited eight
counties in Wales, from motives of
curioſity. While I was in that part of
the country I was led to go down into
a coal-pit in Shropſhire, but my curi-
ofity nearly coſt me my life; for while
I was in the pit the coals fell in, and
buried one poor man, who was not far
from me: upon this I got out as faſt
as I could, thinking the ſurface of the
earth the ſafeſt part of it.
In the ſpring of 1784, I thought of
viſiting old ocean again. In conſe-
quenee of this I embarked as ſteward
on board a fine new ſhip called the
London, commanded by Martin Hop-
kin, and ſailed for New-York. I ad-
mired this city very much ; it is large
and well-built, and abounds with pro-
viſions

<page 552>


f 235
viſions of all kinds. While we lay
here a circumſtance happened which I
thought extremely ſingular:-One day
a malefactor was to be executed on a
gallows; but with a condition that if
any woman, having nothing on but her
ſhift, married the man under the gal-
lows, his life was to be ſaved. This
extraordinary privilege was claimed;
a woman preſented herſelf; and the
marriage ceremony was performed.
Our ſhip having got laden were turn-
ed to London in January 1785. When
ſhe was ready again for another voyage,
the captain being an agreeable man,
I ſailed with him from hence in the
ſpring, March 1785, for Philadelphia.
On the 5th of April, we took our de-
parture from the land’s-end, with a
pleaſant gale; and about nine o'clock
that night the moon ſhone bright, and
the ſea was ſmooth, while our ſhip
Wº:

<page 553>

[ 236 |
was going free by the wind, at the rate
of about four or five miles an hour—
At this time another ſhip was going
nearly as faſt as we on the oppoſite
point, meeting us right in the teeth,
yet none on board obſerved either ſhip
until we ſtruck each other forcibly
head and head, to the aſtoniſhment
and conſternation of both crews. She
did us much damage, but I believe
we did her more; for when we paſſed
by each other,which we did very quick-
ly, they called to us to bring to, and
hoiſt out our boat, but we had enough
to do to mind ourſelves; and in about
eight minutes we ſaw no more of her.
We refitted as well as we could the
next day, and proceeded on our voyage,
and in May arrived at Philadelphia.
I was very glad to ſee this favorite
old town once more; and my pleaſure
was much increaſed in ſeeing the wor-

thy quakers freeing and eaſing the bur-
thens of many of my oppreſſed African
brethren. It rejoiced my heart when
one of theſe friendly people took me to
ſee a free-ſchool they had erected for
every denomination of black people,
whoſe minds are cultivated here, and
forwarded to virtue; and thus they are
made uſeful members of the commu-
nity. Does not the ſucceſs of this
practice ſay loudly to the planters, in
the language of ſcripture—“Go ye

In October 1785, I was accompanied
by ſome of the Africans, and preſented
this addreſs of thanks to the gentlemen
called Friends or Quakers, in Grace-
church-Court, Lombard-Street:

labour, and kind interpoſition, towards
breaking the yoke of ſlavery, and to
adminiſter a little comfort and caſe to

burthened negroes.

of the oppreſſors; and if ſo, ſure we are

every true act of virtue, and regards the
prayers of the oppreſſed, will give to
you and yours thoſe bleſſings which it
is not in our power to expreſs or con-
ceive, but which we as a part of thoſe
captivated, oppreſſed, and aftlicted peo-
ple, moſt earneſtly wiſh and pray for.
Theſe gentlemen received us very
kindly, with a promiſe to exert them-
ſelves on behalf of the oppreſſed Afri-
cans, and we parted.
While in town, I chanced once to
be invited to a quaker's wedding. The
ſimple and yet expreſſive mode uſed at
their ſolemnizations is worthy of note.
The following is the true form of it:
After the company have met, they
have ſeaſonable exhortations by ſeveral
of the members; the bride and bride-
groom ſtand up, and, taking cach other

by the hand in a ſolemn manner, the
man audibly declares to this purpºſe.
“Friends, in the fear of the Lord,
and in the preſence of this aſſembly,
whom I deſire to be my witneſſes, I
take this my friend, M. N. to be my
wife; promiſing, through divine aſſiſt-
ance, to be unto her a loving and
faithful huſband till death ſeparateus.”
and the woman makes the like decla-
ration. Then the two firſt ſign their
names to the record, and as many more
witneſſes as have a mind. I had the
honour to ſubſcribe mine to a regiſ-
ter in Gracechurch-Court, Lombard-
Street.—My hand is ever free—if any
female Debonair wiſhes to obtain it,
this mode I recommend. -
We returned to London in Auguſt;
and our ſhip not going immediately to
fea, I ſhipped as a ſteward in an Ame-
rican ſhip called the Harmony, Captain

John Willet, and left London in March
1786, bound to Philadelphia. Eleven
days after ſailing, we carried our fore-
maſt away. We had a nine weeks paſ-
ſage, which cauſed our trip not to ſuc-
ceed well, the market for our goods
proving bad; and to make it worſe,
my commander began to play me the
like tricks as others too often practiſe
on free negroes in the Weſt Indies.
But I thank God I found many friends
here, who in ſome meaſure prevented
him. On my return to London in
Auguſt, I was very agreeably ſurpriſed
to find that the benevolence of govern-
ment had adopted the plan of ſome
philanthropic individuals to ſend the
Africans from hence to their native
quarter; and that ſome veſſels were
then engaged to carry them to Sierra
Leona; an act which redounded to the
honour of all concerned in its promo-

tion, and filled me with prayers and
much rejoicing. There was then in the
city, aſelect committee of gentlemen
for the black poor, to ſome of whom I
had the honour of being known; and,
as ſoon as they heard of my arrival, they
ſent for me to the committee. When
I came there, they informed me of the
intention of government; and as they
ſeemed to think me qualified to ſuper-
intend part of the undertaking, they
aſked me to go with the black poor to
Africa. I pointed out to them many
objections to my going; and particu-
larly I expreſſed ſome difficulties on the
account of the ſlave dealers, as I would
certainly oppoſe their traffic in the hu-
man ſpecies by every means in my
power. However theſe objections were
over-ruled by the gentlemenof the com-
mittee, who prevailed on me to conſent
to go; and recommended me to the ho-

among many which I could produce,
may ſerve as a ſpecimen. Government
had ordered to be provided all neceſ.
ſaries (ſlops, as they are called, includ-
ed) for 7so perſons; however, not
being able to muſter more than 426, 1
was ordered to ſend the ſuperfluous
flops, &c. to the king's ſtores at Portſ-
mouth; but, when I demanded them for
that purpoſe from the agent, it appeared
they had never been bought, though
paid for by government. But that was
not all, government were not the only
objects of peculation; theſe poor people
ſuffered infinitely more; their accom-
modations, were moſt wretched; many
of them wanted beds, and many more
cloathing and other neceſſaries. For
the truth of this, and much more, I do
not ſeek credit from my own aſſertion.
I appeal to the teſtimony of Capt.

Thompſon, of the Nautilus, who con-
voyed us, to whom I applied in Feb-
ruary 1787, for a remedy, when I had
remonſtrated to the agent in vain, and
even brought him to be a witneſs of the
injuſtice and oppreſſion I complained
of I appeal alſo to a letter written by
theſe wretched people, ſo early as the
beginning of the preceding January,
and publiſhed in the Morning Herald,
on the 4th of that month, ſigned by
twenty of their chiefs.
I could not ſilently ſuffer govern-
ment to be thus cheated, and my coun-
trymen plundered and oppreſſed, and
even left deſtitude of the neceſſaries for
almoſt their exiſtence. I therefore in-
formed the Commiſſioners of the Navy
of the agent's proceeding ; but my diſ-
miſſion was ſoon after procured, by
means of agentleman in the city, whom
the agent, conſcious of his peculation,

had deceived by letter, and who,
moreover, empowered the ſame agent
to receive on board, at the government
expence, a number of perſons as paſ-
ſengers, contrary to the orders I receiv-
rd. By this I ſuffered a conſiderable
loſs in my property: however, the com-
miſſioners were ſatisfied with my con-
duct, and wrote to Capt. Thompſon,
expreſſing their opprobation of it.
Thus provided, they proceeded on
their voyage; and at laſt, worn out by
treatment, perhaps not the moſt mild,
and waſted by ſickneſs, brought on by
want of medicine, cloaths, bedding,
&c. they reached Sirrea Leona juſt at
at the commencement of the rains.
At that ſeaſon of the year it is impoſ-
ſible to cultivate the lands; their pro-
viſions therefore were exhauſted before
they could derive any benefit from

agriculture; and it is not ſurpriſing

conſtitutions are very tender, and who
had been cooped up in ſhips from
Oćtoberto June, and accommodated in
the manner I have mentioned, ſhould
be ſo waſted by their confinement as
not long to ſurvive it.
Thus ended my part of the long-
talked of expedition to Sierra Leona;
an expedition which, however unfor-
tunate in the event, was humane and
politic in its deſign, nor was its failure
owing to government: everything was
done on their part; but there was evi-
dently ſufficient miſmanagement at-
tending the conduct and execution of
it to defeat its ſucceſs. -

my account of this tranſaction, had not

it is not proper here to inquire into or

ſhips would not proceed to ſo ſevere a
meaſure without ſome apparent good
cauſe; he therefore has every reaſon to
believe that his conduct has been
groſsly miſrepreſented to your Lord-
ſhips, and he is the more confirmed in
his opinion, becauſe, by oppoſing mea-
ſures of others concerned in the ſame
expedition, which tended to defeatyour
Lordſhips humane intentions, and to

number of enemies, whoſe miſrepre-
ſentations, he has too much reaſon to
believe, laid the foundation of his diſ-
miſſion. Unſupported by friends; and
unaided by the advantages of a liberal
education, he can only hope for redreſs
from the juſtice of his cauſe, in addition
to the mortification of having been re-
moved from his employment, and the
advantage which he reaſonably might
have expected to have derived there-
from. He has had the misfortune to
have ſunk a conſiderable part of his lit-
the property in fitting himſelf out, and
in other expences ariſing out of his ſitu-
ation, an account of which he here
annexes. Your memorialiſt will not
trouble your Lordſhips with a vindi-
cation of any part of his conduct, be-
cauſe he knows not of what crimes he
is accuſed; he, however, earneſtly en-
treats

an inquiry into his behaviour during
the time heasted in the public ſervice;
and, if it be found that his diſmiſſion

confident that in your Lordſhips juſ-

Your petitioner therefore humbly
prays that your Lordſhips will take his

As theinhuman traffic of ſlavery is to
be taken into the conſideration of the
Britiſh legiſlature, I doubt not, if a
ſyſtem of commerce was eſtabliſhed in
Africa, the demand for manufactures
will moſt rapidly augment, as the na-
tive inhabitants will inſenſibly adopt
the Britiſh faſhions, manners, cuſtoms,
&c. In proportion to the civilization,
ſo will be the conſumption of Britiſh
manufactures. -
The wear and tear of a continent,
nearly twice as large as Europe, and
rich in vegetable and mineral produc-
tions, is much eaſier conceived than
calculated.

ration, in point of conſumption, is
literally infinite. The ſuppoſition is
moſt obvious. It will be equally im-
menſe in Africa—The ſame cauſe, viz.
civilization, will ever have the ſame
effect.
It is trading upon ſafe grounds. A
commercial intercourſe with Africa
opens an inexhauſtible ſource of wealth
to the manufacturing intereſts of Great
Britain, and to all which the ſlave trade
is an objection.
If I am not miſinformed, the manu-
facturing intereſt is equal, if not ſupe-
rior, to the landed intereſt, as to the
value, for reaſons which will ſoon ap-
pear. The abolition of ſlavery, ſo
diabolical, will give a moſt rapid ex-
tenſion of manufactures, which is to-
tally and diametrically oppoſite to what
ſome intereſted people aſſert.

The manufactures of this country

ful returns; the hidden treaſures of cen—

mining, will have their full ſcope, pro-
portionably as they civilize. In a
word, it lays open an endleſs field of
commerce to the Britiſh manufactures
and merchant adventurer. The manu-
facturing intereſt and the general inte-
reſts are ſynonymous. The abolition of
ſlavery would be in reality an univerſal
good.

punity. I hope the ſlave trade will be
aboliſhed. I pray it may be an event
at hand. The great body of manufac-
turers, uniting in the cauſe, will con-
ſiderably facilitate and expedite it; and,
as I have already ſtated, it is moſt ſub-
ſtantially their intereſt and advantage,

thoſe perſons concerned in the manu-

ſcrews, iron muzzles, and coffins; cats,

from motives of intereſt as well as juſ-

imagination!
This I conceive to be a theory
founded upon facts, and therefore an
infallible one. If the blacks were per-
mitted to remain in their own country,
they would double themſelves every
fifteen years. In proportion to ſuch
increaſe will be the demand for manu-
factures. Cotton and indigo grow

I have only therefore to requeſt the
reader's indulgence and conclude. I
am far from the vanity of thinking there
is any merit in this narrative: I hope
cenſure will be ſuſpended, when it is
conſidered that it was written by one
who was as unwilling as unable to
adorn the plainneſs of truth by the
colouring of imagination. My life and
fortune have been extremely chequered,
and my adventures various. Even
thoſe I have related are conſiderably
abridged. If any incident in this little
work ſhould appear unintereſting and
trifling to moſt readers, I can only
ſay, as my excuſe for mentioning it,
that almoſt every event of my life made
an impreſſion on my mind, and in-
fluenced my conduct. I early accuſ-
tomed myſelf to look for the hand of
God in the minuteſt occurrence, and
to learn from it a leſſon of morality

and religion; and in this light, every
circumſtance I have related was to me
of importance. After all, what makes
any event important, unleſs by its ob-
ſervation we become better and wiſer,
and learn “to do juſtly, to love mercy,
* and to walk humbly before God?"
To thoſe who are poſſeſſed of this
ſpirit, there is ſcarcely any book or
incident ſo trifling that does not afford
ſome profit, while to others the experi-
ence of ages ſeems of no uſe; and even -
to pour out to them the treaſures of
wiſdom is throwing the jewels of in-
ſtruction away. -
