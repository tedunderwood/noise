1594 of Bonna Gercnifna Velazquez
by Juan Rodriguez de Silva, natives
of the fame illustrious city, and
both descended from antient and
honourable houses; he bore his mo-
ther's name Velazquez antecedent
to that of his family, according to
the ufage of Andalusia. The fa-

descent claims to derive from the
antient kings of Alba-Longa. The

'The parents of Velazquez, though
in very narrow circumstances, gave
their son a liberal education, and
tradition has preserved many cir-
cumstances of his early docility as
well as excellent disposition: But
when every paper, on which he wrote
his puerile tasks, exhibited (ketches
and drawings on the back and
those of such a stile as plainly in-
dicated a new and extraordinary
genius in its dawn, the good fense
of his parents did not hesitate upon
humouring the impulse and acror--
dingly put him under the instruc-
tion of Francisco de Hcrrera, com-
monly called Old Herrera, a rigid
master, but of consummate ability

in the art.-he taught. The. man-
ners and temper of Old Herrera
were however so unfupportable to
yOiuig Velazquez, that he left him
and entered himself in the academy
of Pacheco, a man of equal erudi-
tion and of an admirable nature:
Here his genius began to display
jtself in several sketches from na-
ture of peafants and ordinary peo-
ple in peculiar habits and occupa-
tions, as they struck his fancy in
the streets or pofadas of the city.
These first fallies of his imagination
give a striking representation of
the manners and characters of the
vulgar: They exhibit also a luxu-
riancy of still-lise, that he has in-
troduced in the scenery of his
pieces, in all which the costuma is

of wonderful nature and expression
with a- degree of science and preci-

is uncommon.
In subjects of this rustic fort
young Velazquez suffered his ima-
gination to disport itself in its first
fallies, replying to some, that
moved him to assume a higher-
stile of painting,. that the founda-
tion of his art must be strength;

of Guidoy Pamarancio* Cavtfllero,

which were brought to Seville out
of Italy, he altered his manner;
but the artist, upon whose model
he chiefly studied to form: himself.
at this time, was Luis Tristan .of
Toledo, a scholar of Dominica
Greco. Of Tristan he declared
himself an admirer and prosessed
imitator; his design, colouring and
vivacity of invention, were the
standard, to which he directed all
his studies. In portraits Dominica
Greco was his model, the air pf his
heads Velazquez held in the hjghest

[ • 1
estimation, and frequently ob-
served, "that what this master
'« did well was best of all good
*{ things, and what he did ill was
"bad in the extreme." 1
Whilst Velazquez was thus en-
gaged in the practice, he by !a&-
means neglected the theory of'his
art; he read every author of cre-
dit, that could form his judgment,
or enlarge his science, and some
he diligently studied, in particular
Alberto Durero for the symmetry of
the human figure Andres Bexalio
for anatomy: He read the trea-
tise of Daniel Barbaro on perspec-
tive; Vitrubio, Vinola and others
on architecture, and at the fame
time persected himself in the pro-
positionsof Euclid; elements, that

After five years thus studiously
employed in the academy he mar-
ried Donna Juana, the daughter of
his master Francisco Pacbeco, of a
family and name as noble as any in
Spain; this respectable artist in his
Treatise de la Pintura (Lib. i.
cap. 9), aster an elogium on the
merit of his pupil, declares, that
he

he was moved to bestow his daugh-
ter upon him from the many de-
monstrations he gave of a most vir-
tuous and liberal disposition, and
the high expectation he hid formed
of his talents after an experience of
five years, which he had spent in
superintending his education'; and,.
after pronouncing prophetically of
his scholar's rising fame, he de-
clares, that so far from regarding,
it with an eye of envy, he consi-
dered his own reputation advanced'
thereby in the fame manner as Leo-
nardo da Vinci's was by RafaelT
Castelfranco's by Titiano, or Plato's
by ^rifiofle.- Velazquez, who by
his marriage with Donna Juana
had established himself to his, con-
tent,. felt himself tempted to uat

dertalte ajourney to Madrid, where
and at the Escorial so many t'rea»
sures of art were amassed: In short,
having facrisiced to the foster pas-
sions, ambition came in turn to^
take dominion of his mind and,.
leaving Donna Juana at Seville, he-
fate out with one attendant only
for the capital, where he arrived;
in April of the year 1622, being
thettip his twenty-eighth. year, an.
age when the mind of man de-
mands expansion and a larger field.
of action than its native scenes pre-
sent. Velazquez upon this visit to
Madrid, not finding an opportu-
nity of painting any of the royal
persons of the court, returned af-
ter a short stay to Seville in some
degree of disgust.; and. here per-
haps

<page 27>
^iapB he. might have staid, as' Mu-
rillo afterwards did, for the je^
mainder of his lise, if he had nqs
been earnestly solicited to return
by the minister Olivares, who em~
ployed Gongora the court poet tq
invite him in his name and to offer
the accommodations of his house
and family to him. Such an invi-
tation was not to be withstood and
jn the year following (viz.^1623)
Velazquez for the second time ar-
rived in Madrid. . .
He was now lodged in the house
pf the prime minister and was soon
admitted to take the portrait of
the King, the Infants and.Olivares
himself: This was the most imme-
diate crisis of his fame and for-
tune. Phjlip had been painted by

<page 28>

most of the eminent artists of th«^
time, Vincencio Carducho and his
brother Bartolome, Angeh Nardi1,
Eugenia Caxes and Joseph Leonards
had successively exerted themselves
to the utmost in portraying the
royal person of a young sovereign
in possession of every thing, which
could rouse their emulation and
reward their diligence: In thd
house of the minister Philip fat to
Velazquez, . and the date of this
event is thought important enough
to be preserved to posterity, it was
on the 30th of August 1623: The
portrait was upon a large scale j the
King was drawn in armour and
mounted upon a magnificent steed
and displayed with all the advan-
tageous accompaniments of a beau-

rtisul scenery in the back-ground-:
The artist succeeded to his wisli >
the court rang with applause and .
all the cognoscenti joined in giving
the palm to Velazquez above all
his predecessors: So compleat was
his triumph on this happy occa-
sion, that the minister was com-
manded to inform his inmate that
the Royal person of Philip would
in future be committed to no other
pencil but his. In consequence
he proceeded to paint the Infants
Don Carlos and Don Fernando^
and after them he made a portrait
of his patron Don Gaspar de Guz-
man Conde de Olivares, mounted,
like his Royal master, on a noble
Andalusian courser, richly cap*- .
risoned. If I may venture an ob^
7 servation

<page 30>
t n }
servation in the general upon these
and others of his royal portraits, it
is, that there seems a labour in the
artist, -working under the impres-
sion of the personal dignity of his
sitters, to force a character of the
sublime, which sometimes borders
on the tumid and bombast: Every
thing swells and flutters; rich as
the Spanish horses are by nature,
still there seems a pleonasm in their
manes and tails, that borders on
extravagance: But the reader
should be reminded, that Rubens
-was now at Madrid in habits of in-
timacy "with Velazquezy that he
had painted his figure of San
<5iorgio flaying the Dragon, the
very quintessence of colouring
and the most captivating example

<page 31>
E 1
©f extravagance which the art of
painting can perhaps exhibit.
On the 17 th day of. March in
this year Prince Charles of Eng-
land had made his entry into Ma-
drid; that Prince honoured Ve-
lazquez with peculiar attention.
He did not sit to him, but Velaz-
quez took a sketch of him as he
was accompanying King Philip in
the chace. When Velazquez had
finished his portrait of the King, .
he hung it up by royal permission
in a public. street of the city, op-*
posite the convent of San Phelipe;
whilst the courtiers applauded it
to the Ikies, and . the poets made
sonnets in his praise,. the artists
silently passing by, pined with en-
vy at the sight. Fortune now be-

gan to open all her treasures to the
meritorious and happy Velazquez.
On the last day of October 1623
he was made King's painter with
a falary of twenty ducats per month,
exclusively of which he was paid
for his pictures by tale: The royal
munificence assigned him a hand-
some house to live in of two hun-
dred ducats a year; Philip paid
him three hundred ducats for his'
portrait and granted a pension of
three hundred more by year speci-
fically for this performance. Great
rewards being thus heaped upon
Velazquez, great things were ex-
pected from him and, though
the public subscribed to his supe-
riority in portraitures, he had not
executed yet any capital historical

piece, as his competitors Caxes,
Carduchio and Nardi had done,
Each of these had signalized them-
selves on a subject os great popular
eclat, the Expulsion os the Moors
out of Spain by Philip the HId;
he again entered the lists with
these artists and, following them
in their subjects, exhibited a su-
perb composition, in the center of
which he placed the King armed
and in the act of giving directions
to a party of soldiers, who are es-
corting a groupe of Moors of dif-
serent ages and sexes to an embar-
kation, which awaits them in one
extremity of the canvass; on the
opposite side he has personified the

was made Usher of the Chamber, an
office of great rank ajid honour; and
in further support of his new dignity
Philip added a stipend of a daily
tation of twelve rials and a yearly
suit or habit of ninety ducats value.
In this year Rubens made his se-
cond visit to Madrid in quality of
Ambassador; the intimacy, which
he formed with Velazquez and the
ideas he thereby inspired into him
of the state of th'e arts in Italy,
raised an irresistible desire in that
ambitious artist of prosecuting fur-'
ther improvements in the study of
the antique and in the schools and'
'collections in Rome. Velazquez
was now in such favour, that her
had no sooner expressed his wishes

for a tour to Italy, than lie found
himself anticipated in, every prepa-.
rative. for his undertaking; that
the indulgence of his. Sovereign
could provide. His Majesty gave-
him four hundred ducats -and two.
years.falary to defray his expences,
and Olivares upon parting added
two hundred ducats.more in;gold
and a medal with the head of the
King and many recommendatory
letters: He left Madrid in com-
pany with Don Alonso ETpinola,
the King's general in Flanders,
and embarked at Barcelona on the
seast of San Lorenzo: In August
1629 he landed at Venice, and
was lodged at the Spanish ambas-
fador's house, who mewed him
all possible kindness and directed

<page 37>

his servants to attend him, when-
ever he went out. In Venice he
copied a picture of Tintoreto's>
but, not chusing to make any
long abode there, he took his route
to Rome, passing thwragh Ferrarar
where he was very honourably en-
tertained by Cardinal Saeheti, who
had been nuncio in Spain, with
whom he passed two days: In
Rome he was lodged in the Vati-
can by favour of Cardinal Barbe-
rino, who gave him access at all
times to the works of Rafael and
Michael Angelo Bonarrota: Of these
great authors he studied the most
capital productions with unremit-
ting attention arid delight; but
his health being impaired by in-
tense application, he was directed
into

<page 38>
f OJ J
into a more airy part of the city,
in the house of the Florentine am-
bassador through the- favour of the
Con.de de Monte Rey, Philip's
ambassador at Rome: Being now
convalescent, he gave himself up
to the study of the antique for the
space of two months. During his
abode in Rome he painted his ce-
lebrated history of Jacob, when his
sons shew the bloody garment Of
Joseph, a picture, which in all the
great requisites of persection is
scarcely to be exceeded and is un-
doubtedly one of his most capital'
performances; he also painted the
Discovery of Venus's Infidelity,.
as related by Apollo to Vulcan,
who is represented at his forge

Cyclops, a wonderful piece of ex-
pression: Both these pictures he
transmitted to King Philip, who
ordered them to his palace of the
Buen-Retiro, from-whence that of
Joseph was removed to the Escorial,
where it now hangs, an illustrious
accession to that invaluable collec-
tion. ^ _ . . , o:
Velazquez, after a yeajf and a
half's absence, returned to Ma-,
drid, taking Naples in. his way,
where he made a portrait of Donna
Maria de Austria> Qiice.n of Hun-
gary, consort of Ferdinand the Ill.d:.
Absence had not impaired his fa- ,
vour with the King, .who made.
him one^of the gentlemen. of his.

In 1638 Velazquez made a portrait'
of Don Francisco HId, Duque de
Modena, who was then at Madrid,
and in the fame year he painted
his famous crucisix now in the con-
vent of the monks of San Placido
at Madrid; aod surely, if there
were nothing but this single figure

quez, this alone were sufficient:. It

in the depression of the head and a
harmonious tone of colouring, at
once so tender and of such effect,
that nothing can exceed it- I visit-
ed this exquisite production re-
peatedly and every time with new
delight and surprize. The wretched
cell or cabin, where it hangs, af-
fords but little light thro'' the iron
grate of a window not glazed and
that little is unfavourable: Mount
Calvary itself was scarce more dis-
mal. In the fame year Velazquez.
finished a portrait of Don Adrian.
Pulido Parefa, Admiral of the
King's fleet in New Spain: This
officer was under orders for repair-
ing tahis command, when Philip,.

upon entering the chamber of Ve-
lazquez then at work upon this por-
trait, mistaking it for the Admiral1
himself, entered into sudden exr-
postulation with him for staying at
Madrid beyond his time; declaring.
to Velazquez^ after discovering his
mistake, that it was so persect a
counterpart of the Admiral, that
with no light in the room but what'
struck immediately upon the fi-
gure, he had for sometime actually
believed it to be the person him-
self,. and was surprized at finding
him there in disobedience to his-
orders. In painting this picture
Velazquez used pencils with very
long handles to produce more ef-
sect by distance; this admirable
n -"-'.:0'>portrait

[ 28 ]
portrait was in possession of the late
Duque de Arcos.
It may well be expected to find
the performances of this period of
Velazquez's lise executed in his
best stile, when his taste was form-
ed by study at Rome, his judg-
ment matured by experience and
his fire not yet abated by years .>
caressed by his sovereign, applaud-
ed by his contemporaries and at
the summit of all worldly pros-
perity. In 1643 the minister Oli-
vares was dismissed from his em-
ployments and confined to his town
of de TorO, where -he died on the
2ad of July 1645, and his body
was permitted to be removed for
interment by the barefooted Car-
melites at Loeches in the convent

of' his own foundation. The good
fortune of Velazquez received no-
shock by the disgrace of his patron.
It is to be mentioned to his honour
upon this event, that he did not
forfake his benefactor in misfor-
tune, but took occasion, notwith^
Handing his employ at court,. to-
fee Don Gafpar de Guzman in his'
exile and give him one, and per-
haps the only, example of an un-
shaken attachment;. the healing
consolation, which such a visio
must bring with it to a mind gall-
ed by ingratitude and languishing
under the inquietudes of dis*
appointed ambition, need not be
pointed out: It is an amiable trait
in Philip's character, that he faw=
this attachment- and susfered it*
,' without

[ jo J
'without withdrawing any portion
of his favour from Velazquez this
I think is clear from his giving him
this very year the honour of the,
gold key and taking him with him
vpon his second journey to Zarago-
za: He had accompanied the King
into Aragon the year before Oli-
vares's disgrace, when Philip made
his expedition for quieting the tu -
mults in Cataluna this was re-
peated in 1644 and now his favou-
rite artist attended him as groom of

mission of Lecida to Philip on the.

tered it m person on the 7 th of
August following, Veiazquez made
a magnificent portrait of the King

the insignia of a general, an inesti-
mable work: He drew the Cardinal
Infante Don Fernando, Philip's
brother, the Queen Donna Ifabel
richly habited, mounted on a beau-
tiful white palfrey, and the prince
Don Carlos, very young, in armour
with a general's staff in his hand on
a Spanish jennet in full speed: He
made many other portraits of il-
lustrious persons, Don Francisco de
Quevedo Villegas, Cardinal de
Borja y Velasco, Archbisiiop of
Seville and Toledo, the learned
Simon de Roxas and others.'' He
drew the King again on horseback

In the year 1648 Velazquez was
dispatched upon a particular em-
bassy to Pope Innocent X. and was
at the fame time commissioned by
the King to purchase statues and
pictures in Italy for the royal collec-
tion; on this- expedition he fate
out from Madrid in the month of
November and embarked at Ma-
laga with Don Jayme Manuel de
Cardenas, Duque de Naxera, who
was going to Trent a efperar a la
Reyna Donna Maria Ana de Austria,
daughter of the Emperor Ferdinan-
dollldand Donna Marialnfanta of
Spain. Velazquez landed in G«noa„
passed through Milan> Padua and
from thence to Venice, where he
passed

<page 48>
C 33 J
passed some time in reviving his ac-
quaintance with the admired com-
positions of Titiano, cfinioreto,Paulo
Verones and others; and here he had
the good fortune to purchase some
capital pictures, as likewise in Bo-
logna, where he engaged Miguel
Colona and Agustin Miteli to go
into Spain to execute some paint-
ings in fresco for the King. He
made some stay in Florence and
paid a visit to the Duke of Modena,
who received him with great cor-
diality and showed him the por-
trait he had painted at Madrid,
splendidly equipped and disposed
to all possible advantage in the best
apartment of the palace \ from
hence he went to Parma to view
the works of the celebrated Cor-

regio, and whilst he was on his
way from Parma to Rome, he was
called away to Naples by express
from the Viceroy Conde de Onate,
who had received the King's com-
mands to conser with Velazquez
upon the objects of his commis-
sion; here he was visited by the
famous Ribera, a Knight of the
order of\Christ. When he arrived
in Rome he was received with
great kindness and distinction by
the Pope, and as he found many
hours, when the duties of his em-
ploy did not engage his attention,
he painted many portraits in Rome
of dignified persons after the ex-
ample of Rubens during his em-
bassy at Madrid. Innocent X.

his satisfaction, gave ,him a magr
nificent golden medal. Velazquez
sent a copy of this picture over to
Spain. He made a portrait of
J.um 4e Parexa the painter, which
being exhibited to the public on
the feast of San Joseph, after the
departure of Velazquez, it was so
univerfally applauded> that the
academicians of Rome elected him
of their body and sent his appoint-
ment after him to Spain. It was
not till the year 1651, that Velaz-
quez took his departure by sea
from Genoa on his return to Spain,
freighted with a very grand col-
lection of antique statues, busts
and some pictures of the most cele-
brated masters. He arrived iri
fafety with his cargo, and was re-

ceived by Philip With his accus-
tomed favour; The Queen Donna
Ifabel de Bourbon had died whilst
Velazquez was absent, and the
King had wedded Donna Maria
Afia de Austria.
In 1652, Philip bestowed upon
Velazquez, a very distinguishing
mark of his favour by appointing
him Aposentador major of his royal
palace in the room of Don Pedro
de Torres, an osfice to be filled
by none but men of eminent pre-
tensions either in rank or service,
and after his return from Italy it
appears, that Philip took him into
absolute confidence, passing many
hours in private with him and ad-
yising with him upon affairs of the
greatest delicacy and importance.

It was at this time Velazquez. de-
signed and executed his famous
picture, in which he has* repre-
sented himself at his easel with his
pallet in one hand and his pencil
in the other; the picture, pa which
he is working, is the portrait of
Donna Margarita Maria of Austria,
Infanta of Spain, and afterwards
Empress of Germany. It is re-

Velazquez in obedience to his
orders removed forty-one capital
pictures to the Efcorial, col-
lected by Philip, of all which he
presented to the King a full and
critical- description and account.

ing according to the rules of the
.order issued his mandate to the
Marquis de Tabara the president
to examine and report. the proofs

lazquez, which being complied
with and presented to the King,
'Philip turning himself to Velaz-
quez with a smile, that express
every riling most gracious and
complacent, replied, Give him the
order, -for Jknow his noble birth and
the right he has to it; and thus at
once made needless any further
scrutiny and examination. As a
further grace to this distinguished
artist, Philip appointed his inves-
titure for the seast of San sP^ospero,

;,which was the day of the Prince of
Asturias, who bore that amongst
his names; and thus upon the

with the insignia of the order by
the hands of Senor -Don Gafpar
Juan Alonso Perez de Guzman,
athen Conde de Niebla and after-

extraordinary had demanded the

of his office fate out before the-
court; the King followed with the
Infanta; they passed through Al-
cala, Guadalaxara and Burgos, in
which capital Velazquez waited to
receive the further orders of his
sovereign for fitting and preparing
the ceremonials of the interview:
The house appointed for this pur-
pose was in the Ifle de los fayfanes
upon the river Vidafas near to Irun
in the province of Guepuzcoa.
Velazquez advanced to this place in

company with the Barow- lle-Bate-
billa, Governor of San-Sebastian,
for the purpose of putting kin pro-
per order and condition.-for the re-
ception of the royal personages,
who were there to meet; this in-
terview took place in the month of
June, when Louis the fourteenth,
after being splendidly regaled and
having interchanged several mag-
nificent presents with the Catholic
King, received his bride and
Philip returned to San Sebastian.
In all these splendid ceremonials
Velazquez officiated in quality of
his post, adorned with the i-ufignia
of his knighthood and other dig-
nities, magnificently apparelled in
a vest of golilla with rich silver lace
of Milan, according to the fashion

of the times; on his cloak the red
cross, profusely adorned with dia-
monds and other precious stones,
a beautiful silver-hiked sword of
exquisite workmanship with figures
in relievo, made in Italy; a costly
gold chain round his collar, with
the order of Santiago appending
to tit in a magnificent setting of
diamonds.
The King returned through
Guadarrama and the Efcorial to
Madrid, and Velazquez at the sum-
mit of all worldly happiness and
prosperity hastened to enjoy the
congratulations and embraces of
his family. What must have been

when he was met with melancholy
and dejected countenances by all

his houshold, on account of hi*
death being predicted to them by
several of the court. Velazquez
was too considerable a man to fall
without some traditional prefages
of his death; this is a tribute,
which the superstition of the time'
generally demands and, if chance
does not furnish the fact, invention
must supply it and biographers
must record it: On the eve of San
Ignacio, at the end of the month
of July in 1660, Velazquez, hav-
ing attended his functions at court,
complained of being unusually fa-
tigued and sickened that night.;
his family physician Don Vicencio
Moles was immediately called in;
the alarm of his illness soon reach-
ed the King; the royal physician*
:.. E 2 Don

<page 67>
[ 5* ]
Don Miguel de Alva and Don Pe-
dro de Chavarri were sent to assist,
and the sever, (as well may be be-
lieved) kept pace with their assist-
ance. The King, after so many
splendid favours bestowed upon
Velazquez through the course of his
reign, added the last melancholy
office of friendship by sending to
him a spiritual comforter in the
person of Don Alonso Perez de
Guzman, a good and pious prelate,
Archbisnopof Tyre in partibus in-
fidelium and Patriarch of the In-
dies: He supported himself against
the violence of his distemper and
the medicines -of his doctors till
the evening of the 6th of August,
when this great artist, at the age
of 66, having compleated a lise of
uninterrupted

<page 68>
t 53 1
uninterrupted selicity and fame, re-
signed it with becoming fortitude
and composure; lamented by his
Sovereign, and regretted by all
but those,. who envied his talents
and prosperity. Philip who naturally
was a lover of the. arts, under the
tuition of Velazquez had. become
a judge; the:hours, which he had
dedicated to .the society of this
elegant and grateful: instructor,
were the most serene and pleasing
passages of his lise: His ^attach-
ment to Velazquez had been caused
by admiration of his talents, but
it was closed and confirmed by
experience os his discretion, fide-
lity and virtue: This attachment
had been now coeval,,with his
reign; it had feltno*interruption

or abatement, had outlasted all
those political ones, to which for
a time he had so absolutely sur-
rendered himself: In the revulsion
of his asfection from his favourite
Olivares, a shock which might na-
turally be thought decisive against
Velazquez, Philip had the mode-
ration to admit of sharing his at-
tentions with a minister, whom he
had discarded; a self-submission
disficult for any man, but doubly
so for one possessed of arbitrary
power; the grateful vassal selt his
Sovereign's magnanimity and knew
the value of the sacrifice; from
that period his devotion was un-
bounded, and Philip's confidence
kept pace with it so effectually,
in spite of all the peevish efforts of
- - the

<page 70>
[ 55 3
the envious, that he possessed his
favour undiminished to the last
hour of lise: That event deprived
the King of a resource and made
a gap in his enjoyments, which he
could never more fill up; the loss
to Philip was irreparable, and no-
thing now remained but to pay the
last honours to the memory of
Velazquez with a solemnity, that
should at once mark the love he
bore his person and the esteem he
entertained for his merits: This
was effectually performed and Ve-
lazquez was attended to his grave
in the parochial church of San
Juan,- by a train of courtiers and
Grandees, with the band of the
Royal chapels and all the funeral
ceremonies of the most splendid

Alfaro of Cordova, a disciple of
Velazquez, in partnership with his
brother Henry a physician, com-
posed the following epitaph, which,

in elegance, will recompense him

Francisco Zurbaran, though a
native of Fuente de Cantos in the
neighbourhood of Seville, studied
in Estremadura under one of the
scholars of El Divino Morales;
before he had persected himself
with this master, his parents re-
turned with him into Andalusia to
the place of his nativity, and en-
tered him in the school of the ce-
lebrated Canon Pablo de las Roelas
at Seville, who, as we have before
observed, was a disciple of Titiatfo.
In this academy Zurbaran applied
himself

<page 75>
[ 6o ]

himself with such diligence and
success to his art, that he soon ac-
quired the reputation of an emi-
nent painter; struck with the bold
esfects of Caravaggio's clear-ob-
scure, he adopted his stile of co-
louring, at the fame time adhering
closely to nature without extrava-
gance or.caprice: His first com-
positions acquired great fame, and
are in the second cloyster of the
barefooted Merced in Seville:
They represent the history of San
Pedro Nolasco, and all the reli-
gious being in white habits, the
draperies are managed with great
art and delicacy: Many other of
his paintings are in this city and
several in Cordova; such was the
reputation of this artist, that when
it

<page 76>
[ 6i ]
it was reported that he was about
to settle at Fuente de Cantos, the
magistrates and people of Seville,
alarmed at the idea of losing so
celebrated an artist and so excellent
a citizen, deputed certain of their
body to wait upon Zurbaran by
commission and entreat him not to
depart out of their city for the pur-
pose of settling elsewhere: He
obeyed the flattering deputation
by revoking his design, but the
commands of the King were soon
after signified to him by Velazquez
in the year 1650, calling him up
to Madrid: To these orders the
citizens of Seville opposed no re-
monstrance, nor could he easily
demur in the case. Upon his ar-
rival in Madrid he was employed
in

<page 77>
s ]
in the Retiro, where he executed
the paintings of Hercules and was
in great favour with Philip the
IVth. He painted several pic-
tures for the Cafa de Campo and
the other Royal Sitios; many of
his performances are dispersed in
the churches, and not a sew in
private hands: He died at the age
of 66 years in 1662. Zurbaran
was made King's painter, and
Philip, who had a mode of bestow-
ing his favours peculiarly gracious,
announced his appointment by tel-
ling him, that having been for
some time King of the Painters, it
was fit he should henceforward be
Painter to the King; whilst this
'was faying Philip had gently rested
his hand upon the shoulder of
. . Zurbaran,

<page 78>
[ *3 ]
Zarbaran, accompanying his fa-
vour with one of those familiar ac-
tions of princely condescension,
which are better selt than described
and which, if they do not consti-
tute the essence of generosity, cer-
tainly are the ornament of it.
Antonio del Castillo y Saavedra
of Cordova, was of a very noble
stock and studied painting under
his father Agufiin del Castillo, at
-whose death he went to Seville
-and persected himself in the aca-
demy of the abovementioned Zur-
.baran: Many valuable paintings
in the cathedral of Cordova bear
testimony to Cajlillo's merit, and
if his colouring had been equal to
iiis drawing, it would not have
.been easy in this catalogue to have

[ 64 ]
sound his superior. In the church
of San Francisco in his native city
of Cordova there is a composition
of his representing the baptism of
the Saint, which he painted in
competition with Alfaro, and as
that painter was in the habit of
signing all his pieces with his name,
which Castillo imputed to vanity,
he wrote at the foot of this canvass,
Ncn fecit Alvaro. In 1666 he re-
turned to Seville, where he had
not been since his youth; Murillo
was then in general vogue and at
the height of his fame; some of
his productions were shewn to Cas-
tillo; he surveyed them for a time
with mute astonishment and fur-
prize; he faw Nature reflected in
her most persect shapes and with a
0 brilliancy

<page 80>
£ H )
brilliancy of pencil, which he was
conscious he did not possess, and
probably did not believe to be
within the power of the art; at
length he recovered his speech and
turning from the object exclaimed
with a sigh, Ta murib Castillo!
Castillo is no more: He returned
to Cordova; seized with disgust
he abstained from his art, and ve-
rified his prediction before a year
had expired, pining away in me-
lancholy .and despair; with such
painful sensibility are some men
.constructed, that to take away their
opinion of their own superiority is
in effect .to take away their lives.
I have enquired into this circum-
stance, as related by Palomino, and

qvfestiohabfe tradition. The reader
may be apt to conclude that Cas-
////awasa man of insufferable self-
conceit and corroded -with envy;
to the contrary of this there is not
to be found upon record an artist:
of more distinguished good quali-
ties, or more complacent disposi-
tion: In accounting for the ope-
rations of a sensitive mind acting
upon a delicate frame of body,
there seems to be no occasion for
making the malevolent 'passions
accefliry to an event like this
which took place in the person of
pOor dastlllo: The deduction, which
I mould recommend to be drawi|

suaded I shall be anticipated by

such being the srail materials, p|"
which men of tender seelings, and
more especially prosessors of the
fine arts, are too apt by nature to
be compounded, we ought to.re-
gard their infirmity with compas-
sion and be cautious how we at-
tempt to derogate from that ex-
cuseable self-opinion, which is so
inseparable from talents and so .es-
sential to man's happiness.; In this,
view.of the case perhaps that species
of detraction, which a court of law
will not denominate a libel, in..a.
court of conscience and in the eye.
of Heaven shall amount to mur-.
aer. I had almost forgot to a;dd;
that Castillo was a poet.. . j. ^......
The genius of Velazquez was of
that quality, that to be within the
F 2 sphere

<page 83>
[ 68 ]
sphere of its activity was in some
degree to partake of its enthusiasm,
at least where its attraction met
with any particles that were of
correspondent quality. A Have,
by name Juan de Pare/a, a Mu-
latto, was employed in mixing his
colours and seeding his pallet ; from
pointing the arrows of Apollo he
became ambitious of trying his
'strength at the bow: The disqua-
lification of his condition neverthe-
less was such, that to touch the
most liberal of arts with the hand
of a Have was danger in the ex-
treme: The Casts in India do not
stand osf at greater distance from
each other, than degrees of men
do in Spain, and Velazquez was of
all masters the least likely to brook
a

<page 84>
[ «9 ]
a violation so presumptuous as
that which Pare/a meditated:
Hung round with chains of gold
and courtly orders, of haughty
pretensions in point of family and
high in favour and familiarity with
his Sovereign, Velazquez would"
have treated the insolence of his
flave, as Jupiter did that of Salmo-
neus, by extinguishing his exist-
ence: Notwithstanding the temp*
tation was for ever present and the'
impulses of genius in the end be-
came irresistible; in the stolen-
moments of his master's siesta, or
when court avocations called him
from home, Pare/a seized the clan-
destine opportunities and by the
force of talents became in time an
accomplished artist. Ambitionnow

<page 85>
inspired him with higher projects,
*nd as the liberality of Philip held
put a general asylum to merit, he
determined upon a method of in-
troducing his performances to the
eye of the King: He observed it
was his practice in Velazquez's
ehamber to order the pictures, that
stood with their faces to the wall,
to be turned that he might see .
them; this suggested to him the
thought of substituting one of his
own productions, and taking his
chance for what should follow.
Iphe expedient happily took place,
an& the King coming in to the aca-
demy, ordered the canvass to be
turned; Pare/a eagerly obeyed and
presented to the royal view a piece
.composed by the audacious pencil


<page 86>
£ 71 )
of a slave and a Mulatto, but such
an one in point of excellence, as
would have done honour to a freer
and a fairer artist: It was not easy
to appeal to better judgment than
the King's, or enter upon his trial
at a more merciful tribunal: Pa-
resa sell upon his knees, and avow-
ing the guilt of . the performance,
implored protection against the re-
sentment of his master for having
secretly purloined his art. Velaz-
quez, fays the King, you must not
only overlook this transgression in
Pare/a, but observe that such ta-
lents should emancipate the pos-
sessor. The generous decree was
obeyed by Velazquez, and Pare/a
had his freedom; the grateful
freed man continued his voluntary
\, F 4 service

service till the death os Velazquez,
and after his death to his daugh-
ter, who married Don Juan Baup-
tista del Mazo. I -wish I could
add that I had seen any of his
works, but I understand he was
eminent in portraits and copied
very ably the stile and manner of
his master: Pare/a died at Madrid
in 1670 aged sixty years.
Alonso Cana may be stiled the
Michael Angela of Spain, he ex-
celled as Painter, Statuary and
Architect, and it is disficult to de-
cide in. which branch his talents
were most conspicuous: He was
born in the city of Grenada in
1600: His father was an eminent
architect and educated him in his
own' profession; , the genius of

<page 88>
[ 73 ]
Jlonfo was not to be limited to
one department in the arts or sci-
ences; he had industry to combat
any difficulties, ardour to under-
take and readiness to apprehend.
When he had completed'his theo-
retical studies under his father, as
far as his instructions could carry
him in architecture, he applied'
himself to the more animating stu-
dy of sculpture and made an un-
common progress in a very shert
time; he next repaired to Seville
and admitted'himself as one of Pa-
checo's disciples, he staid eight
months with him and then com-
pleated' himself under Juan del
Castillo, in whose academy he exe-
cuted many noble paintings for
public edifices in Seville, and at'

of his excellence in statuary, which
were persectly astonishing in so
early a proficient; being then only
twenty^four years of age. Cano
Was of a noble family and so high-
roinded that in his early practice
he would not admit of being paid
for his productions, excusing him-
self by declaring that he worked
for reputation and practice, and
that he considered himself as yet so
Unfinished and impersect in his art,
that he could not in conscience ad*
r mit of any recompence: Never-
theless in this early period of lise
he exhibited some, statues of such
superior workmanship, in particu-
lar a Madoqna and Child, now in

and San Pablo, that the Flemish
artists, bearing of their fame* came
into Andalusia to copy them, and
returned in admiration at his talents.
Cam, who was generous and
gallant in the extreme, was of &
turbulent and fiery temper, and
having upon spme occasion quar-
relled with Sffajiian de Lianas y
Veldts, a painter of eminence iij
Seville, he challenged him so single

the suite of the Conde Duque,
and under his protection came
to Madrid'; an artist of his exten-
sive capacity was not likely to
be overlooked by Philip, and in a
short time he was made First RoyaF
Architect, King's Painter, and'
Teacher to the Prince Don Bal-
fhazarCarlos de Austria. As archi-
tect he projected several additional'
works to the palaces, some public
gates to the city and a triumphal'

was now left to but to fly and

betook himself to the asylum of
a Carthusian convent at Porta Cœli

Here he seemed for a time deter-

either the austerities of that habit,
or some khopes of returning with
impunity to a course of lise more

was even rash enough to return to
Madrid, thinking to conceal him-
self in the house of his father Don
Rafael Sanguineto. He made se-
veral paintings here as well as with
the Carthusians, and not being of
a temper to maintain any lasting
restraint over himself, he neglected
to keep house with Don Rafael,
and was apprehended in the streets,
and directions were given for putr
ting him to the torture: Cano de-
fended himself by the plea of ex-
cellens in arte, and he obtained so
much mitigation as to have his
right arm exempted from the liga-
ture; he susfered the rack, and
had the resolution under his tor-

any confession, not uttering'a single

related to Philip, he received him
again into favour, and as Cano saw-
there was no absolute fasety but
within the pale of the Church, he
solicited the King with that view
and was named Residentiary of
Grenada: The Chapter objected
to his nomination, and deputed
two of their body to represent to
Philip against the person of Cano-,
enumeratingmany disqualifications
and amongst the rest want of
learning: The King dismissed the
Deputies bidding them proceed
to admit his nomination, and tel-

these complainants, as Charles the
Vth did to his courtiers in the case
of Titiano: The Church of Gre-
nada profited by his appointment,
many sculptures and paintings be-
ing of his donation, and some he
also bestowed upon the church of
Malaga. A Counsellor of Grenada
having refused to pay the sum of
one hundred pistoles for an image
of San Antonio de Padua which
€ano had made for him, he dashed
.the Saint into pieces on the pave-
ment of his academy, whilst the
stupid Counsellor was reckoning

wa$ .bold enough to demolish a
Saint, would have very little re-
morse in destroying a Lawyer.
Happily for Cana the story did
not reach the ears of the Inquisi-
tors, else he would have had a se-
cond rehearfal of his former tor-
tures and the doom of Torrigiano;
but he escaped with no other pu-
nishment than a suspension from
his function by the Chapter of
Grenada, to which however he was
restored by the King, but not un-
till he ha'd sinished a magnificent
crucifix, which the Queen had
commissioned him to carve and
which he had long. neglected to
perform. This pasted in the year

1658; from this period'to his
death he led ah exemplary lise of
great charity and devotion; when
he , had no money to bestow in
alms, which was frequently the
case, he would call for paper and
give a beggar a drawing, directing
him where to Carry it for fale; but
to Jews he bore such antipathy
that he considered every touch of
theirs as a contamination, arid in'
such cases would give away his
cloaths, forbidding however his
servant on whom he bestowed them,
on any account to wear what he
had cast off. On his death-bed he
would not receive the facraments
from a priest, who attended him,
because he had given them to the
converted Jews; and from another

he would not accept the crucifix
presented to him in his last rno-"
ments, telling him it was so bung-
ling a. piece of work that he could
notendure the sight of it; in this
manner died Æonso Casio at the age
of seventy-fix in the year 1676;
a circumstance which shows that
his ruling passion for the Arts ac-
companied him in the article of
death superseding even religion it-
self in those moments, when the
great interests of falvation natu-
rally must be supposed to occupy
the mind to the exclusion of every
other idea.
Had it not been that the perse-
cution of his judges deprived Cana
of that tranquillity, which is so ne-

fine arts, I am inclined to'think his
talents would have produced a dis-
play superior to any Spain had gi-
ven birth to.; . in the early period
of his lise, when the great artists
of Flanders thought a journey to
Spain well repaid by surveying and
copying his works, and when. he
had so strong an idea in his mind
of further excellence, that he re-
fused payment for productions he
regarded as impersect, he could
have given no greater evidence of
the true spirit and native genius
of an artist; the fame spirit at-

abhorrence from a disproportioned
and ill-carved crucifix, though to
that object the indispenfable duties
of his religion were affixed. Strong
indeed must be the enthusiasm of
that Virtuoso, who, when naked
and starving, was to refuse enter-
ing the door that was opened to
him,. because the rules of archi-
tecture were not observed in its
construction; if we may fay of
such a man that he loved. his art
better than his lise, we may pro-
nounce of Cano in stronger terms
that it was dearer to him than his
foul.

be true that the Inquisition had
its origin in the Crufades, it is the
legitimate child of persecution,
and has not degenerated from its
stock to the present' hour: False

usurps its name, and which at pre-
sent obtains in the asflicted and;
truly pitiable kingdom, where
this account has chiefly been com-
posed,. participates much of the
nature of inquisitorial proceedings,
and I am in this place tempted to
relate a fact, of which I was a very
interested and anxious spectator,
that will confirm what I have ad-
vanced- I had in my family at
Madrid a young man of exemplary
character, who lived with me in-
great trust and intimacy, and was
a native of that city, univerfally
known and respected in it; he had
been my guest but one night,
when the next day at the hour of
dinner the osficers of justice en-
tered-

tered my chamber, whilst a party
of soldiers paraded at my gates,
demanding the body of this unfor-
tunate victim ; -it was as vain to
ask to know the charge, as it was
impracticable to avoid or resist it5
after conditioning for the removal
of the soldiers, and some promises
of humanity on the part of the
judge, I surrendered to that ma-
gistrate a young man, born of Irish
parents, red-haired, of a fair com-
plexion, and without impediment
in his gait or person^ I mention
these circumstances because this
officer and his alguazils were in.

& natural defect in its formation.
In spite of the evidence of his own
eyes, the judge conducted my
guest to prison, hand-cuffed and
hauled between two fiend-like al-
guazils, in the sight of hundreds
of spectators, who followed him
through the streets silently com-
passionating his ignominy and mis-
fortune. The next day his books,
papers and effects were seized and
rummaged, where fortunately they
found no food for the Holy Office,
nor offence against the state. In
the regular course of proceeding
he should have laid in prison ten
or twelve years, if nature could
have subsisted for that time, before
he was allowed to fee his judge;
but at my instance he was speedily
.. admitted

C 93 ]j
admitted to an examination, and
I place it justly amongst the many
marks of kindness I was distinguish-
edwith in that kingdom, that justice
was made so to quicken her custo-
mary pace on my account. When
he was brought before the judge,
though every seature in his face
swore to the mistake of his com-
mitment, the necessary forms of
inquisition were not to be passed
over and he was called upon to re-
collect all the passages of his lise
and converfation, and to guess die
cause for which he was. arrested
and imprisoned: In persect sim-
plicity of heart he exposed to his
inquisitor all his history and habits
of lise with the whole of his cor-?
jespondence.and acquaintance, as
well

could bring it to recollection;
When this had passed and happily
nothing had dropt on which his
judge could fasten any new matter
-of crimination, he was coolly in-
formed he did not answer to the
<defcriptionof the selon they were
in search of, and that he was at li-
berty to return to the place from
which he came.
To such uneven hands is the
scale of justice delegated in some
states; with such tenants are the
towers of Segovia and Cadiz
peopled; and who that reflects on
this, and has the sentiments and

Don Juan de Alfaro y Gamon
of Cordova was a painter of too
great eminence to be passed over'
in silence; he was educated under
Castillo, and compleated. his studied
with Velazquez at Madrid, whose
stile he copied, particularly in his
portraits; in his latter manner he
inclined more to the .simplicity.
and. nature of Vandyke, and some
of his. paintings, particularly uptia
a reduced size, are not with-cer-
tainty to be distinguished from that
master.: Alfaro .attached himfekF

elegant gusto of the Italians, w In
his Rustics we beholds the lise it-

Costuma. There are many figures

years, of magic lustre and transpa-

expression of the eyes, that appears
to me to be peculiar and by itself i

His Baptist and his Saints, parti-

instances occasionally of great sub-
limity; but it is a sublimity, that
neither forces nor enlarges nature;
truth and simplicity are never out
of sight: It is what the painter
sees, not what he conceives, which
is presented to you: Herein he is
distinguishable from his preceptor
Velazquez; that great master by
his courtly habits and intercourse
with the great contracted a more
proud and swelling character, to
which the simple and chaste pen-
cil of Murillo never sought to as-

then on the throne, with a promise
of appointing him one os his Jtoyal

with him to accept the royal osfer

commissioned to desire that he
would send up some specimen of
his performances, that should be
equal in merit to the picture he
had exhibited at the solemnity
above-mentioned, for which he
fliould be rewarded with suitable
munificence: To this message
Miirillo could oppose no absolute

of Spain guards the possession of
these valuable remains of his art.
Besides the famous cloyster of San
Francisco, which we have already
noticed,. there is at Seville in the
christening chapel of the church of
thie Miraculous Paduan a celebrated
picture by this author, 'represent-
ing San Antonio with Christ under
a glory of Cherubims, the back
ground giving the perspective of

Saint is a table, on which is placed
a jar with lillies, so naturally re-

longer on a trisle than it merits^
to observe to the reader that the

including the lillies in question, was
put in by Valdez a contemporary
artist, so that we must rest the cre-
dit of MurilU upon some better
testimony than that of the monks

the Marquis de Yillamanrique:
The first design was to. have had the

and the landscapes or back-grounds

excelled in that branch of the art;

:'*nedy this difficulty Murillo exe-
cuted the whole without Iriarfe's
assistance, raking Jacob's history
instead of David's, and thus it came
to pass that these extraordinary
.pictures remain a monument of
Murillo''s genius in every branch of
the art, and a treasure truly ines-
timable in the possession of a fa-
mily, which by the precaution of
an absolute entail has guarded a-
gainst any future possibility of alie-
nation. The fame gentleman has
a Madona with the infant JesuS,

collection two full-length pictures,
companions in Viie and excellence,
which are superior to all the works
of this author in the Royal collec-
tion, -and which no stranger of
taste, who' visits Madrid, should
fail to fee; the one a Saint Joseph
leading by the hand a Christ of the
age of eight or ten years, and over
head a glory of Cberubims, the
back ground a landscape in a grand
stile -and -exquisite harmony; the
other, a Saint Francis Xavier in a
sublime and elevated attitude, 'his

spirit and enthusiasm, whilst a

so him the inspiration of the Deity,
previous to the commencement of
his miffion amongst the favages of
America, represented at distance
in the back ground in a consider-
able groupe amidst a scene finely
varied with sea and land. These
two pictures are sufficient to im-
mortalize the name of. MurUlo;
they appear to me to possess every
persection, of which the art is ca-
pable, both in respect of design as
well as execution: As I have never
received any competent idea of a
picture from description, I may
reasonably despair of conveying
any by it. . ;...

pressed with singular spirit, and is

Ghetto, of whom we have already'
spoken. His father Faustina Coello
was of the city of Tulbufino in the
bishbprick of Visco in Portugal.
He was educated in the academy
of the famous Francisco Ricci pain-
ter to King Philip III. and was
his favourite disciple; giving early
and repeated proofs of an extraor-
dinary genius he compleated his
studies under the tuition of this
great master, by whose means he
had access to the royal collection
and copied many works of Titian,
Rubens, Vandyke and Others.
As Coello never travelled out of
Spain and as sew if any of his pic-
tures are in private hands, there is
little probability of any of his
works being extracted from the

has yet found its way beyond the

he was a native of Madrid and rer
Ikkd there constantly, except when
he was employed in the Escorial
as a Royal Artist, many monu-
ments of his genius are to be
found in the convents and churches
of that capital; these I have traced
with an assiduity that has been
richly repaid; for though I have

a*id though I cannot absolutely
close with the enthusiasm of some

Goello decidedly at the head of the
Spanish school, preserring him to
Murillo, Ribera and even Vetaz-
quez, yet there can be no doubt
but he is to be ranked in the class.
of the first, though perhaps not
the first of the class.. His , ca-
pital picture de la Colocazian de
las Santas Fbrmas, on which he
expended seven years labour, is'
an amazing composition, and de-
servedly maintains its rank at the
akar of the grand facristy of Saint

ture of very high pretensions tho'
in such a neighbourhood. In the
chapel of the nuns of Saint Pla-
cido there is a large altar-piece
of Coello's painting on the subject
of the Incarnation; the Holy Vir-
gin is displayed in the center of
the piece, above is a glory of
Angels, and in the fore-ground a
groupe of Prophets and Sybils who
announce the coming of the Mes-
sias» This was the first composi-
tion of Coello, and was executed
by him whilst in the school of
Francisco Ricci, It is a piece in
h,igh estimation, but the unfavour-
able light in which it is placed and
its great height from the eye, (the
figures being only of the natural
size) scarce allow the spectator to
form

<page 152>
farm any judgement of its exceli-
leiice. In the fame altar-piece, and
i-n various parts of the fame cha-.
pel there are many smaller paint-
ings of Coello and some flight
sketches in the pannels of the al-*
tars of distinguished merit::- Bus
of all the remains of this master
those which in my opinion deserve
to be ranked next to his altar-piece
in the Efcorial abovementioned:are
two pictures upon canvass in the
valuable collection of the Carme-
Htifh convent in the great street of
Alcala; but these again are^ in such
lights, or more properly in siich
want of light, that our gratifica-
tion scarce balances our regret.
On the whole it appears to me
that if Coello's works could be

reprieved from their imprisonment,
and were favourably disposed a-
mongst the great collections of
Europe they would hold a very
distinguished rank, wherever they
were placed; of all the masters of
established name and character I
am of opinion he most resembles
Paulo Veronese; his draperies,
colours and characters are mostly
of that cast and his compositions
fully on a level: In the nude I
have seen no specimens and I am
inclined to believe there are sew
if any to be found. In the pic-
tures belonging to the Carmelites,

King Charles the lId to paint the

Escorial and for other works. His

a number of compositions in Vari-

and no security can be placed in
such uncertain acquiescence;
;. . It would not be easy to account
for any rapid decline of sudden
dearth of art and science, where
there has been no want of encou-
ragement or scarcity of employ,
unless by reserring to some such
over-ruling cause, as I allude to:
People, who are curious to find a
natural reason for every event in
the history of the human mind,
have in the map of their discove-
ries laid- down the springs and
fountain-heads of genius in certain
happy latitudes, as those of Greece,
Italy and Spain; but at the same
time that a proper temperature of
climate -;s acknowledged necessary

.arts, and perhaps for the investi-
gation of many useful sciences, yet
-the hypothesis which some adopt
is far from fatisfactory; it would
-j>ot be easy to find a reason upon
.their principle, why the Athenians
should be ingenious and the The-
bans dull; for whatever may have
,been faid of the fogs of Bceotia in
poetical ridicule, tryth would tell
us that it was the thickness of intel-
lect in the native which gave the cli-
mate its character, and not the cli-
mate which condensed and clouded
the brains of the inhabitants, There
is reason to believe that the natives
x>f old Rome., who were so distipv-
.guilhed in science, were desective

and architects were Greeks^ md-
dern Rome on the contrary: has
jKgured more in arts and less
science, than any other ofxhe illu-
minated states of Europe; if her
-climate in the mean time has un-
dergone an alteration, it has cer-
tainly changed for the worse:
Whereas the air of Madrid by the
amendment of its -police must be
, greatly better, than it was when
the Austrian princes fate on the
throne; and if climate is ever to
come into consideration, as a mo-
ving cause of genius, it will leave
us at a loss to guess what kind of
inspiration could be drawn from
the stench of Madrid in times
past, which its present state of pur
rity is not competent to produce,;
for

<page 169>
for my part it is matter of fur-
prize to me, not only how talents
could be exerted, but rather how
lise could be endured in such an
atmosphere. If men' wjli abso-
lutely account for every thing by
system, let them take that of elim-
inate, it will serve as well as ano-
ther: But to speak naturally in the
case, it is observable and without
a doubt that the manners are
changing; the high-minded inde-
pendence of the \A-rragonians and
the steady, dignity .of the Caftilians
are in the waine; the churches and
convents faturated with virtu no
'longer make any demands upon
the arts; th« good Fathers have
-made a full /meal and* are. fallen
afleep after it. When ministers were

<page 170>

chosen from the body of the Nobles,
the power of the state was often
lodged in elegant hands, and the
whole order of Grandees seconded
rhe example of the Crown by en-
couraging talents; the policy of
the present century has been to ex-
elude the Nobility from any active
share in government, and under
the shade of R'oyal jealousy who
can wonder if their dignity has
drooped? Though the ambition of
subjects may be dangerous to a
Throne, it is oftentimes glorious
to a state: Shut out all the brighter

the present discussion, experience
has much to oppose to the advo-

were to enter into a discussion of
particulars, we should find per-
haps in each some reason, why a
public work has failed of being a
public benefit; to employ the arts
is one thing, but to improve them
is another: The sumptuous gar-
dens of San Ildefonso involved a-
mazing sums; they gave employ-
ment to a multitude of artists., who
seem to have exhausted their inge-
nuity in devising modes of tortu-
ring nature; the wilderness has at

not pretend to fayrj but I am cer-
tain that Verfailles would have

much irksome attendance and pro-
crastination, Juvarra was directed
with many symptoms of disfavour
to lower his projects, condemned
as extravagantly vast, and to re-
duce his scale to a more practi-
cable proportion? the health'df
the architect was now declining
apace; the vigour of a mind too
sensitive for a court was exhausted
by difappointment and chagrin,
and the present plan, which com-
paratively with the other is but the
abortive offspring of an enfeebled
parent, was soon followed by his
death: The author being dead, it
is little to be wondered at if many
errata crept into his copy; more
would have followed, if the timely
interposition df Sabatini, who con-
. M 4 eluded

<page 183>
eluded the building, had not
corrected many things and sup-
plied others with distinguished
ability; an instance of this is
the grand stair-cafe, the merit
of which is entirely with him, and
would do honour to the court of
Augustus: The site of the edi-
fice upon the antient foundation
has been the main impediment
and cause of many difficulties in
the construction of the whole; it
has been thought necessary to give
it such a foundation, or rather em-
bankment against the hill, after
the manner of the terrace of the
Adelphi, that as much masonry
has been expended below the sur-
face of the ground, as in the su-
perstructure; Juvarra's first ideas
had

<page 184>

had been directed to ^ fpo£ with-
out the walls of lyiadrid, where
the nature of the ground .admitted
of a much greater display upon the
fame scale of expence; and it can
neyer be enough lamented that ei-
ther. this situation, or that.of the
old palace of the Retiro had not
.been chosen in preserence: It is
placed as I before observed upoii
the site of the antient castle, on the
edge of a steep hill from which
there is a precipitate descent to the
river Manfanares, that forms $
very meagre current in the botr
torn: This river, which is flattered
with a very handsome bridge, has
its fits of flowing, when the snow
upon the neighbouring mountains
<?f Quadarama condescends to melt
and

<page 185>
and mike a vehicle of its channel';
in the mean time it stands in no
better capacity, as an auxiliary to
the town of Madrid, than by serv.^
fng for the general washing-tub of
the place; as an ornament to the
palace it contributes little else in
polrii of spectacle, but crowds of
washing-women not the fairest or
most silerit of their species, arid
rows of linen of every sort, size
and description in use for either
sex hang tip to dry upon its banks
in view of the apartments: This
palace, however faulty, is yet re-
spectable in its exterior, and doubly
fo in its contents. Sabatini, who
conducted the sitting, has collected
an assemblage of every thing splen-
did and ornamental that Spain
could

<page 186>
could offer to his choice}. far*r*
pies of the rarest and most beauti-
ful marbles from the quarries of

that Philip the IVch, whbfejudge-

the insinuation of Malvasia that he

Mengs in his remarks upon it, ad-
verting to this disparaging account
given by Malvafia, treats his opi-
nion and the whole of his pub-
lication with a contemptuous se-
verity, which all who are advo-
cates for the superiority of the Ro-
man school will think this author
deserves. It is well known that
this inestimable picture was fortu-
nately weighed up out of the sea,

as before-mentioned, is that of the
Saviour bearing his Cross to Mount
Calvary, designed in the back-
ground, and he is in that imme-^
diate action of prophecy, in which
he fays to the women who sur-
round him weeping, Daughters of
Jerusalem, weep not for me,
&c. The mother of Jesus is de-
scribed in a supplicating posture
interceding for pity from the sol-'
diers and spectators for her Son,

the spectacle appears to have in-

was a want of harmony in the com-
position; the carnations are all
remarkably brown and ruddy (in
his manner) nor are the sigures
and objects in the back-ground
kept down and softened as they
are seen in nature: These desects
in part may well be owing to un-
skilful retouches and bad modes
of cleaning and varnishing; one
remarkable circumstance is that of
a leg amongst the groupe without
an owner; a redundancy which
the author could never be guilty
of, and a collateral proof of the
bad hands through which it has

Rafael and Corregio. Some parti-
culars of this painter's history I
have extracted from Azara's pub- .

that his family wasoriginally ofLur ,
fatia, but had migrated from thence..

<page 202>

to Hamburgh where his grandfa-
ther settled for a time, and from
thence passed to Copenhagen; this
man had a very numerous issue,
and when the father of our painter
was born he had him christened by
the name of Iihmael, in pursuance
of a filly whim which struck him
of opening the Bible and taking
the first name in the first leaf that
his eye chanced to light upon:
Istimael was put to such masters as
Copenhagen afforded to learn t6
paint: He married the daughter
of one Cofre a Frenchman, under
whom he studied painting in oils,
but his wise objecting to the scent,
he diverted his talents thencefor-
wards to miniatures, and probably

made no great facrisice by his gal-
lantry. Soon after this marriage
he left Copenhagen upon the plea
of avoiding an epidemic distemper*
and took his peregrination through
seyeral of the German courts, and
in Austg in Bohemia, a town on
the borders of Saxony, on the inth
day of March 1728 was born An-
tonio Rafael Mengs, so named . in
honour of those great masters An-
tonio Alegri de Corregio and Rafael;
by these sounding characters our
infant painter wa$ ushered into
lise; Ishmael in some opinions
having been guided by a kind of
prophetical choice in preserring
these names to his own, from
which he seems to have inherited
little else but the vagrant character

os his Arabic appellation, dn<$ the
uncontroulable exercise of paternal
tyranny in full measure and ex-
tent. Ishmael began very early
to instruct his son in the principles
of drawing, and as he shifted his
quarters from Ausig to Dresden
better opportunities occurred for
advancing his education. In the
year 1741 he took him to Rome,
where he continued him under his
own tuition: Augustus the HId
of Poland had made Ilhmael one
of his royal painters during his
abode at Dresden, and Antonio was
now employed by his father in co-
pying some pictures of Rafael for
the King in miniature which were
sent to Dresden. Aster three years

his studies, he returned to Dres-
den ; here he was constituted King's
painter with a falary, and after a.
ame made a second journey i»'
Rome; he painted miniatures in-
compliance with his father's predi-
lection for his own branch of the-
art, during the first four years of
his residence, after which he com-
menced his career upon a greater
scale and exhibited a Holy Family
of his own composition which was
greatly applauded; his inclination
was to fix himself in Rome, hav-
ing married a young woman by
name Margarita. Guazzi, from
whom he had modelled the head

to return to Saxony, where he ar-1
rived in 1749; Mengs though
married and established as an artist
of reputation, was by no meah$
emancipated from-the tyranny of
his father; and although the King
was so gracious as to enlarge his
pension, he found his situation
renderedfo miserable and his health'
and fpirits so impaired by Ishmael's'
unfatherly treatment, that he teft'i^:
cited and obtained the royal leave to
return with his wife and an infant
daughter to Rome, where he arrived

but by raising the living: So far
therefore as this striking preser-
ence in favour of Mengs had effect
in calling forth his exertions and
fortifying his genius by a due pro*
portion of self-confidence and pro*
per opinion it appears to hawc
been kingly and meritorious:
Mengs himself with all his idolatry
for Rafael thinks the world has
produced artists with which he
cannot come into competition, and
what is singular in the opinion is>
that he does not reser to the works
of the Grecian sculptors, but to
their painters for that persection,
that idea of consummate beauty,
which he finds wanting in his own
great model. But as Mengs takes

<page 219>

wpch;is idea of the superiority of
the antient painters entirely upon
hypothesis, and no reserence being*
to be had to ocular conviction j'
which alone can settle the question,-
the world' will gain more by the
ingenuity of his conjectures, thart
truth will by his discovery. These"
are other positions' equally new in
his posthumous publication, which
'I shall be glad to see canvassed in
the true spirit of candid criticism;
Mengs loved the truth, but he did
not always find it out; under all
the difadvantages of a contracted
education, and sowered by the
insupportable severity of his fa+
ther's discipline, his habit became
saturnine and morose and his man-
ners unsocial and inelegant: He
r/t . Z had

<page 220>
[ *©l 3
had a great propensity for speak-
ing what are called plain truthsy
but which oftentimes in fact are
no truths at all: His biographer
and editor Azara has given us an:
instance of this fort in a reply ho
rnade to Pope Clement XIV. Hia
Holiness had asked Metigs's opi-
nion of some pictures he had col»
lected at Venice: They are good

rejoined his Holiness, they have

for their merit: Most Holy Fa-

tols what he cannot equal, and I
depreciate what I am sensible I can

pect that Clement thought very
little the worse of his pictures, and
not much the better of Mengs for
his repartee. Whether Mengs
really thought with contempt of
art which was inserior to his own,
I w$l not pretend to decide; but
that he was apt to speak contemp-
tuously of artists superior to him-
self I am inclined to believe:
Azara tells us that he pronounced
of the academical lectures of our
Reynolds, that they were caku^
lated to mislead young students in*.

he plainly avers are all that the

mediately proceeds to fay that
Mengs was of a temperament colé-
rico y adufto, and that his bitter
and fatyrical turn created him in-
finitos agraviados y quejosos. When
his historian and friend fays this
there is no occasion for me to repeat
the remark. If the genius of
Mengs had been capable of pro-
ducing a composition equal to that
of the tragic and pathetic Ugolino,
I am persuaded such a sentence as
the above would never have passed

vain and sickness rendered him.
peevish he found himself at Ma-
drid in a country without rivals,
and because the arts had travelled
out of his sight he was disposed to. ,
think they existed nowhere but on
his own pallet.. The time per-
haps is at hand, when our virtuosi
will extend their route to Spain,.
and of these some one will' probably
,be found, who, regarding with just .
indignation these' dogmatical ..de-
crees of MengSy will take in hand

the chrystal than it does in some
parts at least had it been less trans-
parent than it is; that it disco-
vers an abortive and puimy bam-
bino which seems copied from a
bottle; that Mengs was an artist
who had seen much, and invented
little; that he dispenses neither
lise nor death to his figures, ex-
cites no terror^ rouses no passions,
and risques no flights; that by
studying to avoid particular de-
fects, he incurs general ones, and
paints with tameness and servility;
