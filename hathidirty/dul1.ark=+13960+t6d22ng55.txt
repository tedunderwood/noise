 TH E time was now come 
 when Fortune, which had 
 hitherto fmiled upon the 
 Chinefe arms, refolved to turn tail 
 to that vain-glorious nation; and 
 precifely at the lame inftant Taycho 
 undertook to difplay his whole ca- 
 pacity in the management of the 
 war. But before he aflumed this 
 province, it was neceffary that he 
 fhould eftabliih a defpotifm in the 
 council of Twenty-eight, fome mem- 
 bers of which had ftill the prefump- 
 tion to offer their advice towards the

 cil being alTembled by the Dairo's 
 ^rder, to deliberate upon the objedls 
 of the next campaign, the prefi-

 Taycho> who was the youngeft mem-

 no articulate reply, but cried '* Ba-

 *^ Boh !" The Fatzman ejaculated

 hinted fomething of lunacy. . Fok- 
 li-rokhu fhook his head ; and Soo-

 At length, Fika-kaka going round 
 and kiffing Taycho on the forehead, 
 ^^ My dear boy (cried he) !^ — Gad's 
 curfe ! what's the matter } Do 
 but open the fluices of your elo-

 Fatzman ; and a rattle for my lord 
 Cuboy. I have, like wife, 'firgar-

 So faying, he, without ceremOnyV 
 advanced to the Dairo, and tied a; 
 fcarf round the eyes of his imperial 
 majefty : then he produced a num- 
 ber of padlocks, and fealcd up the 
 lips of every Quo in council, before 
 they could recoiled: themfelves from 
 their firft aftoniflimenr. The alfem-

 He growled like an enraged bear^ at 
 the indignity which had been offer- 
 ed to him, and kicked the Cuboy 
 before as well as behind, Mr. Ora- 
 tor Taycho was fain to come to an 
 explanation. He aflured the Dairo, 
 it was neceffary that his impe- ^ 
 rial majefty fhould remain in the 
 dark, and that the whole council 
 fhould be muzzled for a feafon, 
 other wife he could not accomplifh 
 the great things he had projecfted in 
 favour of the farm of Yeifo. He 
 declared, that while his majefty re- 
 mained blindfold, he would enjoy 
 all his other fenfes in greater perfec- 
 tion ; that his ears would be every

 tity of animal fpirits was expended 
 in vifion, the greater proportion- 
 would flow to his extremities ; con- 
 fequently, his pleafure would be 
 more acute in his pedcftrian exerci- 
 tations upon the Cuboy and others 
 whom he delighted to honour. He, 
 therefore, exhorted him to undergo 
 a total privation of eye-fight, which 
 was at beft a troublefome faculty, 
 that expofed mankind to a great va- 
 riety of difagreeable fpedtacles. This 
 was a propofal which the Dairo did 
 not relifh : on the contrary, hcf 
 waxed exceedingly wroth, and told- 
 the orator he would rather enjoy one: 
 tranfient glance of the farm of YeiTo, 
 than the jnoft exquiiite delights that 
 could be procured for all the other 
 fenfes. *' To gratify your majefty

 tended him y but begged leave to 
 decline the ceremony, on account 
 of the haemorrhoids, which at that 
 time gave him great dillurbance. 
 
 The orator having thus annihilated 
 all oppofition in the council of 
 Twenty-eight, repaired to his own 
 houfe, in order to plan the opera- 
 tions of the enfuing campaign. Tho' 
 he had reinforced the army in Tar- 
 tary with the flower of thejaponefe 
 foldiery, and deflined a ftrong fqua- 
 dron of Fune, as ufual, to parade on. 
 the coaft of China; he forefaw it 
 would be neceflary to amufe the 
 people with fome new ftroke on the- 
 fide of Fatfifio, which indeed was. 
 the original, and the moft natural 
 fcene of the war. He locked himfelf 
 up in his clofet, and in confulting the 
 map of Fatfifio, he found that the 
 principal Chinefe fettlement of that

 Quib-quab, to which -thece was accefo 
 by two different •aveniQes-.i;:i tone by a 
 :'brbad>. rapid, navigable xiver, on 
 the banks, jdf' which 'the town was 
 Tituated; and- the other by an inland 
 route; over mountains, lakes, and 
 •dangerous torrents. /He meafured 
 4h-ej ma:p withhis compafs, and per- 
 ceived that^both routes were 'nearly 
 of-the'^fame length ^ and therefore he 
 Tefolved that the forces in FatfiGo, 
 -being divided Into two equal bodies, 
 fliould approach the place by the two 
 different avenues, on the fuppofition 
 that they would both arrive before 
 the walls of Qiiib-quab at the fame 
 inftant of time.: li. The cbhdudl of the 
 inland expedition was'given to Yaff-

 eminently diflingulflied himielf in 
 the courfe of the preceding year. 
 
 Orator Taycho had received fome 
 articles of intelligence which em- 
 barraffed him a little at firil ; but 
 thefe difficulties foon vanifhed before 
 the vigour of his refolutions. He 
 knev^, that not only the town of 
 Quib-quab was fortified by art,, but 
 alfo, thai the whole adjacent coun- 
 try was almoft impregnable by na- 
 ture : that one Chinefe general block- 
 ed up the paffes with a ftrong body 
 of forces, in the route which was to 
 be followed by YaiF-rai ; and that, 
 another commanded a feparate corps 
 in the neighbourhood of Quib-quab,^^ 
 equal, at lead, in number to the de- 
 tachment of Ya-loff, whom he might 
 therefore either prevent from land- 
 ing, or attack after he fliould be 
 landed : or finally, fhould neither of 
 thefe attempts fucceed, he might re- 
 iaforce the garrifon of Quib-quab,

 fo as to make it more numerous than 
 the befieging army, which, accord- 
 ing to the rules of v/ar, ought to be 
 ten times the number of the beiieged. 
 On the other hand, in order to inva- 
 lidate thefe objedions, he refledted 
 that Fortune, which hath fuch a fliare 
 in all military events, is inconflant 
 and variable ; that as theChinefe had 
 been (o long fuccefsful in Fatfifio, it 
 was now their turn to be unfortunate. 
 He reflefted that the daemon of folly 
 was capricious -, and that as it had 
 fo long poffefTed the rulers and gene- 
 rals of Japan, it was high time it 
 fliould ihift its quarters, and occupy 
 the brains of the enemy; in which 
 cafe they would quit their advan- 
 tageous ports, and commit fome 
 blunder that would lay them at the 
 mercy of the Japonefe. — With re- 
 fpcd to the redudlion of Quib-quab, 
 he had heard, indeed, that the be- 
 Ikgers ought to be ten times, the 
 
 number 
 

<page 22>

 number of the garrlfon belieged ; 
 but as every Japonefc was equivalent 
 to ten fubjedts of China, he thought 
 the match v^as pretty equal. He re- 
 fiedled, that even if this expedition 
 fl^ould not fucceed, it v^^ould be of 
 little confequence to his reputation, 
 as he could plead at home, that he 
 neither conceived the original plan, 
 nor appointed any of the officers 
 concerned in the execution. It is 
 true, he might have reinforced the 
 army in Fatfifio, fo as to leave very 
 little to Fortune : but then he mufl 
 have fubftraded fomething from the 
 ftrength of the operations in Tar- 
 tary, which was now become the 
 favourite fcene of the war ; or he 
 mufl have altogether fufpended the 
 execution of another darling fcheme, 
 which was literally his own concep- 
 tion. There was an ifland in the 
 great Indian ocean, at a conliderable 
 diftance from Fatfilio ; and here the 
 
 Qiinefe 
 

<page 23>
14 T'los Uijlory and ' - 
 
 Chinefe had a flrong fettlement, 
 Taycho was inflamed with the am- 
 bition of reducing this ifland, which 
 was called Thin-quo 5 and for this 
 purpofe he refolved to embark abody 
 of forces which fliould co-operate 
 with the fquadron of Fune deftined 
 to cruize in thofe latitudes. — The 
 only difficulty that remained was to 
 choofe a general to dire<£t this enter- 
 prize. — He perufed a lift of all the 
 military officers in Japan; and as 
 they were all equal in point of repu- 
 tation, he began to examine their 
 names, in order to pitch upon that 
 "which fnould appear to be the moft 
 fignifieant: and in this particular,. 
 Taycho was a little fuperftitious. 
 Js^ot but that furnames, when pro- 
 perly beftowed, might be rendered 
 very ufeful terms of diftindion : 
 but I muft tell thee, Peacock, no- 
 thing can be more prepofteroufly 
 abfurd than the pradice of inheriting 
 
 cognominay 
 

<page 24>
j^dvent tires of an Atom, 15 
 
 cogrzcniraa, which ought ever to be 
 purely perfonal. I would aflc thee, 
 for example, what propriety there 
 was in. ^giving the name Xenophon, 
 which fignifies one that /peaks a fo- 
 reign language, to the celebrated 
 Greek: who diflinguifhed himfelf, 
 not only as a confummate captain,, 
 but alfo as an elegant writer in his 
 mother-tongue ? What could be 
 imore ridiculous than to deno- 
 minate the great philofopher of 
 Crotona PythagoraSy which implies 
 9i Jiinkmg fpeech ? Or what could 
 be more mifapplied than the name 
 of the weeping philofopher Hera- 
 elitusi^ {igm^y'm^ military glory ? The 
 inheritance of furnames, among the 
 Romans, produced flill more ludi- 
 crous confequences. The befl: and 
 nobleft families in Rome derived 
 their names from the coarfeft em- 
 ploy rnents, or elfe from the corpo- 
 real blehiifhes of their anceflors.

 The Pifones were millers : the Cice* 
 rones and the Lentuli were fo called 
 from the vetches and the lentils which 
 their forefathers dealt in* The Fabij 
 were fo denominated from a dung-pit, 
 in which the firft of the family was 
 begot by ftealth in the way of forni- 
 cation. A ploughman gave rife to 
 the great family of the Serrani, the 
 ladies of which always went without 
 fmocks. The Stiilliy the Bubulcty and 
 the Pord, were defcended from a 
 fwine-herd, a cow-herd, and a hog- 
 butcher. — What could be more dif- 
 graceful than to call the fenator 
 Strabo^ S quint urn y or a fine young 
 lady of the houfe of Pceti, Pigfnies S 
 or to diftinguifh a matron of the Li- 
 mi, by the appellation of Sheep's-^ 
 eye ? — What could be more difho- 
 nourable than to give the furname 
 of Sniib-nofe to P. Silius, the pro- 
 praetor, becaufe his great-great- 
 great-grand-father had a nofe of that

 narration. Taycho, having confider- 
 ed the lift of officers, without finding 
 one name which implied any adlive 
 virtue, refolved that the choice fhould 
 depend upon accident. He hurtled 
 them all together in his cap, and 
 putting in his hand at random, drew 
 forth that of Hob-nob ; a perfon who 
 had grown old in obfcurity, without 
 ever having found an opportunity of 
 being concerned in adlual fervicc. 
 His very name was utterly unknov/n 
 to Fika-kaka ; and this circumftance 
 the orator confidered as a lucky 
 omen; for the Cuboy had fuch a 
 remarkable knack at finding out the 
 Icaft qualified fubjedls, and overlook- 
 ing merit, his new coUegue concluded 
 (not without fome {hadow of reafon) 
 that Hob-nob's being unknown to 
 the prime minifter, was a fort of ne- 
 gative prefumption in favour of his 
 character. This officer was accord-

 The voyage was performed without 
 lofs : the troops were landed without 
 oppofition. They had already ad- 
 vanced towards arifing-ground which 
 commanded the principal town of 
 the ifland, and He-Rhumn had of- 
 fered to land and draw the artillery by 
 the mariners of his fquadron, when 
 Hob-nob had a dream which difcon- 
 certed all his meafures. He dream- 
 ed that he entertained all the ifland- 
 crs in the temple of the White Horfc; 
 and that his own grand-mother did 
 the honours of the table. — Indeed 
 he could not have performed a greater 
 ad: of charity -, for they were literal-

 Having confulted his interpreter on 
 this extraordinary dream, he was gi-' 
 ven to underftand that the omen was 
 unlucky; that if he perfifted in his 
 hoftihties, he himfelf would be taken 
 prifoner, and offered up as a facrifice 
 to the idol of the place. While he 
 ruminated on this unfavourable re- 
 fponfe, the principal inhabitants of 
 the ifland affembled, in order to de- 
 liberate upon their own deplorable 
 fituation. They had neither troop.*^, 
 arms, fortifications, nor provifion, 
 and defpaired of fupplies, as the 
 fleet of Japan furrounded the ifland. 
 In this emergency, they determined 
 to fubmit without oppofition i and_ 
 appointed a deputation to go and 
 make a tender of the ifland to ge- 
 neral Hob-nob. This deputation, 
 preceded by white flags of truce, the 
 Japonefe commander no fooner def- 
 cried, than he thought upon the in- 
 terpretation of his dream. He mif-

 imbarked, notwithftanding the ex- 
 hortations of He-Rhumn, and the 
 remonftrances of Rha-rin-tumm, 
 the fecond in command, who ufed 
 a number of arguments to dilTuade 
 him from his purpofe. The deputies 
 feeing the enemy in motion, made 
 a halt, and, after they were fair-* 
 ly on board, returned to the town, 
 iinging hymns in praife of the idol 
 Fo, who, they imagined, had con- 
 founded the underftanding of the Ja- 
 ponefe general. 
 
 The attempt upon Thin-quo hav- 
 ing thus mifcarried. Hob-nob declar- 
 ed he would return to Japan ; but 
 was with great difficulty perfuaded 
 by the commander of the Fune and 
 his own fecond, to make a defcent

 upon another ifland belonging to the 
 Chinefe, called ^la-chu, where they 
 aflured him he would meet with no 
 oppoiition. As he had no dream to 
 deter him from this attempt, he fuf- 
 fered himfelf to be perfuaded, and 
 aftually made good his landing : but 
 the horror occafioned by the appari- 
 tion of his grand-mother, had made 
 fuch an impreffion upon his mind, 
 as afFedled the conftitution of his 
 body. Before he was vifited by an- 
 other fuch vifion, he fickened and 
 died; and in confequence of his 
 death, Rha-rin-tumm and He-Rhumn 
 made a conqueft of the ifland of Qua- 
 X!huy which was much more valu- 
 able than Thin-quo, the firfl: and fole 
 objed of the expedition. — When the 
 firft news of this fecond defcent ar- 
 rived in Japan, the miniftry were 
 in the utmoft confufion. Mr. Orator

 man 'y fecondly, in attempting the 
 •conqueft of another place, which 
 was not fo much as mentioned in 
 his inftrudions. The truth is, the 
 importance of Qua-chu was not 
 known to the cabinet of Japan. 
 Fika-kaka believed it was fome place 
 on the continent of Tartary, and ex- 
 claimed in a violent paflion, " Rot 
 the block-head, Hob-nob ; he'll have 
 an army of Chinefe on his back in a 
 twinkling !" When the prefident 
 Soo-fan-fin~o affured him that Qua- 
 chu was a rich ifland at an immenfe 
 diftance from the continent of Tar- 
 tary, the Cuboy infixed upon kifling 
 his excellency's pofteriors for the 
 agreeable information he had recei- 
 ved. In a few weeks arrived the

 tidings of the ifland's being totally-

 Japan with every circumftance of ex- 
 aggeration. The blatant beafl: bray-

 great Taycho. Even the Cuboy ar- 
 rogated to himfelf fome fliare of 
 the honour gained by this expedi- 
 tion ; inafmuch as the general Rha-

 In the midft of all this feftivity, 
 the emperor Hill growled and grum- 
 bled about Yeffo. His new ally 
 Brut-an-tiffi had met with a variety 
 of fortune, and even fufFered fome 
 fhocks, which orator Taycho, with 
 all his art, could not keep from the 
 knowledge of the Dairo. — He had 
 been feverely drubbed by the Mant- 
 choux, who had advanced for that 
 purpofe even to his court-yard : but 
 this was nothing in comparifon to 
 another difafter, from which he had 
 a hair-breadth Tcape. The Great 
 Khan had employed one of his moft 
 wily and enterpriiing chiefs to feize 
 Brut-an-tiffi by furprize, that he 
 might be brought to juftice, and ex- 
 ecuted as a felon and perturbator of 
 the public peace. Kunt-than, who 
 was the partifan pitched upon for this 
 fervice^ pracflifed a thoufand flrata- 
 gems to decoy Brut-an-tiffi into a 
 carelefs fecurity ; but he was ftill

 baffled by the vigilance of Yam-a- 
 Kheit, a famous foldier of fortune, 
 who had engaged in the fervice of 
 the outlawed Tartar. At length the 
 opportunity offered, when this cap- 
 tain was fent out to lay the country 
 under contribution. ThenKunt-thaa 
 marching folely in the dead of night, 
 caught Brut-an-tiffi napping. He 
 might have flain him upon the fpot s 
 but his orders were to take him alive, 
 that he might be made a public ex- 
 ample; accordingly, his centinels be- 
 ing difpatched, he was pulled out of 
 bed, and his hands were already tied 
 with cords, like thofe of a common 
 malefador, when, by his roaring and 
 bellowing, he gave the alarm to Yam- 
 a-Kheit, who chanced to be in the 
 neighbourhood, returning from his 
 excurfion. — He made all the hafte 
 he could, and came up in the very 
 nick of time to fave his mafter. He 
 fell upon the party of Kunt-than 
 C 6 with 
 

<page 45>
36 l!he Hijlory and 
 
 with fuch fury, that they were fain 
 to quit their prey : then he cut the 
 fetters of Brut-an-tiffi, who took to 
 his heels and fled with incredible 
 expedition, leaving his preferver in 
 the midft of his enemies, by whom 
 he was overpowered, flruck from 
 his horfe, and trampled to death. 
 The grateful Tartar not only defert- 
 ed this brave captain in fuch extre- 
 mity, but he alfo took care to af- 
 perfe his memory, by infinuating that 
 Yam-a-Kheit had undertaken to 
 watch him while he took his repofe, 
 and had hirnfelf fallen afleep upon 
 his port, by which negledt of duty 
 the Oftrog had been enabled to pe- 
 netrate into his quarters. 'Tis an 
 ill w^ind that blows no-body good : 
 — the fame difafter that deprived 
 him of agoodofScer, afforded him an

 the charge of mifcondud: for the at- 
 tack of T a, by accufing his 
 
 engineer, who, having fallen in the 
 battle, could not contradid: his af- 
 fertion. In regard to the affair with 
 the Mantchoux, Brut-an-tiffi was 
 refolved to fwear truth out of Tar- 
 tary by meer dint of impudence. In 
 the very article of running away, 
 he began to propagate the report of 
 the great vidtory he had obtained. 
 He fent the Dairo a circumftantial 
 detail of his own prowefs, and ex- 
 patiated upon the cowardice of the 
 Mantchoux, who he faid had vaniih- 
 ed from him like quick-filver, at the 
 very time when they were quietly 
 poileffed of the field of battle, and he 
 himfelf was calling upon the moun- 
 tains to cover him. It muft have 
 been in imitation of this great origi- 
 nal, that the Infpeftor, of tympani-

 one of his lucubrations, that a cer- 
 tain tall Hibernian was afraid of 
 looking him in the face ; becaufe 
 the faid poltroon had kicked his 
 breech the night before in prefence 
 of five hundred people. 
 
 Fortune had now abandoned the 
 Chiiiefe in good earneft. Two 
 fquadrons of their Fune had been 
 fucceffively taken, deftroyed, or dif- 
 perfed, by the Japonefe commanders 
 Or-nbos and Faf-khan ; and they 
 had loft fuch a number of fingle 
 junks, that they were fcarce able to 
 keep the fea. On the coaft of Africa 
 they were driven from the fettle- 
 ment of Kho-rhe, by the com- 
 mander Kha-fell. In the extremity 
 of Afia, they had an army totally 
 defeated by the Japonefe captain 
 Khutt-whang, and many of their 
 fettlements were taken. In Fat- 
 fifio, they loft another battle to 
 
 Yan-oni,

 Yan-oni, and divers ftrong holds. 
 In the neighbourhood of Yeflb, Bron- 
 xi-tic, who commanded the merce- 
 nary army of Japan on that conti- 
 nent, had been obh'ged to retreat 
 before the Chinefe from poft to pil- 
 lar, till at length he found it abfo- 
 lutely neceffary to maintain his po- 
 sition, even at the rifque of being at- 
 tacked by the enemy, that outnum- 
 bered him greatly. He chofe an 
 advantageous poft, where he thought 
 himfelf fecure, and went to fleep 
 at his ufual time of reft. The Chi- 
 nefe general refolving to beat up his 
 quarters in the night, feledled a 
 body of horfe for that purpofe, and 
 put them in motion accordingly. It 
 was happy for Bron-rxi-tic that this 
 detachment fell upon a quarter where 
 there happened to be a kennel of 
 Japonefe dogs, which are as famous 
 as the bull-dogs of England. Thefe

 bring up his troops to ad: ion. All 
 that he faw of the battle, when he 
 came up, was a fmall number of 
 killed and wounded, and the cavalry 
 of the enemy fcampering off in con- 
 fufion, tho' at a great diftance from 
 the field. No matter; — he found 
 means to paint this famous battle of 
 
 - Myn-than in fuch colours as dazzled 
 the weak eye-fight of the Japonefe 
 monfter, which bellov/ed hoarfe ap- 
 plaufe through all its throats 3 and 
 in its hymns of triumph equalled 
 Bron-xi-tic even to the unconquer- 
 able Brut-an-tiffi, which laft, about 
 this time, received at his own door 
 another beating from the Mant-

 life ; and, indeed, owed his fafety to 
 a very extraordinary circumftance. 
 An Oftrog chief called Llha-dahn, 
 who had reinforced the Mantchoux 
 with a very confiderable body of 
 horfe before the battle, inlifted up- 
 on carrying off the carcafe of Brut- 
 an-tiffi, that it might be hung up on 
 agibbet in terrorern, before the pa- 
 vilion of the great Khan. The 
 general of the Mantchoux, on the 
 other hand, declared he would have 
 •it flayed upon the fpot, and the flcin 
 fent as a trophy to his fovereign. 
 This difpute produced a great deal 
 of abufe betwixt thofe barbarians j 
 and it was with great difficulty fome 
 of their inferior chiefs, who were 
 wifer than themfelves, prevented 
 them from going by the ears to- 
 gether. In a word, the confu- 
 fion and anarchy that en fued, afford- 
 ed an opportunity to one of Brut- 
 an-tiffi's partifans to ileal away the 
 
 body

 was gone, rode ofF in difguft with 
 all his cavalry ; and the Mantchoux, 
 inftead of following the blow, made a 
 retrograde motion towards their own 
 country, which allowed Brut-an-tiffi 
 time to breathe. Three fucceffive 
 difaflers of this kind would have 
 been fufficient to lower the military 
 character of any warrior, in the opi- 
 nion of any public that judged from 
 their own fenfes and reflexion : but, 
 by this time, the Japonefe had quiet- 
 ly refigned all their natural percep- 
 tions, and paid the moft implicit 
 faith to every article broached by 
 their apoftle Taycho. The more 
 it feemed to contradidl common rea- 
 fon and common evidence, the more 
 greedily was it fw allowed as a myf- 
 terious dogma of the political creed, 
 Taycho then alTured them that the

 whole army of the Mantchoux was 
 put to the fword ; and that Bron- 
 xi-tic would carry the war within 
 three weeks, into the heart of Chi- 
 na ; he gave them goblets of horfe- 
 blood from Myn-than^ and tickled 
 their ears and their nofes : they 
 fnorted approbation, licked his toes, 
 and funk into a profound lethargy. 
 From this, however, they were foon 
 arroufed by unwelcome tidings from 
 Fatfilio. YafF-rai had proceeded in 
 his route until he was flopped by a 
 vaft lake, which be could not pof- 
 fibly traverfe without boats, cork- 
 jackets, or fome fuch expedient, 
 which could not be fupplied for that 
 campaign. Ya-loff had failed up 
 the river to Quib-quab, which he 
 found fo ftrongly fortified by nature, 
 that it feemed rafhnefs even to at- 
 tempt a landing, efpeciallyin the face 
 of an enemy more numerous than his

 he did, and even attacked a forti- 
 fied camp of the Chinefcj but, in 
 fpite of all his efforts, he was repul- 
 fed with confiderable lliiughter. He 
 fent an account of this mifcarriage 
 to Taycho, giving him to underfland, 
 at the fame time, that he had receiv- 
 ed no intelligence of Yaff-rai's mo- 
 .tions \ that his troops were greatly 
 -diminiflied ; that the feafon was too 
 -far advanced to, keep the field much 
 -longer; and that nothing was left them 
 but a choice of difficulties, every one 
 of which feemed more infurmount- 
 able than another. Taycho having 
 deliberated on this fubjed:, thought 
 it was necefiTary to prepare the mon- 
 fter for the worft that could hap- 
 pen, as he now expedled to hear 
 .by the firft opportunity, that the 
 grand expedition of Fatfiiio had to-

 he had given, nor refolution to exe- 
 cute the plan he had projed:ed. For 
 this purpofe he afcended the rof- 
 trum, and with a rueful length of 
 face opened his harangue upon the 
 defeat of Ya-loff. The Hydra no 
 fooner underftood that the troops of 
 Japan had been difcomfited, than it 
 was feized with a kind of hyfleric 
 fit, and uttered a yeil fo loud and 
 horrible, that the blind-fold Dairo 
 trembled in the moft internal receffes 
 of his palace : the Cuboy Fika-kaka 
 had fuch a profufe evacuation, that 
 the difcharge is faid to have weighed 
 five BoU-ah, equal to eight and fui ty

 arrived, preceded by twelve poftilions 
 blowing horns ; and he brought the 
 news that Quib-quab was taken. 
 The orator commanded them to place 
 their horns within as many of the 
 monfter's long ears, and blow with all 
 their might, until it fhould exhibit 
 fome figns of hearing. The experi- 
 ment fucceeded. The Hydra waking 
 from its trance, opened its eyes; and 
 Taycho feizing this opportunity, 
 hollowed in his loudeft tone, «* Quib-

 peated, the beaft flarted up ; then,

 The apoftle Bupo was no longer in-

 fell was a ftranger to orator Taycho :

 dogs had been colleded at random 
 from thefhambles cfjMeaco : he had 
 never heard of Yan-o-ni's name, till 
 h€ diftinguiflied himfelf by his firft

 been Sey-feo-guns in conftant em-

 owed his promotion to the intereft

 alledged, that Taycho projeded in

 he niutilated and frittered the origi- 
 nal fcheme of the campaign in Fat-

 of Fortune. TheredudionofKho-rhe 
 was part of the defign formed by the 
 Banyan Thum-khumm-qua, which 
 Taychodidall that lay in his power to 
 render abortive. The plan of operati- 
 ons in the extremity of Tartary, he did 
 not pretend to meddle with;- — ^it was 
 the concern of the officers appointed by 
 the trading company there fettled : 
 and as to the advantages obtained at 
 fea, they naturally refulted from the 
 difpofition of cruifes, made and regu- 
 lated by the board of Sey-feo-gun- 
 fealty, with which no minifter ever 
 interfered. He might, indeed, have 
 recalled the chiefs and officers whom 
 he found already appointed when he;

 his own choofing. How far he was 
 qualified to make fuch a choice, and 
 plan new expeditions, appears from 
 the adventures of the generals he 
 did appoint; Moria-tanti, who was 
 deterred from landing by a perfpec- 
 tive view of whiilcers ; HyUb-bib, 
 who left his rear in the lurch ; and 
 Hob-nob, who made fuch a mafter- 
 ]y retreat from the fappofed Bonzas 
 of Thin-quo. — -Thefe three were li- 
 terally commanders of his own crea- 
 tion, employed in executing fchemes 
 of his own projeding \ and thefe 
 three were the only generals he made, 
 and the only military plans he pro-* 
 jecfted, if we except the grand fcheme 
 of fubfidizin?Brut-an-tiffi, and form- 
 ing an army of one hundred thoufand 
 men inTartary, for the defence of the 
 farm ofYeflo. — Thin^^s bein^ io cir- 
 cumftanced, it may be eafilv conceiv- 
 ed that the Orator could alt nothing 
 which the Mobile would venture to

 ence to the utmofl flretch ; he milk- 
 ed the dugs of the monfter till the 
 blood came. For the fervice of the 
 enfuing year, he fqueezed from them 
 near twelve millions ofobans, am.ount- 
 ing to near tv/enty-four millions fter- 
 ling, about four times as much as 
 had ever been raifed by the empire 
 of Japan in any former war. But, by 
 this time, Taycho was become not 
 only a convert to the fyftem of 
 Tartary, which he had formerly per- 
 fecuted, but alfo an enthufiaft in love 
 and admiration of Brut-an-tiffi, 
 who had lately fent him his poetical 
 works in a prefent. This, however, 
 would have been of no ufe, as he 
 could not read them, had not he difco- 
 vered they were printed on a very 
 fine,foft, fmooth Chinefe paper made 
 of filk, which he happily converted 
 to another fundamental purpofe. In

 ment which Horace defcribes ; Tibia

 tice, Peacock, this was the only pre- 
 fent Taycho ever beftowed on any 
 man, woman, or child, through the 
 whole courfe of his life, I mean out 
 of his own pocket; for he was ex- 
 tremely liberal of the public money, 
 in his fubfidies to the Tartar chiefs, 
 and in the profecution of the war 
 upon that continent. The Orator was 
 a genius felf- taught without the help 
 of human inflitution. He afteded 
 to undervalue all men of lite- 
 rary talents ; and the only book he 
 ever read with any degree of plea- 
 fure, was a colledion of rhapfodies 
 preached by one Ab-ren-thi, an ob- 
 fture fanatic Bonza, a native of the

 Notwithftnndin^ all his efforts in 
 behalf of the Tartarian fcheme, the 
 Chinefe ftill lingered on the frontiers 
 of Yeffo. The views of the court 
 of Pekin exactly coincided with the 
 intereft of Bron-xi-tic, the mercenary 
 general of Japan. The Chinefe, con- 
 founded at the unheard-of fuccefs of 
 the Japonefe in Fatfifio and other 
 parts of the globe, and extremely 
 mortified at the deftrudtion of their 
 fleets and the ruin of their com- 
 merce, faw no other way of diftref- 
 fing the enemy, but that of prolong- 
 in o; the wsr on the continent of Tar- 
 tary, which they could fupport for 
 little more than their ordinary ex- 
 pence; whereas Japan could not main- 
 tain it without contracting yearly im- 
 
 menfe

 mtx\{Q loads of debt^ which muft have 
 cruflied it at the long-run. It was the 
 bufinefs of the Chinefe, therefore, 
 not to finifli the war in Tartary by 
 taking the farm of Yeffo, becaufe, in. 
 that cafe, the annual expence of it 
 would have been faved to Japan \ but 
 to keep it alive by forced marches^ 
 predatory excurfions, and undecifive 
 adlions ; and this was precifely the 
 intereft of general Bron-xi-tic, who- 
 in the continuance of the war en- 
 joyed the continuance of all his emo- 
 luments. All that he had lo do, 
 then, was to furnifli Taycho from 
 time to time with a ca/k of humaji 
 blood, for the entertainment of the 
 blatant beair 5 and to fend over afew 
 horfc-tails, as trophies of pretended 
 vidories, to be waved before the 
 monfler in its holiday proceffions. 
 He and the Chinefe general feem.ed 
 to ad: in concert. They advanced 
 and retreated in their turns betwixt

6o T^he Hijiory and 
 
 two given lines, and the campaign al- 
 ways ended on the fame fpot where 
 it began. The only difference be- 
 tween them was in the motives of their 
 condudl ; the Chinefe commander 
 aded for the benefit of his fovereign, 
 and Bron-xi-tic adled for his own. 
 
 The continual danger to which the 
 farm of YeiTo was expofed, pro- 
 duced fuch apprehenfions and cha- 
 grin in the mind of the Dairo Got- 
 bama-baba, that his health began to 
 decline. He negkded his food and 
 his rattle, and no longer took any 
 pleafure in kicking the Cuboy. 
 He frequently muttered ejaculations 
 about the farm of Yeffo : nay, once 
 or twice in the tranfports of his im- 
 patience, he pulled the bandage from 
 his eyes, and curfed Taycho in the 
 Tartarian language. At length he 
 fell into a lethargy, and even when 
 roufed a little by bliflers and cauf- 
 tics, feemed infcnfible of every thing 
 
 that

 that was done about him* Thefe 
 bliilers were raifed by burning the 
 inoxa upon his fcalp. The powder 
 of luenokt was alio injedted in a 
 glyfter j and the operation of acu- 
 puDvflure, called Senkei, performed 
 without effed.. His diforder was fo 
 ftubborn, that the Cuboy began to 
 think he was bewitched> and fuf- 
 peded Taycho of having pradlifed 
 forcery on his fovereign. He com- 
 municated this fufpicion to Mura- 
 clami, who fhook his head, and ad- 
 vifed that, with the Orator's good 
 leave, the council fhould be canfult- 
 ed. Taycho, who had gained an ab- 
 folute empire over the mind of the 
 Dairo, and could not forefee how his 
 intereft might ftand with his fuccef- 
 for, was heartily difpofed to concur 
 in any feafible experiment for the 
 recovery of Got-hama-baba : he 
 therefore confented that the "mouths 
 of the council inould be unpadlock-

 affembled without delay; with this ex- 
 prefs provifo, however, that they were 
 to confine their deliberations to the 
 fubjedt of theDairoandhis diftemper. 
 By this time the phyficians had dif- 
 covered the caufe of the difordcr, 
 which was no other than his being 
 Hung by a poifonous infedt produced 
 in the land of YeiTo, analogous to 
 the tarantula, which is faid to do 
 fo much mifchief in fome parts of 
 Apuglia, as we are told by /Elian, 
 Epiphanius Ferdinandus, andBaglivi. 
 In both cafes the only efFedual reme- 
 dy was mufic ; and now'the council 
 was called to determine what fort of 
 mufic (liould be adminiflered. You 
 mud know, Peacock, the Japonefe 
 are but indnTerently fkilled in this 
 art, tho', in general, they affedl to be 
 connoilTeurs. They are utterly igno- 
 rant of the theory, and in the prac- 
 tice are excelled by all their neigh-

 my owa part, I fludied mufic under 
 Pythagoras at Crotona. He found 
 the fcale of i^^^n tones imperfed:, 
 and added the odlave as a fixed, fen- 
 fible, and intelligent terniination of 
 an interval, v/hich included every 
 poffible divifion, and determined all 
 the relative differences of founds : 
 befides, he taught us how to exprefs 
 th€ odave by f, &c. &c. But 
 v^hy Hiould I talk to thee of the an- 
 tient digram ma, the genera, &c. of 
 muiic, which with their colour?, 
 were conftruded by a divifion of the 
 diateffaron. Thou art too dull and 
 ignorant to comprehend the chro- 
 matic fpecies, the conflruftion of the 
 tetrachord, the Phrygian, the Ly- 
 dian, and other modes of the antient 
 mufic : and for diftindtion of ear,

 exhilarates thyfpirits fo much as a fo- 
 nata on the falt-box, or a concert of 
 marrow-bones and cleavers. The ears 
 cf the Japonefe were much of the fame 
 texture^ and their mufic was fuited 
 to their ears. They neither excelled 
 in the melopceia, and rythm or ca- 
 dence j nor did they know any thing 
 cf the true fcience of harmony, com- 
 pofitions in parts, and thofe combi- 
 nations of founds, the invention of 
 which, with the improvement of the 
 fcale, is erroneoully afcribed to a Be- 
 nedidine monk. The truth is, the

 fame apartment where the Dairo 
 lay ; and a:s the bufinefs was to de- 
 termine what kind of mufie was moft 
 likely to make an impreffion upon 
 his organs, every member came pro- 
 vided with his expedient. Firft and 
 foremoft, Mr. Orator Taycho pro- 
 nounced an oration upon the excel- 
 lences of the land of YefTo, of eaer- 
 gy (as the Cuboy faid) fufficient to 
 draw the moon from her fpherej 
 it drew nothing, however, from the 
 patient but a fingle groan : then the 
 Fatzman caufed a drum to beat> 
 without producing any effedt at all 
 upon the Dairo ; tho* it deprived the 
 whole council of their hearing for 
 fome time. The third effay was 
 made by Fika-kaka ; firfl with a rat- 
 tle, and then with tongs and grid- 
 iron, which lad was his favourite 
 mufic ', but here it failed, to his great 
 furprize and confternation. Sti- 
 phi-rum-poo brought thecrier of his 
 
 court

 court to promulgate a decree again ft 
 "Yeflb, in a voice that is wont to make 
 the culprit tremble ; but the Dairo 
 was found Ignoramus. Nin-com- 
 poo-po blew a blail with a kind of 
 boatlwain's whiille, which difcom- 
 pofed the v/hole audience without af- 
 feding the emperor. Fokh--fi— 
 rokhu faid he would try his im- 
 perial majefty with a found which 
 be had always been known to pre- 
 fer to every other fpecies of mufic ; 
 and pulling out a huge purfe of 
 golden obans, began to chink them 
 in his ear. — This experiment fo 
 far fuccecded, that the Dairo was 
 perceived to fmile, and even to con- 
 trad one hand : but further effcd 
 it had none. AtlaftGotto-mioftart- 
 ing up, threw a fm.all quantity of 
 aiirum fulnmians into the fire, which

 baba ftarted upright in his bed. 
 This, however, was no more than a 
 convuliion that put an end to his 
 life ; for he fell back again, and ex- 
 pired in the twinkling of an eye. — 
 As for the Cuboy, tho' he did not 
 die, he underwent afurprifmg tranf- 
 formation or metamorphofis, which 
 I fl^iall record in due feafon. 
 
 Taycho was no fooner certified 
 that Got-harna-baba had actnally 
 breathed his laft, than he vanidied 
 from the council in the twinkling 
 of an eye, and mounting the beaft 
 whofe name is Legion, rode full fpeed 
 to the habitation of Gw-gio, the fuc- 
 ceffor and defcendant of the deceafcd 
 Dairo. — Gio-gio was a young 
 prince who had been induflrioufly 
 fequeftered from the public view, 
 and excluded from all iliare in the 
 affairs of ftate by the jealaufy of the 
 
 laft

 laft emperor. — He lived retired un- 
 der the wings of his grand-mother, 
 and had divers preceptors to teach 
 him the rudiments of every art but 
 the art of reigning. Of all thofe who 
 fuperintended his education, he who 
 infinuated himfelf the fartheft in his 
 favour, was one Tak-Jlrot^ from the 
 mountains of Ximo, who valuedhim- 
 felf much upon the antient blood 
 that ran in his veins, and ftill more 
 upon his elevated ideas of patriot- 
 ifm. Yak-ftrot was honefl: at bot- 
 tom, but proud, referved, vain, and 
 afFeded. He had a turn for nick- 
 nacks and gim-cracks, and once 
 made and mounted an iron jack 
 and a wooden clock with his own 
 hands. But it was his misfortune 
 to fet up for a connoifleur in paint- 
 ing and other liberal arts, and to an- 
 nounce himfelf an univerfal patron 
 of genius. He did not fail to infufe 
 
 his

 his own notions and conceits into the 
 tender mind of Gio-gio, who gradu- 
 ally imbibed his turn of thinking, 
 and followed the iliidies which he 
 recommended. — With refped: to his 
 lelibns on the art of government^ 
 he reduced them to a very few fim- 
 ple principles.-— His maxims were 
 thefe : That the emperor of Japan 
 ought to cherifli the eftablifhed re- 
 L'gicn, both by precept and exam- 
 ple ; that he ought to abolifli cor- 
 ruption, difcourage faction, and 
 balance the two parties by admitting 
 an equal number from each, to places 
 and offices of truft in the adminiftra- 
 tion : that he (hould make peace as 
 foon as poffible, even in defoite of 
 the public, which feemed infenfible 
 of the burthen it fuftained, and was 
 indeed growing delirious by the il- 
 lufions of Taycho, and the cruel eva- 
 cuations he had prefcribed : that he 
 Ibould retrench all fuperfluous ex- 
 
 pencc 
 

<page 79>

 penqe in his hoafliold and govern- 
 ment, and detach himfelfintirely from 
 theaccarfcd farm of "Peffo, which fome 
 evil genius had fixed upon the breech 
 of Japan, as a cancerous ulcer thro' 
 which all her blood and fubftance 
 would be difcharged. Thefe maxims 
 were generally jud enough in fpecu-* 
 lation, but fonie of them were alto- 
 gether impradlicable ;-— for example, 
 that of forming an adminiftration 
 equally compofed of the two fac- 
 tions, was as abfurd as it would be 
 to yoke two ftone-horfes and two 
 jack-aiTes in the fame carriage, which, 
 inftead of drawino; one way, would 
 do nothing but bite and kick one 
 another, while the machine of ?0'^ 
 vernment would ftand ftock-ftill, or 
 perhaps be torn in pieces by their 
 dragging in oppofite diredlions.— 
 The people of Japan had been long 
 divided between two inveterate par- 
 ties known by the names oi Shk-tilk^

 Each had jDredominated in its turn, 
 by fecuring a majority in the affem- 
 blies of the people , for the majori- 
 ty. had always interefl to force them- 
 felves into the adminiilration ; be- 
 caufe the conftitution being partly 
 democratic, the Dairo was flill 
 obliged to truckle to the prevailing 
 fadion. — -To obtain this majority, 
 each fide had employed every art of 
 corruption, calumny, infinuation, 
 and prieft-craft i for nothinir is 
 luch an effedual ferment in all po- 
 pular commotions as religious fana- 
 ticifm. — -No fooner one party ac* 
 compliflied its aim than it repro- 
 bated the other, branding it with 
 the epithets of traitors to their 
 country, or traitors to their prince 5 
 while the minority retorted upon

 fliort, both parties were equally abu- 
 five, rancorous, uncandid, and illi- 
 beral. Taycho had been of both 
 fadlions more than once. — He made 
 his firft appearance as a Shi-tilk-iimf" 
 heit in the minority, and difplayed 
 , his talent for fcurrility againft the 
 Dairo to fuch advantage, that an 
 old rich hag, who loved nothing 
 {o well as money, except the gra- 
 tification of her revenge, made him 
 a prefent of five thoufand obans, 
 on condition he fliould continue to 
 revile the Dairo till his dying- 
 dny. — After her death, the minif- 
 try, intimidated by the boldnefs of 
 his tropes, and the fame he be- 
 gan to acquire as a mal- content 
 orator, made him fuch offers as he 
 thought proper to accept ; and 
 then he turned She-it-kumf-ki-tiL

 head of his old friends the Shi-tilk^

 ferted them to rule the roaft, as chief 
 of the She-it-kumf-hi'tUites i in which 
 predicament he now flood. And, in-

 ture in which he could flandj for 
 this party embraced all the fcum of 
 the people, conftituting the blatant

 peculiarly adapted to manage and go^

 of Yak-ftrot, was the abolition of 
 corruption, the ordure of which is 
 as neceffary to anoint the wheels of 
 government in Japan, as greafe is to 
 fmear the axle-tree of a 'loaded wag-

 hail yourfucceflionto the throne, and 
 cry aloud, Long live the ever-glorious

 of Japan." To this falutation the 
 bead below brayed hoarfe applaufe ; 
 and all prefent kiflfed the hand of the 
 new emperor, who, kneeling before 
 ills venerable grandame, craved her 
 feleffing, deiiring the benejfit of her 
 prayers, that God would make him 
 a good kin?, and eftablifh his throne 
 in righteoufnefs. Then he afcended

 Thefirft ftephe took after his eleva- 
 tion, was to publifii a decree, or rather 
 exhortation, to honour religion and 
 the Bonzes ; and this was no impolitic ' 
 expedient : for it firmly attached that 
 numerous and powerful tribe to his 
 intereft. His next meafures did not 
 feem to be direfted by the fame fpi- 
 rit of difcretion. He admitted a 
 parcel of raw boys, and even fome 
 individuals of the faction of Shi-tilk- 
 wnf'heit into his council ; and though 
 Taychoftill continued to manage the 
 reins of adminiflration, Yak-ftrot was 
 aflbciated with him in office, to the 
 great fcandal and diflatisfacftion of 
 the Niphonites,who hate all the Xi- 
 mians with a mixture of jealouiy and 
 contempt.

 he prefented himfelf in his ufual at- 
 titude, he had not received the kick 
 of approbation. New reigns, new 
 cuftoms : This Dairo never dreamed 
 of kicking thofe whom he deh'ghted 
 to honour. — It was a fecret of ftate 
 which had not yet come to his 
 knowledge ; and Yak-£lrot had al- 
 ways afllired him, that kicking the 
 breech always and every-where im- 
 plied difgrace, as kicking the parts 
 before, betokens ungovernable paffion. 
 Yak-flrot, however, in this particu- 
 lar, feems to have been too confined 
 in his notions of the etiquette : for 
 it had been the cuftom time imme- 
 morial for theDairos of Japan to kick 
 their favourites and prime minifters. 
 Befides, there are at this day diffe- 
 rent forts of kicks ufed even in Eng- 
 land, without occaiioning any difiio- 
 nour to the Kickee, — It is fome- 
 times a misfortune to be kicked out 
 of place, but no dishonour. A man

 ferment, in order that his place may- 
 be given to a perfon of more intereft. 
 Then there is the amorous kick, 
 called Kick 'urn, Jenny^ which every 
 gallant undergoes with pleafure : 
 hence the old Englifh appellation oi 
 Kickjy-^ivickfy^ beftowed on a wanton 
 leman who knew all her paces. As 
 for the familiar kick, it is no other 
 than a mark of friendlliip : nor is it 
 more dishonourable to be cuffed and 
 cudgelled. Every body knows thaf 
 the ahpa or box o' the ear, among 
 the Romans, was a particular mark 
 of favour by which their flaves were 
 made free ; and the favourite gla- 
 diator, when he obtained his difmif- 
 iion from the fervice, was honoured 
 with a found cudgelling -, this being 
 the true meaning of the phrafe rude 
 donatus. In the times of chivalry,

 The Parafchiftes, who pra<5tifed r/;;-

 always feverely drubbed after the

 the patriarch of the Greeks once a 
 year, on Eafter-eve, when he carries 
 out the facred fire from the holy fe- 
 pulchre of Jerufalem, is heartily 
 cudgelled by the infidek, a certain 
 number of whom he hires for that

 but when you fmite them on one

 tes thought it no difgrace to be kick-

 faid to have undergone the fame dif- 
 cipline from other people, without 
 making the leaft refiftance, it being 
 his opinion that it was more coura-

 to bear a drubbing patiently, than to 
 attempt any thing eitherin the way 
 of felf-defence or retaliation. — The

 his hook De Jure Gentium & Naturalr, 
 declares, that a man's honour is not 
 fo fragile as to be hurt either by a box 
 on the ear, or a kick on the breech, 
 otherwife it would be in the power 
 of every faucy fellow to diminifh or 
 infringe it. — It muft be owned, in- 
 deed, Grotius De Jure Belli & Pads, 
 fays, that charity does not of itfelf 
 require our patiently fuffering fuch 
 an affront. The Englifh have with 
 a moft fervile imitation, borrowed 
 their pimto, as well as other modes, 
 from the French nation. Now kick- 
 ing and cuffing were counted infa- 
 mous among thoie people for thefe 
 reafons. A box on the ear deftroys 
 the whole oecanomy of \\\€\x frtfure^ 
 upon which they beftow the greateft 
 part of their time and attention ; and 
 a kick on the breech is attended with 
 great pain and danger, as they are 
 generally fubje^t to the piles. This 
 is fo truly the cafe, that they have

 who was a native of the kingdom of 
 Ireland. He prefides over the blind 
 piles. The other is a female faint, Hce- 
 morrhoijjay and fhe comforts thofe who 
 are diftreiled with the bleeding piles. 
 No wonder, therefore, that a French- 
 man put to the torture by a kick on 
 thofe tender parts, fhould be pro- 
 voked to vengeance; and that this 
 vengeance fliould gradually become 
 an article in their fyfiem of puncSlilio, 
 But, to return to the thread of my 
 narration. — Whatever inclination 
 the Dairo and Yak-ftrot had to re- 
 (lore the bleffings of peace, they did 
 not think proper as yet to combat 
 the difpofition and fchemes of Ora- 
 tor Taycho; in confequence of whofe 
 remonflrances, the tributary treaty 
 was immediately renewed with Brut- 
 an-tij8i, and Gio-gio declared in the 
 
 aflembly 
 

<page 92>
Adventures of an Atom. 83 
 
 aflembly of the people, that he was 
 determined to fupport that ilhiftrious 
 ally, and carry on the war with vi- 
 gour. — By this time the Chinefe 
 were in a manner expelled from their 
 chief fettlements in Fatfifio, where 
 they now retained nothing but an 
 inconfiderable colony, which would 
 have fubmltted on the firft fum- 
 mons : but this Taycho left as a 
 neft-egg to produce a new brood of 
 difturbance to the Japonefe fettle- 
 ments, that they might not raft with 
 too much peace and fecurity. To 
 be plain v/ith you. Peacock, his 
 thoughts were entirely alienated from 
 thisFatfifian war, in which the intereft 
 of his country was chiefly concerned, 
 and cpnverted wholly to the conti* 
 nent of Tartary^ where all his cares 
 centered in fchemes for the fuccefs of 
 his friend Brut-an-tiffi. This free- 
 booter had lately undergone ftrange 
 viciflitudes of fortune. He had feeii 
 E 6 his 
 

<page 93>
84 ^he Hijiory and 
 
 his chief village poffelTed and plun- 
 dered by the enemy j but he found, 
 means, by furprize, to beat up their 
 quarters in the beginning of winter, 
 which always proved his befl ally, 
 becaufe then the Mantchoux Tar^ 
 tars were obliged to retire to their 
 own country, at a vaft diftance from 
 the feat of the war. — As for Bron-xi- 
 tic, who commanded the Japonefe ar- 
 my on that continent, he continued 
 to play booty with the Chinefe ge- 
 neral, over whom he was allowed to 
 obtain fome petty advantages, which> 
 with the trophies won by Brut-an-^ 
 tiffi, were fwelled up into mighty 
 victories, to increafe the infatua- 
 tion of the blatant beaft. — On the 
 other hand, Bron-xi-tic obliged the 
 generals of China with the like indul- 
 gences, by now and then facrificing 
 a detachment of his Japonefe troops, 
 to keep up the fpirits of that nation. 
 Taycho had levied upon the peopk 
 
 of 
 

<page 94>
Adventures of an Atom. 85 
 
 of Japan an immenfe fum of money 
 for the equipment of a naval arma- 
 ment, the deftination of which was 
 kept a profound fecret. Some politi- 
 cians imagined it was defigned for 
 the conquefl of Thin-quo, and all the 
 other fettlements which the Chinefe 
 poffeffed in the Indian ocean: others 
 conjed:ured the intention was to at- 
 tack the king of Corea, who had, 
 fmce the beginning of this war, 
 adled with a fhameful partiality in 
 favour of the emperor of China, his 
 kinfman and ally. But the truth of 
 the matter was this : Taycho kept 
 the armament in the harbours of Ja- 
 pan ready for a defcent upon the 
 coaft of China, in order to make a 
 diverfion in favour of his friend 
 Brut-an-tiffi, in cafe he had run any 
 rifque of being oppreffed by his ene- 
 mies. However, the beaft of many

 was all the monfter had for its ten 
 minions of Obans. 
 
 While Taycho amufed the Mobile 
 with this winter expedition. Yak- ftrot 
 refolved to plan the fcheme of oecono- 
 my which he had projected. He dif- 
 mifled from theDairo's fervice about a 
 dozen of cooks andfcuUions -, fhut up

 a few days there was no fmoke Teen 
 to afcend from the kitchens of the 
 palace ; nor did any fuel, torch, or 
 taper blaze in the chimnies, courts, 
 and apartments thereof, which now 
 became the habitation of cold, dark- 
 nefs, and hunger. Gio-gio himfelf, 
 who turned peripatetic philofooher 
 merely to keep himfelf in heat, fell 
 into a wa{h-tub as he groped his way 
 in the dark through one of the lower 
 galleries. Two of his body-guard 
 had their whifkers gnawed off by 
 the rats, as they flept in his anti- 
 chamber ', and their captain prefent- 
 ed a petition declaring, that neither 
 he nor his men could undertake the 
 defence of his imperial majefty's per- 
 fon, unlefs their former allowance of 
 provilion fhould be reftored. They 
 and all the individuals of the houfe- 
 hold were not only punished in their 
 bellies, but likewife curtailed in their 
 clothing, and abridged in their fti- 
 
 pends.

 ufed to be the temple of mirth, jol-

 wag fixed up a ticket on the outward 
 gate with this infcription : ** This 
 tenement to be lett, the proprietor 
 having left off houfe-keeping." 
 
 Yak-ftrot, hov/ever, was refolved 
 to fhew, that if the new Dairo re- 
 trenched the fuperfluities of his do- 
 meftic expence, he did not a<ft from 
 avarice or poornefs of fpirit, inaf- 
 much as he (hould now difplay his 
 liberality in patronizing genius and 
 the arts. A general jubilee was nov/ 
 promifed to all thofe who had diflin- 
 guifhed themfelves by their talentsor 
 erudition. The emiflaries of Yak- 
 ftrot declared that Mscenas was but 
 a type of this Ximian mountaineer ; 
 and that he was determined to fearch 
 for merit, even in the thickeft ihades 
 of obfcurity. All thefe refearcheg,

 however, proved fo unfuccefsful, that 
 not above four or five men of ge- 
 nius could be found in the whole 
 empire of Japan, and thefe were 
 gratified with penfions of about one 
 hundred Obans each. One was a fe- 
 cularized Bonza from Ximo; another 
 a malcontent poet of Niphon ; a 
 third, a reformed comedian of Xi- 
 coco ; a fourth, an empiric, who had 
 outlived his practice ; and a fifth, a 
 decayed apothecary, who was bard, 
 quack, author, chymift, philofopher, 
 and fimpler by profeffion. The whole 
 of the expence arifing from the fa- 
 vour and protection granted 'by the 
 Dalro to thefe men of genius, did 
 not exceed kv^vi or eigh: hundred 
 
 Obansper annum, amounting to about 
 fifteen hundred pounds flerlino- • 
 whereas many a private Quo in Ja- 
 pan expended more money on a ken- 
 nel of hounds. I do not mention 
 thofe men of fmgular merit, whom

 laries were included in the ordinary 
 expence of the crown : I ihall only 
 obferve, that a certain perfon who 
 could not read, v/as appointed libra- 
 rian to his imperial majeily. 
 
 Thefe were all th^ men of fuperla-

 at this period in the empire of Japan^ 
 
 Whilft this great patriot was thus 
 employed in executing his fcheme^ 
 of oeconomy with more zeal than 
 difcretion, and in providing his poor 
 relations with lucrative ofinces under 
 the government, a neg.ociation foe 
 peace was brought upon the carpet 
 by the mediation of certai^a neutral

 fixing the boundaries of the Chi-^

 given rife to the war : but when the 
 bufinefs was to deterrriine the claims 
 and pretenfions of his ally Brut-an- 
 tiffi, on the continent of Tartary, 
 he appeared fliffand infi move able as 
 mount Athos. He actually broke off 
 the negotiation, becaufe the emperor 
 of China would not engage to drive 
 by force of arms the troops of his 
 ally the princefs of Oflrog, from 
 a village or two belonging to 
 the Tartarian free- hooter, who, by 
 the bye, had left them defencelefs at 
 the beginning of the war, on pur- 
 . pofe that his enemies might, by tak-

 dreaded the ambition of the Japo-

 at univerfal empire ; and he was, 
 moreover, ftimulated by this outrage

 which all the caution of the two

 they fiiould be able to take the field,

 With this view they befieged and

 that the ruin of Brut-an-tiffi feemed 
 inevitable* Orator Taycho faw with 
 horror the precipice to the brink of 
 which his dear ally was driven. Not 
 that his fears were actuated by fym- 
 pathy or friendfhip. Such emotions 
 had never poflefled the heart of Tay- 
 cho. No ; he trembled becaufe he 
 faw his own popularity connefted 
 with the fate of the Tartar. It was 
 the fuccefs and petty triumphs of this 
 adventurer which had dazzled the 
 eyes of the blatant beafl, fo as to 
 diforder its judgrAent, and prepare it 
 for the illulions of the Orator : but, 
 now that Fortune feemed ready to 
 turn tail to Brut-an-tiffi, and leave 
 him a prey to his adverfaries, Tay- 
 cho knew the difpofitions of the

 monfter fo well as to prognoftlcate 
 that its applaufe and afFeftion would 
 be immediately turned into grum-

 felf, who had led it blindfold into this 
 unfortunate connexion, might pof- 
 fibly fall a facrifice to its refentment, 
 provided he could not immediate- 
 ly projed fome fcheme to divert its 
 attention, and transfer the blame 
 from his own fhoulders. 
 
 For this purpofe he employed his 
 invention, and fucceeded to his wifli.

 eight, at which the Dairo affifted in 
 perfon, hepropofed, and infifted upon 
 it,rhataftrongfquadronofFune{hould 
 be immediately ordered to fcour the

 ter fome paufe, the prefident Soo- 
 fan-lin-o ventured to obferve, that 
 the meafure feemed to be a little 
 abrupt and premature : that the na- 
 tion was already engaged in a very

 even loaded it with enormous debts ; 
 therefore little able to fuftain fuch 
 additional burthens as would, in all 
 probability, be occafioned by a rup-

 ful. Gotlo-mio fwore the land holders

 as his opinion, that they fhould be 
 w^y-laid and brought into the har- 
 bours of Japan j not by way of de- 
 claring war, but only with a view 
 to prevent the money's going into the 
 coffers of the Chinefe emperor. Fokh-

 Yak-ftrot, who had fome roman- 
 tic notions of honour and honefty, 
 reprefented that the nation had al- 
 ready incurred the cenfure of all its 
 neighbours, by feizing the merchant- 
 fhips of China, without any previ- 
 ous declaration of war : that the law 
 of nature and nations, confirmed by 
 repeated treaties, prefcribed a more 
 honourable method of proceeding, 
 than that of plundering like robbers, 
 the {hips of pacific merchants, who 
 trade on the faith of fuch laws and 
 fuch treaties : he was, therefore, of 
 opinion, that if the king of Corea 
 had in any fliape deviated from the 
 neutrality which he profeffed, fatis- 
 fadion lliould be demanded in the

 ufual form 3 and when that fhould be 
 refufed, it might be found neceffary 
 to proceed to compuliive meafures. 
 The Dairo acquiefced in this ad- 
 vice, and affured Taycho that an 
 ambaflador fhould be forthwith dif- 
 patched to Corea, with inftrudions 
 to demand an immediate and fatis- 
 fadlory explanation of that princess 
 conduifl and defigns with regard to 
 the empire of Japan. 
 
 This regular method of practice 
 would by no means fuit the purpofes of 
 Taycho, who rejefted it with great in- 
 folence and difdain. He bit his thumb 
 attheprefident; forked out his fingers 
 on his forehead at Gotto-mio ; wag- 
 ged his under-jaw at the Cuboy ; 
 fnapt his fingers at Sti-phi-rum-poo ; 
 grinned at the Sey-feo-gun ; made 
 the fign of the crofs or gallows to 
 Fokh-fi-rokhu; then turning to Yak- 
 ftrot, he clapped his thumbs in his 
 ears, and began to bray like an afs : 
 F 2 finally.

lOo l!he Htjlory and 
 
 finally, pulling out the badge of his 
 office, he threw it at the Dairo, who 
 in vain intreated him to be pacified ; 
 and wheeling to the right-about, 
 ftalked away, flapping the flat of his 
 hand upon a certain part that fhall 
 be namelefs. He was followed by 
 his kinfman the Quo Lob-kob, who 
 worlhipped him with the moft hum- 
 ble adoration. He now imitated this 
 great original in the fignal from behind 
 at parting, and in him it was attended 
 by a rumbling found -, but whether 
 this was the effedt of contempt or 
 comoundlion, I could never learn. 
 
 Taycho having thus carried his 
 point, which was to have a pre- 
 tence for quitting the reins of go- 
 vernment, made his next appeal to 
 the blatant beaft. He reminded the 
 xnany-headed monfter of the unin- 
 terrupted fuccefs which had attended 
 his adminiftration ; of his having 
 fupported the glorious Brut-an-tifii, 
 
 the

 the great bulwark of the religion of 
 Eupo, who had kept the common 
 enemy at bay, and filled all Afia with 
 the fame of his vidories. He told 
 them, that for his own part, he pre- 
 ,^ tended to have fubdued Fatfilio in 
 the heart of Tartary: that he defpif- 
 ed honours, and had flill a greater 
 contempt for riches ; and that all his 
 endeavours had been folely exerted 
 for the good of his country, which 
 was now brought tg the very verge 
 of deflrudlion. He then gave the 
 beaft to underftand that he had form- 
 ed a fcheme againfl the king of Co- 
 rea, which would not only have dif- 
 abled that monarch from executing 
 his hoftile intentions with refpedt to 
 Japan, but alfo have indemnified 
 this nation for the whole expence of 
 the war; but that his propofal having 
 been rejeded by the council of 
 Twenty-eight, who were influencd 
 by Yak-ftrot, a Ximian mountaineer

 without fpirit or underftanding, he 
 had refigned his office with intention 
 to retire to fome folitude, where he 
 fhould in filence deplore the misfor- 
 tunes of his country, and the ruin of 
 the Buponian religion, which muft fall 
 of courfe with its great protestor Brut- 
 an-tiffi, whom he forefaw the new 
 ininiftry would immediately abandon. 
 This addrefs threw Legion into 
 fuch a quandary, that it rolled it- 
 felf in the dirt, and yelled hide- 
 oufly. Mean while the Orator re- 
 treating to a cell in the neighbour- 
 hood of Meaco, hired the common 
 crier to go round the ftreets and pro- 
 claim that Taycho, being no longer 
 in a condition to afford any thing but 
 the bare neceffaries of life, would by 
 public fale difpofe of his ambling 
 mule and furniture, together with 
 an crmined robe of his wife, and the 
 greater part of his kitchen utenfils. 
 At this time he was well known 
 
 to

 to be worth upwards of twenty thou* 
 fand gold Obans ; neverthelefs, the 
 Mobile difcharging this circumftance 
 entirely from their refleftion, attend- 
 ed to nothing but the object which 
 the Orator was pleafed to prefent» 
 They thought it was a piteous cafe, 
 and a great fcandal upon the govern- 
 ment, that fuch a patriot, w^ho had 
 faved the nation from ruin and dif- 
 grace, fhould be reduced to the cruel 
 neceffity of felling his mule and his 
 houfliold furniture. Accordingly they 
 raifed a clamour that foon rung in 
 the ears of Gio-gio and his favourite. 
 It was fuppofed that Mura-clami 
 fuggefted on this oecafion to his 
 countryman Yak-ftrot, the hint of 
 offering a penfion to Taycho, by way 
 of remuneration for his paft fervices^ 
 ** If he refufes it, (faid he) the offer 
 will at leaft refled: fome credit upoa 
 the Dairo and the adminiftration > 
 but, fhould he accept of it, (which is 
 
 F 4 mucb 
 

<page 113>
104 ^^^ Hiflory and 
 
 much more likely) it will either flop 
 his mouth entirely, or expofe him 
 to the cenfure of the people, who now 
 adore him as a murour of diiinterefl- 
 ed integrity." The advice v/as in- 
 ilantly complied with : the Dairo 
 iigned a patent for a very ample pen- 
 iion to Taycho and his heirs ; which 
 patent Yak-ftrot delivered to him 
 next day at his cell in the country. 
 This miracle of patriotifm received 
 the bounty as a turnpike-man re- 
 ceives the toll, and then flapped his 
 door full in the face of the favourite : 
 yet, nothing of what Mura-clami 
 had prognofticated, came to pafs. 
 The many- tailed monfter, far from 
 calling in queftion the Orator's dif- 
 intereltednels, confidered his accept- 
 ance of the penfion as a proof of his 
 moderation, in receiving fuch a tri- 
 fling reward for the great fervices he 
 had done his country ; and the ge- 
 nerofity of the Dairo, inflead of ex- 
 citing

 citing the leaft emotion of gratitude 
 in Taycho's own breaft, aftcd only 
 as a golden key to unlock all the 
 fluices of his virulence and abufe. 
 Thefe, however, he kept within 
 bounds until he ihould fee what 
 would be the fate of Brut-an-tiffi, 
 who now feemed to be in the condi- 
 tion of a criminal at the foot of the 
 ladder. In this dilemma, he obtained 
 a very unexped:ed reprieve. Before the 
 army of the Mantchoux could take 
 the leaft advantage of the fettle- 
 men t they had made on his fron- 
 tiers, their emprefs died, and wasfuc- 
 ceeded by a weak prince,, who no 
 fooner afcended the throne than he 
 ftruck up a peace with the Tartar 
 freebooter, and even ordered hia 
 troops to join him againft the Oflrog^. 
 to whom they had hitherto adled as 
 auxiliaries. Such an acceffion of

 Taychono fooner perceived his ally 
 thus unexpeftedly delivered from the 
 dangers that furrounded him, than he 
 began to repent of his own refigna- 
 tion ; and refolved once more, to 
 force his way to the helm, by the 
 fame means he had fo fuccefsfully 
 ufed before. He was, indeed, of fuch 
 a turbulent difpofition as could not 
 reliih the repofe of private life, and 
 his fpirit fo corroiive, that it would 
 have preyed upon himfelf, if he could 
 not have found external food for it to 
 devour. He therefore began to pre- 
 pare his engines, and provide proper 
 emiifaries to befpatter, and raife a 
 hue-and-cry againft Yak-ftrot at a 
 convenient feafon ; not doubting but 
 an occafion would foon preient itfelf, 
 confidering the temper, inexperience, 
 and prejudices of this Ximian poli-

 he had adopted, fo contrary to the 
 prefent fpirit of the blatant beaft. 
 
 In thefe preparations he was 
 much comforted and affifted by 
 his kinfman and pupil Lob-kob,. 
 who entered into his meafures with 
 furprizing zeal ; and had the good 
 luck to light on fuch inftruments as 
 were admirably fuited to the work 
 in hand. Yak-ftrot was extremely, 
 pleafed at the feceffion of Taycho> 
 who had been a very troublefome 
 collegue to him in the adminlftra- 
 tion, and run counter to all the 
 fchemes he had projecSted for the 
 good of the empire. He now found 
 himfelf at liberty to follow his own? 
 inventions, and being naturally ant 
 enthuliaft, believed himfelf born to 
 be the faviour of Japan. Some efforts, 
 however, he made to acquire popula- 
 rity, proved fruitlefs. Perceiving the 
 people were, by the Orator's inftiga--

 anfwer ; and this being denied, de- 
 clared war againft him, according to 
 the pradice of all civilized nations : 
 but even this meafure failed of ob- 
 taining that approbation for which it 
 was taken. The monfler, tutored by 
 Taycho and his minifters, exclaimed, 
 that the golden opportunity was loft, 
 inafmuch as, during the obfervance 
 of thofe ufelefs forms, the treafures 
 of Corea were fafely brought home to 
 that kingdom j treafures which, had 
 they been interrupted by the Fune of 
 Japan, would have payed off the debts 
 of the nation, and enabled the inhabi- 
 tants of Meaco to pave their ftreets 
 with filver. By the bye, this trea- 
 fure exifted no where but in the fic- 
 tion of Taycho and the imagination 
 of the blatant beaft, which never at- 
 tempted to ufe the evidence of fenfe

 might be, which proceeded from the 
 mouth of the Orator. 
 
 Yak-ftrot, having now taken upon 
 himfelf the tafli officering the political 
 bark, refolved to fhew the Japonefe, 
 that altho' he recommended peace, 
 he was as well qua] ified as his predecef- 
 for for conducting the war. Fie there- 
 fore, with the affiftance of the Fatz- 
 man, projeded three naval enterprizes; 
 the firft againfl: Thin-quo, the con- 
 quell of which had been unfuccefs-

 cond was deflined for the reducftion 
 of Fan-yah, one of the moll: conii- 
 derable fettlements belonging to the 
 king of Corea, in the Indian ocean ;

 merit which either Yak-ftrot, or any

 from the fuccefs of fuch expeditions, 
 is that of adopting the moft feafible 
 of thofe fchemes which are prefent- 
 €d by different projeftors, and of ap- 
 pointing fuch commanders as are ca-

 gour and fagacity.

 pire of Japan. In thefe fentiments, 
 hewith-held the annual tribute which 
 had been lately payed toBrut-an-tiffi; 
 by which means he faved a very con- 
 fiderable fum to the nation, and, at 
 the fame time, refcued it from the 
 infamy of fuch a difgraceful impofi- 
 tion. — He expefted the thanks of 
 the public for this exertion of his 
 influence in favour of his country ; 
 but he reckoned without his hoft. 
 What he flattered himfelf would 
 yield him an abundant harveft of ho- 
 nour and applaufe, produced nothing 
 but odium and reproach, as we fhall

 tion, littlenefs of mind, and lack of 
 underftanding. He purchafed a vaft

 vailed upon his mafter to veil him 
 with the badges and trappings of 
 all the honorary inftitutions of the 
 empire, altho' this multiplication of 
 orders in the perfon of one man, was 
 altogether without precedent or pre- 
 fcription. This was only fetting 
 himfelf up as the more confpicuous 
 mark for envy and detraction. 
 
 Not contented with engrofling the 
 perfonal favour and confidence of his 
 Ibvereign, and, in efFecl, direding the 
 whole machine of government, he 
 thought his fortune ftill imperfedt^,

 therefore employed all his invention, 
 together with that of his friends, to 
 find out fome fpecious pretext for 
 removing the old Cuboy from his

 afforded what all their intrigues had 
 not been able to procure.

 gan to loath his ufual food, and fome- 
 times even declined fliewing himftlf 
 to the Bonzes at his levee ; fymptoms 
 that alarmed all his friends and depen- 
 dants. Inftead of frequenting the 
 affemblies of the great, he now at- 
 tended affiduoufly at all groanings 
 and chriftenings, grew extremely 
 fond of caudle, and held conferences 
 with practitioners, both male and fe- 
 male, in the art of midwifry. When 
 bufinefs or ceremony obliged him ta 
 vifit any of the Quos or Quanbukus 
 of Meaco; he, by afurprifing inflind:, 
 ran diredly to the nurfery, where, if 
 there happened to be a child in 
 the cradle, he took it up, and if it

 moil extravagant of all his whims, 
 was what he exhibited one day in his 
 own court-yard. Obferving a neft 
 with fome eggs, which the goofe had 
 quitted, he forthwith dropped his 
 trowfers, and fquatting down in the at- 
 titude of incubation, began to flretch 
 out his neck, to hifs and to cackle^ as 
 if he had been really metamorphofed 
 into the animal whofe place he now 
 fup plied. 
 
 It was on the back of this adven-

 ing, and as great a goflip as the 
 barber of Midas, in paying bis morn-

 while Gio-gio, by the advice of his 
 favourite, publiihed a proclamation, 
 declaring it was not for the honour 
 of Japan that her treafury fliould be 
 managed either by a witch or an old 
 woman. 
 
 Fika-kaka being thus removed, 
 Yak-ftrot was appointed treafurer 
 and Cuboy in his place, and now 
 ruled the roafl: with uncontroulecl 
 authority. On the very threfhold 
 of his greatnefs, however, he made 
 a falfe ftep, which was one caufe 
 of his tottering, during the whole 
 fequel of his adminiftration. In 
 order to refute the calumnies and 
 defeat the intrigues of Taycho in the 
 airemblies of the people, he chofe a^ 
 an affociate in the miniftry Fokh-fi-t 
 rokhu, who was at that inftant the 
 moft unpopular man in the whole 
 empire of Japan ; and at the infti- 
 gation of this collegue, deprived of

 which had been beftowed upon them

 fo many mouths opened to augment 
 the clamour againft his own perfon 
 and adminlftration. 
 
 It might be imagined, that while 
 he thus fet one part of the nation at 
 defiance, he would endeavour to cul- 
 tivate the other ; and, in particular, 
 flrive to conciliate the good-will of 
 the nobility, who did not fee his 
 exaltation without umbrage. But, 
 inftead of ingratiating himfelf with 
 them by a liberal turn of demea-

 with a good grace ; making entertain- 
 ments for them at his palace ; and 
 mixing in their fecial parties of plea- 
 fure ; Yak-ftrot always appeared on

 conftpaint to his whole behaviour. 
 He ftudied poftures, and, in giving 
 audience, generally ftood in the atti- 
 tude of the idol Fo; fo that hefome- 
 times was miftaken for an image of 
 flone. He formed a fcale of gefticu- 
 lation in a great variety of divifions, 
 comprehendingtheflighteft inclinati- 
 on of the head, the front-nod, the fide- 
 nod, the bow, the half, the femi-demi- 
 bow, with the fhuffle, the Hide, the 
 circular, femi-circular, and quadrant 
 fweep of the right foot. With equal 
 care and precifion did he model the 
 oeconomy of his looks into the divi- 
 fions and fub-divifions of the full- 
 flare, the fide-glance, the penfive 
 look, the pouting look, the gay look, 
 the vacant look, and the fl:olid look. 
 To thefe different expreffions of the 
 eye he fuited the correfponding fea-

 diflributed occafionally, according to 
 the difference of rank and impor- 
 tance oF the various individuals with 
 whom he had communication. 
 
 But thefe affected airs being aflum- 
 ed in defpite of nature, he appeared as 
 aukward as a native of Angola, when 
 he is firft hampered with cloaths ; 
 or a Highlander, obliged by aft of 
 parliament to wear breeches. — In- 
 deed, the diftance obferved by Yak- 
 ftrot in his behaviour to the nobles 
 of Niphon, was imputed to his be- 
 ing confcious of a fulphureous fmell 
 which came from his own body ; fo 
 that greater familiarity on his fide 
 might have bred contempt. He 
 took delight in no other converfa- 
 tion but that of two or three obfcure

 cies offtate; and with thefe he fpent 
 many an Attic evening. 
 
 The gods, not yet tired of fporting 
 with the farce of human govern- 
 ment, were ilill refolved to fhew by 
 what inconiiderable fprings a mighty 
 empire may be moved. The new 
 Cuboy was ^vaftly well difpofed to 
 make his Ximian favourites great 
 men. It was in his power to be- 
 ftow places and penfions upon them; 
 but it was not in his power to give 
 them conlequence in the eyes of the 
 public. The adminiftration of Yak- 
 ftrot could not fail of being propi- 
 tious to his own family, and poor 
 relations, who were very numerous.

 emillaries, and primed all their en-

 every corner of Meaco with rumours, 
 jealoufies, and fufpicions. Yak-ftrot 
 was reprefented as a flatefman with-

 and endangered the very exigence of 
 the Bnponian religion, in withdraw- 
 ing the annual fubfidy from the great 
 Brut-an-tirii ; that he wanted to

 and advantage of the empire by a

 as monfters in nature, with cloven 
 feet, long tails, faucer eyes, iron

 Taycho had Legion's underfland-

 who owed their preferment to his

 low his fortune, or pay the lead re-

 afliareofit Gotto-mio, who dreaded 
 nothing fom'jch as the continuation of 
 the war, and divers other noblemen, 
 whofe alliance contributed very lit- 
 tle to his intereft or advantage. Got- 
 to~mio was univerfally envied for his 
 wealthy and detefled for his avarice: 
 the reft were either of the She-it- 
 kum-ilieit-eifadion, which had been 
 long in difgrace with the Mobile i 
 or men of defperate fortunes andloofe 
 morals, who attached themfelves to 
 the Ximian favourite folely on ac- 
 count of the ports and penlions he 
 had to beflow. 
 
 During thefe domeflic commo-

 to profper in the Indian ocean. Thin-

 have-, in fome meafure, reconciled the 
 Niphonites to the new miniflry :

 that were obtained under the aufpi-

 took it highly amifs that Yak-ftrot 
 {hould pre fume to take any ftep which 
 might redound to the glory of the 
 empire. Nothing could have pleafed 
 the monfter at this juncture fo much 
 as the mifcarriage of both expedi- 
 tions, and a certain information that 
 all the troops and fhips employed in 
 them had miferably perifhed. The 
 king of Corea, however, was {o

 vice of the cabinet of Pekin touch-

 The councils of Pekin have been 
 ever fruitful of intrigues to embroil 
 the reft of Afia. They fuggefted a 
 plan to the king of Corea, which he 
 forthwith put in execution. The 
 land of Fumma, which borders on 
 the Corean territories, was governed 
 by a prince nearly allied to the king 
 of Corea, although his fubjeds had 
 very intimate connexions in the way 
 of commerce with the empire of 
 Japan, which, indeed, had entered 
 into an ofFenfive and defenfive alli-

 loudly of this iniquitous propofal ,• he 
 made a merit of rejeding the alter- 
 native 'y and immediately demanded 
 of the court of Meacd, the fuccours 
 ftipulated in the treaty of alliance, in 
 order to defend his domiinions. In

 had nothing to fear from their hof~ 
 tiUties. 
 
 Yak-flrot was not much embar- 
 railed on this occafion. Without 
 fufpeding the leaft colhifion among 
 the parties, he refolved to take the 
 prince of Fumma under his pro- 
 tedion, thereunto moved by divers 
 confiderations. Firft and foremolt^ 
 he piqued himfelf upon i.js good 
 faith : fecondly, he iinew that t.he 
 trade vvitii Fumma was of great 
 coiifequcnce to Japan .; and therefore 
 concluded that his fupporting the fo- 
 vereign of it would be a popular 
 meafure: thirdly, he hoped that the 
 multiplication of expence incurred 
 by this new war, would make the 
 blatant beall: wince under its burden,

 neral called Le-yaw-ter, in order to 
 concert with the prince and his mi- 
 niflers the operations of the cam-

 This officer was counted one of 
 the fhrewdeft politicians in Japan, 
 and having refided many years as 
 ambaffador in Fumma, was well ac- 
 quainted with the genius of that 
 people. Fie immediately difcovered 
 the fcene which had been aded be- 
 hind the curtain. He found that the 
 prince of Fumma, far from having 
 made any preparations for his own 
 defence, had ad:ually withdrawn his 
 garrifons from the frontier places, 
 which were by this time peaceably 
 occupied by the invading army of

 troops he had, were without cloaths, 
 arms, and difcipline ^ and that he 
 had amufed the court of Meaco with 
 falfe mufters, and a fpecious ac- 
 countof levies and preparations which 
 had been made. In a w^ord, though 
 he could not learn the particulars, 
 he comprehended the whole myilery 
 of the fecret negotiations. He up- 
 braided the minifter of Fummawith 
 perfidy, refufed to alfume the com- 
 mand of the Japonefe auxiliaries 
 when they arrived, and returning to 
 Meaco, communicated his difcove- 
 ries and fufpicions to the new Cu- 
 boy. But he did not meet with that 
 reception which he thought he de- 
 ferved for intelligence of fuch impor- 
 tance. Yak-ftrot affeded to doubt; 
 perhaps, he was not really convinced; 
 or, if he was, thought proper to tem- 
 porize ; and he was in the right for 
 fo doing. A rupture with Fumma

 the prince to declare openly for the 
 enemies of Japan ; in which cafe the 
 inhabitants of Niphon would have 
 loft the benefit of a very advanta- 
 geous trade. They had already been 
 great fufferers in commerce by the 
 breach with the king of Corea, 
 whofe ,fubje(5ts had been ufed to 
 take off" great quantities of the Ja-^ 
 ponefe manufactures, for which they 
 payed in gold and filver ; and they 
 could ill bear fuch an additional lofs 
 as an interruption of the trade with 
 Fumma would have occafioned. The 
 Cuboy, therefore, continued to treat 
 the prince of that country as a ftaunch 
 ally, who had facrificed every other 
 confideration to his good faith ; and, 
 far from reftriding himfelf to the 
 number of troops and Fune ftipu- 
 lated in the treaty, fent over a much 
 more numerous body of forces and 
 fliips of war j declaring, at the fame

 of Fumma with the whole power

 Such a confiderable diverfion of 
 the Japonefe ilrength could not fail 
 to anfwcr, in fome meafure, the ex- 
 pedlation of the two fovereigns of 
 China and Corea y but it did not 
 prevent the fuccefs of the expedi- 
 tions which were actually employed 
 againft their colonies in the Indian 
 ocean. It was not in his power, 
 however, to protefl: Fumma, had the 
 invaders been in earneft : but the 
 combined army of the Chinefe and 
 Coreans had orders to protradt the 
 war 5. and, inflead of penetrating to 
 the capital, at a time when the Fumr 
 niians, tho' joined with the auxi- 
 liaries of Japan, were not numerous 
 enough to look them in the face, they 
 made a fuU-ftop in the middle of 
 their march, and quietly retired into 
 fummer quarters.

 war, they had recourfe to the good 
 offices of a certain neutral power, 
 called Sab-oi, fovereignof the moun- 
 tains of Cambodia. This prince ac- 
 cordingly offered his mediation at the 
 court of Meaco, and it was immedi- 
 ately accepted. — The negotiation for 
 peace, which had been broke off in 
 the miniftry of Taycho, was now re- 
 fumed ; an ambaffador plenipotentiary 
 arrived from Pekin ; and Gotto-mio 
 was fent thither in the fame ca-

 derable treafure, fufficient to indem-

 expedition. This, though the moll 
 grievous, was not the only difafler 
 which the war brought upon the 
 Coreans. Their diflant fettlement 
 of Lli-nam was likcwife taken by 
 general Tra-rep, and the inhabitants 
 payed an immenfe fum in order to 
 redeem their capital from plun- 
 der. 
 
 Thefe fuccelTes did not at all re-

 which was indeed become equally 
 neceflaryto all the parties concerned.

 pened, than he embarked what troops 
 were at hand, and failing diredlly to

 it always in his power to fecure a 
 majority in both thefe conventions, 
 by means that may be eafily gueffed;

 fince his acceffion to the helm: he 
 demonflrated the neceffity of a paci-

 down with this aflembly of the peo- 
 ple, which, in fpite of his flannel, 
 his night-caps, his crutches, and his 
 groans, confirmed the treaty of peace 
 by a great majority. Not that they

 of confequence, that there was fome- 
 thing of divinity in his perfon. Full 
 of this notion, he difcai:ded his rhym- 
 ftcrs and his dirt-caflers as unnecef- 
 fary, and refolved to bear the brunt 
 of the battle in his own individual. 
 Fokh-li-rokhu advifed him, ne- 
 verthelefs, to fill his trowfers with 
 gold Obans, which he might throw 
 at Legion in cafe of neceffity, affur- 
 ing him that this was the only am- 
 munition which the monfter could 
 not withftand. The advice was good; 
 and the Cuboy might have followed 
 it, without being obliged to the trea- 
 fury of Japan; for he was by thi^

 time become immenfely rich, in 
 confequence of having found a hoard 
 in digging his garden : but this was 
 an expedient which Yak-ftrot could 
 never be prevailed upon to ufe, either 
 on this or any other occafion. Iiv- 
 deed, he was now fo convinced of 
 his own perfon.al energy, that he 
 perfuaded his mailer Gio-gio to come 
 forth and fee it operate on the bla- 
 tant beaft. Accordingly the Dairo 
 afcended his car of flate, while the 
 Cuboy, arrayed in all his trappings, 
 flood before him v/ith the reins in his 
 own hand, and drove diredly to the 
 enemy, who waited for him without 
 flinching. Being arrived within 
 dung-fhot of Jan-ki-dtzin, he made 
 a halt, and putting himfelf in the 
 attitude of the idol Fo, with a fimper 
 in his countenance. Teemed to invite 
 the warrior to make a full difcharge 
 of his artillery. He did not long 
 wait in fufpence. The balls fooa

 and a great number took effed: upon 
 his perfon. At length, he received 
 a fliot upon his right temple which 
 brought him to the ground. All 
 his gewgaws fluttered, and his buck- 
 ram dou-blet rattled as he fell. 
 Llur-chir no fooner beheld him prof- 
 trate, than advancing with the mon- 
 iter, he began to repeat his rhymes, 
 at which every mouth and every 
 tail of Legion was opened and lift- 
 ed up; and fuch a torrent of filth 
 fquirted from thefe channels, that 
 the unfortunate Cuboy was quite 
 overwhelmed. Nay, he mufl have 
 been adtually fuffocated where he 
 lay, had not fome of the Dairo's at- 
 tendants interpofed and refcued him 
 from the vengeance of the mon- 
 fter. He was carried home in fuch 
 an unfavoury pickle, that his family 
 fmelled his difafter long before he 
 came in fight ; and when he appear-

 ed with ordure, blinded with dirt, 
 and even deprived of fenfe and mo-

 terica paffio. He was immediately 
 ftripped and waftied, and other means 
 being ufed for his recovery, he in 
 a little time retrieved his recol- 
 ledlion. 
 
 He was now pretty well unde- 
 ceived, with refped to the divinity 
 of his perfon : but his enthufiafm 
 took a new turn. He afpired to the 
 glory of martyrdom, and refolved to 
 devote himfelf as a vicftim to patri- 
 otic virtue. While his attendants 
 were employed in wafhing off the 
 filth that fluck to his beard, he 
 recited in a theatrical tone, the 
 ftanza of a famous Japonefe bard, 
 whofe foul afterwards tranfmigrated 
 into the body of the Roman poet 
 Horatius Flaccus, and infpired him

 His friends hearing him declare 
 his refolution of dying for his coun* 
 try, began to fear that his under^ 
 flanding was difturbed. They ad- 
 vifed him to yield to the torrent, 
 which was become too impetuous 
 to ftem ; to refign the Cuboyihip 
 quietly, and referve his virtues for 
 a more favourable occafion. In vain 
 his friends remonftrated : in vain his 
 wife and children employed their 
 tears and intreaties to the fame pur- 
 pofe. He lent a deaf ear to all their 
 fcllicitations, until they began to 
 drop feme hints that fcemed to im- 
 ply

 ply a fufpicion of his infanity, which 
 alarmed him exceedingly ; and the 
 Dairo himfelffignifying to him in pri- 
 vate, that it was become abfolutelyne- 
 cefTary to temporize, he refigned the 
 reins of government with a heavy 
 heart, though not before he was 
 affured that he fl:iould ftill continue 
 to exert his influence behind the 
 curtain^ 
 
 Gio-gio's own perfon had not 
 efcaped untouched in the laft flcir- 
 milh. Jan-ki-dtzin was tranfported 
 to fuch a pitch of infolence, that he 
 aimed fome balls at the Dairo, and 
 one of them taking place exaftly 
 betwixt the eyes, defiled his whole 
 vifage. Had the laws of Japari 
 been executed in all their feveri- 
 ty againfl: this audacious plebeian, 
 he would have fufFered crucifixion 
 on the fpot : but Gio-gio, being 
 good-natured even to a fault, con- 
 tented himfelf with ordering fome

 of his attendants to apprehend and 
 put him in the public flocks, after 
 having feizcd the whole cargo of 
 filth which he had colledted at his 
 habitation for the manufadture of 
 his balls. Legion was no fooner 
 informed of his difgrace, than it re- 
 leafed him by force, being therein 
 comforted and abetted by the de- 
 claration of a puny magiftrate, cal- 
 led PrafF-patt-phogg, who feized 
 thiV, as the only opportunity he 
 ihould ever find of giving himfelf 
 any confequence in the common- 
 wealth. Accordingly, the monfter 
 hoifting him and Jan-ki-dtzin oil 
 their (houlders, went in proceffion 
 through the ftreets of Meaco, hol- 
 lowing, huzzaing, and extolling this 
 venerable pair of patriots as the Pal- 
 ladia of the liberty of Japan. 
 
 The monfter's officious zeal on 
 this occafion, was far from being 
 agreeable t© Mr, Orator Taycho,

 who took umbrage at this exalta- 
 tion of his two underftrappers, and 
 from that moment devoted Jan- 
 ki-dtzin to deftrudlion. The Dairo 
 finding it abfolutely neceflary for 
 the fupport of his government, that 
 this dirt-monger fhould be punifh- 
 ed, gave directions for trying him 
 according to the laws of the land. 
 He was ignominioufly expelled from 
 the affembly of the people, where 
 his old patron Taycho not only dif- 
 claimed him, but even reprefented 
 him as a worthlefs atheift and fower 
 of iedition : but he efcaped the 
 weight of a more fevere fentence 
 in another tribunal, by retreating 
 without beat of drum, into the ter- 
 ritories of China, where he found 
 an afylum, from whence he made 
 divers ineffecflual appeals to the mul- 
 titudinous beaft at Niphon. 
 
 As for Yak-ftrot, he was every 
 thing but a down-right martyr to 
 
 the 
 

<page 167>
158 T^he Hijiory and 
 
 the odium of the public, which pro- 
 duced a ferment all over the nation. 
 His name was become a term of 
 reproach. He was burnt or cruci- 
 fied in effigy in every city, town, 
 village, and diftridl of Niphon. Even 
 his own countrymen, the Ximians, 
 held him in abhorrence and execra- 
 tion. Notwithftanding his parti- 
 ality to the 7iatale Joluniy he had 
 not been able to provide for all 
 thofe adventurers who came from 
 thence in confequence of his promo- 
 tion. The whole number of the 
 difappointed became his enemies of 
 courfe; and the refl finding; them- 
 felves expofed to the animofity and 
 ill offices of their fellow-fubjecfts of 
 Niphon, who hated the whole comf^ 
 munity for his fake, inveighed againfl 
 Yak-flrot as the curfe of their na- 
 tion. 
 
 In the midH: of all this deteftation 
 and difgrace, it mufl be owned for 
 
 the 
 

<page 168>

 the fake of truth, that Yak-ftrot 
 was one of the honefteft men in 
 Japan, and certainly the greatefl 
 benefactor to the empire. Juft, up-^ 
 right, fincere, and charitable ; his 
 heart was fufceptible of friendfhip 
 and tendernefs. He was a virtu- 
 ous hufband, a fond father, a kind 
 mafter, and a zealous friend. In his 
 public capacity he had nothing in 
 view but the advantage of Japan, 
 in the profecution of which he 
 flattered hirafelf he fhould be able 
 to difplay all the abilities of a pro- 
 found ftatefman, and all the virtues 
 of the mofl fublime patriotifm. It 
 was here he over-rated his own im- 
 portance. His virtue became the 
 dupe of his vanity. Nature had de- 
 nied him fliining talents, as well as 
 that eafinefs of deportment, that af- 
 fabihty, liberal turn, and verfatile 
 genius, without which no man can 
 ever figure at the head of an admi- 
 
 niflratioii* 
 

<page 169>
i6o Tihe Hijhry and 
 
 niftration. Nothing could be more 
 abfurd than his being charged with 
 want of parts and underftanding to 
 guide the helm of government, 
 conlidering how happily it had 
 been conducted for many years by 
 Fika-kaka, whofe natural genius 
 would have been found unequal 
 even to the art and myftery of 
 wool-combing. Befides, the war 
 had profpered in his hands as much 
 as it ever did under the aufpices of 
 his predeceflbr ; though, as I have be- 
 fore obferved, neither the one nor 
 the other could juftly claim any 
 merit from its fuccefs. 
 
 But Yak-flrot's fervices to the 
 public, were much more important 
 in another refpedt. He had the 
 refolution to diflblve the fhamefal 
 and pernicious engagements which 
 the empire had contrafted on the 
 continent of Tartary, He lightened 
 the intolerable burthens of the em- 
 pire ;

 pire : he faved its credit when it 
 was ftretched even to burfting. He 
 made a peace, which, if not the moft 
 glorious that might have been ob- 
 tained, was, at leaft, the moft folid 
 and advantageous that ever Japan 
 had concluded with any pov/er what- 
 foever^ and, in particular, much 
 more honourable, ufeful, and afcer- 
 tained, than that which Taycho 
 had agreed to fubfcribe the preced- 
 ing year 3 and, by this peace, he 
 put an end to all the horrors of a 
 cruel war, which had ravaged the 
 beft parts of Afia, and deftroyed 
 the lives of fix hundred thoufand 
 men every year. On the whole, Yak- 
 ftrot's good qualities were refped:- 
 able. There was very little vi- 
 cious in his compoiition \ and as to 
 his follies, they were rather the 
 fubjedls of ridicule than of refent- 
 meat.

 io far into the north of Legion's dif- 
 pleafure. Nay, it was fhrevvdly luf- 
 pedled that fome of their emiffaries 
 had been very aclive againft him in 
 the day of his difcomfiture. They 
 flattered themfelves, that if he could 
 be effcdually driven from the pre- 
 fence of the Dairo, they would fuc- 
 ceed to his influence; and in the 
 mean time would acquire popularity 
 by turning tail to, and kicking at, 
 the Xlmian favourite, who had affo- 
 ciated them in the adminiilration in 
 confequence of their vowing eternal 
 attachment to his interefl:, and con-r 
 ftant jjLibmiflion to his v^^ill. Having 
 held a fecret conclave to concert 
 their operations, they began to exe-»- 
 cu-te their plan, by feducing Yak- 
 ftrot into certain odious raeafures of 
 railing new impofitions on the peo.- 
 ple, which did not fail, indeed, to 
 
 increafe

 increafe the clamour of the blatant 
 Beaft, and promote its filthy dif- 
 tharge upwards and downwards y 
 but then the torrents were divided^ 
 and many a tail was lifted up againfl 
 the real projectors of the fcheme 
 which the favourite had adopted. 
 They now refolved to make a merit 
 with the Mobile, by picking a ger- 
 man quarrel with Strot, and infult- 
 ing him in public. Gotto-mio caufed 
 a fcrubbing-poft to be fet up in the 
 night, at the Cuboy's door.— The 
 fcribe Zan-ti-fic prefented him with 
 a fcheme for the importation of 
 brimftone into the ifland of Ximo : 
 the other fcribe pretended he could 
 not fpell the barbarous names of the 
 Cuboy's relations and countrymen, 
 who were daily thrufl into the moft 
 lucrative ^employments. As for 
 Twitz-er the Financier, he never 
 approached Yak-ftrot without claw- 
 ing his knuckles in derifion. At the 
 
 council 
 

<page 173>
164 ^'he Hijlory and 
 
 council of Twenty-Eight, they 
 thwarted every plan he propofed, and 
 turned into ridicule every word he 
 Ipoke. At length they bluntly told 
 the Dairo, that as Yak llrot re- 
 figned the reins of adminiftration 
 in public, he muft likewiie give up 
 -his management behind the curtain 5 
 for they were not at all difpofed to 
 anfwer to the people for meafures 
 did:ated by an invilible agent. This 
 was but a reafonable demand, in 
 which the emperor feemed to ac- 
 quiefce. But the new minifters 
 thought it was requifite that they 
 lliould commit fome overt adl of 
 contempt for the abdicated Cuboy. 
 One of his neareft relations had ob- 
 tained a profitable office in the ifland 
 of Ximo ; and of this, the new ca- 
 bal infifted he fhould be immediate- 
 ly deprived. TheDairo remonllrated 
 againft the injuftice of turning a 
 man out of his place for no other

 reafon but to fatisfy their caprice; 
 and plainly told them he could not 
 do it without infringing his honour, 
 as he had given his word that the 
 pofleffor fhould enjoy the poft for 
 life. Far from being fatisfied with 
 this declaration, they urged their de- 
 mand with redoubled importunity, 
 mixed with menaces which equally 
 embarrafled and incenfed the good- 
 natured Dairo. At laft Yak-ftrot, 
 taking compaffion upon his indul- 
 gent mafter, prevailed upon his 
 kinfman to releafe him from the 
 obligation of his word, by making 
 a voluntary refignation of his office. 
 The Dairo fell fick of vexation : 
 his life was defpaired of; and all 
 Japan was filled with alarm and ap- 
 prehenfion at the profped: of an in- 
 fant's afcending the throne: for the 
 heir apparent was ftill in the cradle. 
 Their fears, however, were hap- 
 pily difappointed by the recovery of

 the emperor, who, to prevent as 
 much as poffible the inconvenien- 
 ces that might attend his demife, 
 during the minority of his fon, re- 
 folved that a regency fhould be efla- 
 bhfhed and ratified by the dates of 
 the empire. The plan^ of this re* 
 gency he concerted in private with 
 the venerable princefs his grand- 
 mother, and his friend Yak-flrot ) 
 and then communicated the defign 
 to his minifters, who knowing the 
 quarter from whence it had come, 
 treated it with coldnefs and con- 
 tempt. They were fo elevated by 
 their laft triumph over the Ximian 
 favourite, that they overlooked eve- 
 ry obftacle to their ambition ; and 
 determined to render the Dairo de- 
 pendant on them, and them only. 
 With this view they threw cold 
 water on the prefent meafure ; and 
 to mark their hatred of the fa- 
 vourite more ftrongly in the eyes of 
 
 Legion, 
 

<page 176>

 Legion, they endeavoureil to exclude 
 the name of his patronefs the Dairo's 
 grandmother, -from the deed of re- 
 gency, though their malice was fruf* 
 trated by the vigilance of Yak-itrot, 
 and the indignation of the ftates, 
 who refented thiis affront offered to 
 the family of their fovereign. 
 
 The tyranny of this junto became 
 fo intolerable to Glo-gio, that he re- 
 folved to fhake off their yoke, what- 
 ever might be the confequence : but 
 before any effedtual ftep was taken 
 for this purpofe, Yak-ftrot, who un- 
 derftood mechanics, and had fludi- 
 ed the art of puppet-playing, tried 
 an experiment on the organs of the 
 cabal, which he tempered with in- 
 dividually without fuccefs. Inllead 
 of uttering what he prompted, the 
 founds came out quite altered in their 
 paffage. Gotto-muo grunted; the Fi- 
 nancier Twitz-er bleated, or rather 
 brayed ; one fcribe mewed like a

 all. In fliort, they were found fo 
 perverfe and refrad:ory, that the ma- 
 fler of the motion kicked them off 
 the ftage, and fupplied the fcene 
 with a new fet of puppets made of 
 very extraordinary materials. They 
 were the very figures through whofe 
 pipes the charge of mal-adminiftra- 
 tion had been fo loudly founded 
 againft the Ximian favourite. They 
 were now muftered by the Fatzman, 
 and hung upon the pegs of the very 
 famepuppet-fhew-man againft whom 
 they had fo vehemently inveighed. 
 Even thefuperannuatedFika-kaka ap- 
 peared again upon the ftage as an adtor 
 of fome confequence ; and infifted 
 upon it, that his metamorphofis was 
 a meer calumny. But Taycho and 
 Lob-kob kept aloof, becaufe Yak- 
 ftrot had not yet touched them 
 on the proper keys. 
 
 The

 The firft exhibition of the new 
 puppets, was called T^opfy-tiirvy^ a 
 farce in which they overthrew all 
 the paper houfes which their pre- 
 decefTors had built : but they per- 
 formed their parts in fuch confu- 
 fion, that Yak-ftrot interpofing to 
 keep them in order, received divers 
 contuiions and fevere kicks on the 
 fhins, which made his eyes water; 
 and, indeed, he had in a little time 
 reafon enough to repent of the re- 
 volution he had brought about. The 
 new fticks of adminiftration proved 
 more ftiff and unmanageable than 
 the former ; and thofe he had dif- 
 carded, afTcciating with the blatant 
 Beaft, bedaubed him with fuch a 
 variety of filth, drained from all 
 the fewers of fcurrility, that he 
 really became a public nuifance. 
 Gotto-mio pretended remorfe of 
 confcience, and declared he would 
 impeach Yak-ftrot for the peace 
 
 Vol. II. I which

 which he himfelf had negotiated. 
 Twitz-er ihivelled and cried, and cafl 
 figures to prove that Yak-ftrot was 
 born for the deftrudtion of Japan; and 
 Zan-ti-fic lured an incendiary Bonze 
 called Toks, to throw fire-balls by 
 night into the palace of the favourite. 
 In this diflrefs Strot cafl: his 
 eyes on Taycho the monfter- 
 tamer, who alone feemed able to 
 over-ballance the weight of all other 
 oppofition y and to him he made large 
 advances accordingly; but his of- 
 fers were ftill inadequate to the ex- 
 pedlations of that Demagogue, who, 
 neverthelefs, put on a face of capitu- 
 lation. He was even heard to fay 
 that Yak-ftrot was an honeft man 
 and a good minifter : nay, he declared 
 he would afcend the highefl: pin- 
 nacle of the higheft pagod in Japan, 
 and proclaim that Yak-ftrot had ne- 
 ver, diredtly nor indiredlly, meddled 
 with adminiftration fince he refign- 
 
 ed

 ed the public office of minifter. 
 Finding him, however, tardy and 
 phlegmatic in his propofals, he 
 thought proper to change his phrafe, 
 and in the next aflembly of the peo- 
 ple fwore, with great vociferation, 
 that the faid Yak-flrot was the greateft 
 rogue that ever efcaped the gallows. 
 This was a neceffary fillip to Yak- 
 ftrot,and operated upon him fo efFecflu- 
 ally, that he forthwith fent a charte 
 blanche to the great Taycho, and a 
 treaty was immediately ratified on 
 the following conditions : That the 
 faid Taycho fhould be raifed to the 
 rank of Quanbuku, and be appointed 
 confervator of the Dairo's fignet : 
 that no ftate meafure {hould be taken 
 without his exprefs approbation : 
 that his creature the lawyer PrafF- 
 fog fhould be ennobled and prefer- 
 red to the mofl: eminent place in the 
 tribunals of Japan j and that all his 
 friends and dependants fliould be

 however, was not comprehended in 
 this treaty, the articles of which he 
 inveighed againft with fuch acri- 
 mony, that a rupture enfued betwixt 
 thefe two originals. The truth is, 
 Lob-kob was now fo full of his 
 own importance, that nothing lefs 
 than an equal (hare of adminiflration 
 would fatisfy his ambition 5 and this 
 was neither in Taycho's power nor 
 inclination to grant. 
 
 The firft confequence of this treaty 
 was a new (liift of hands, and a new 
 dance of miniflers. The chair of pre- 
 cedency was pulled from under the 
 antiquated Fika-kaka, who fell upon 
 his back ; and his heels flying up, 
 difcovered but too plainly the melan- 
 choly truth of his m.etamorphofis. 
 Ail his colleagues were difcarded, 
 except thofe who thought proper to

 hay, according as they were a6lu- 
 ated by the new partners of the pup- 
 pet- {hew. This coalition was the 
 greateft mailer-piece in poHtics that 
 ever Yak-flrot performed. Taycho, 
 the formidable Taycho ! whom in 
 his fingle perfon he dreaded more 
 than all his other enemies of Japan 
 united, was now become his coadju- 
 tor, abettor, and advocate; and J which 
 was ftill of more confequence toStrot, 
 that Demagogue was forfiken of hi« 
 good genius Legion. 
 
 The many-headed Mender would 
 have fw alio wed down every other 
 fpecies of tergiverfation in Taycho, 
 except a coalition with the deteiled 
 favourite, and the title of Quo, by 
 which he formally renounced its fo- 
 ciety : but thefe were articles which 
 the mongrel could not digeft. The 
 tidings of this union threw the Beaft 
 into a kind of flupor, from which it

 common hatred to Yak- ft rot, hke the 
 rod of Mofe?, fwallowed up every 
 diftindion of party, and every fug- 
 geftion of former animofity; and 
 they concurred with incredible zeal, 
 in roufing Legion to a due fenfe of 
 Taycho's apoftacy. 7 heBeaft, fo fti- 
 mulatcd, howled three days and three 
 nights fucceflively at Taycho's gate^ 
 then was feized w^ith a convulfion, 
 that went off with an evacuation 
 upwards and downwards, fo ofFen-

 The horrid founds of the Bead's 
 lamentation, the noxious effluvia of 
 its filthy difcharge, joined to the 
 poignant remorfe which Taycho 
 felt at finding his powxr over 
 Legion difiTolved, occafioned a com-

 him into certain extravagancies, 
 which gave his enemies a handle to 
 fay he was actually in fane. His 
 former friends and partizans thought 
 the beft apology they could make for 
 the inconfiflency of his condudt, was 
 to fay he was non compos ; and this 
 report was far from being difagree- 
 able to Yak-ftrot, becaufe it would 
 at any time furnifli him with a plau- 
 fible pretence to diifolve the partner- 
 fliip, at which he inwardly repined : 
 for it was neceflity alone that drove 
 him to a partition of his power Vvith

 and hisBonzeadminiiler inflammatory 
 glyfters -, the monfler could never be 
 brought to a right underflanding, or 
 at all concur with their deligns, ex- 
 cept in one infiance, which was its 
 antipathy to the Ximian favourite. 
 This had become fo habitual, that it 
 adted mechanically upon its organs, 
 even after it had loft ail other figns 
 of recognition. As often as the name 
 of Yak-ftrot was pronounced, the 
 Beaft began to yell \ and all the ufual 
 confequences enfued : but when- 
 ever his new friends prefumed to 
 mount him, he threw himfelf on his 
 back, and rolled them in the kennel 
 at the hazard of their lives.

 who were natives of Niphon ; for how- 
 foever they promifed all fubmiffion 
 to his will before they were admit- 
 ted into his motion, they no fooner 
 found themfelves acfting charafirers in 
 his drama, than they began to thwart 
 him in his meafures ; fo that he was 
 plagued by thofe he had taken in, 
 and perfecuted by thofe he had driven 
 out. The two great props which he 
 had been at fo much pains to pro- 
 vide, now failed him. Taycho was 
 grown crazy, and could no longer 
 manage the monfter ; and Quam-ba- 
 cundono the Fatzman, whofe autho- 
 rity had kept feveral puppets in awe, 
 died about this period. Thefe two 
 circumflances were the more alarm- 
 ing, as Gotto-mio and his crew be- 
 gan to gain ground, not only in their 
 endeavours to roufe the Monfter, but 
 alfo in tampering with fome of ther 
 afting puppets, to join their cabal

 Thefe exoterics grew fo refradory, 
 that when he tried to wheel them to 
 the right, they turned to the left 
 about ; and, inilead of joining hands 
 in the dance of politics, rapped their 
 heads againfl each -other with fuch 
 violence, that the noife of the colli- 
 lion was heard in the flreet; and if 
 they had not been made of the hard- 
 ell: wood, in Japan, fome of them 
 would certainly have been fplit in 
 the encounter. 
 
 By this time Legionbegan to have 
 fome itwiQ of its own miferable condi- 
 tion . The efTed:s of the ycaft potions 
 which it had drank fo liberally from 
 th6 hands of Taycho, now wore ofF. 
 The fumes difperfed; the illufion va- 
 nifhed^ the flatulent tumor of its bel- 
 ly difappeared with innumerable ex- 
 plofions, leaving a hideous lanknefs 
 and fuch a canine appetite as all the 
 eatables of Japan could not fatisfy.

 After having devoured the whole 
 harveft, it yav^ned for more, and 
 grew quite outrageous in its hunger, 
 threatening to feed on human flefh, 
 if not plentifully fupplied with other 
 viands. In this dilemma Yak-llrot 
 convened the council of Twenty- 
 Eight, where, in confideration of the 
 urgency of the cafe, it was refolved 
 to fufpend the law againft the im- 
 portation of foreign proviiions, and 
 open the ports of Japan for the relipf 
 of the blatant Bead. 
 
 As this was veiling the Dairo 
 with a difpeniing power unknown 
 to the conftitutlon of Japan, it was 
 thought neceflary at the next aflem- 
 bly of the Quos and Quanbukus that 
 conftitute the legiflature, to obtain a 
 legal fandlion for that extraordinary 
 exercife of prerogative, which notliing 
 but the j^^/z/j-^^^z//i could excufe. Up- 
 on this occafion it was diverting to 
 fee with v/hat effrontery individuals 
 
 I 6 changed

i8a "the Hijiory and 
 
 changed their principles with their 
 places. Taycho the Quo, happen-* 
 ing to be in one of his lucid inter- 
 vals, went to the affembly, fupport- 
 cd by his two creatures PrafF-fog, 
 and another limb of the law, called 
 Lley-nah., furnamed Gurg-grog, or 
 Curfe-mother 5 and this triumvirate, 
 who had raifed themfelves from no- 
 thing to the firfl: rank in the ftate, by 
 vilifying and infulting the kingly 
 .power, and affirming that the Dairo 
 was the flave of the people, now had 
 the impudence to declare in the face 
 of day, that in fome cafes the empe- 
 ror*s power was abfolute, and that 
 he had an inherent right to fufpend 
 and fuperfede the laws and ordinances 
 of the legiflature. 
 
 Mura-clami, whohad been for fome 
 time eclipfed in his judicial capacity 
 by the popularity of PrafF-fog, did 
 not fail tofeizethis opportunity of ex- 
 pofing the charafter of his upftart rival.

 Though he had been ail his life an 
 humble retainer to the prerogative, 
 he now made a parade of patriotifm, 
 and in a tide of eloquence bore down 
 all the flimfy arguments which the 
 triumvirate advanced. He demon- 
 ftrated the futility of their reafoning, 
 from the exprefs laws and cuftoms 
 of the empire; he expatiated on the 
 pernicious tendency of their dodlrine, 
 and exhibited the inconfiflency of 
 their conduct in fuch colours^ that 
 they mufl: have hid their heads in 
 confufion, had they not happily con- 
 quered all fenfe of fliame^ and been 
 well convinced f^hat the majority of 
 the affembly were not a whit more 
 honeft than themfelves. Mura-cla- 
 mi enjoyed a momentary triumph ; 
 but his words made a very flight 
 impreflion ; for it was his misfor- 
 tune to be a Ximian; and if his vir- 
 tues had been more numerous than

 the hairs in his beard, this very cir- 
 cumftance would have fhaved them 
 clean away from the confideration 
 of the audience. 
 
 Taycho, opening the flood-gates of 
 his abufe, befpattsred all that oppofed 
 him. Lleynah, alias Curfe-mother, 
 fwore that he had got into the wrong- 
 box; then turning to Praff- fog, **Bro- 
 ther PraflF, (cried he) thou haft now 
 let down thy trowfers, and every 
 rafcal in Japan will whip thy a — fe!" 
 PrafF was afraid of the Beaft's re- 
 fentment : but Tavcho beftrid him 
 like a ColoiTus, and he crept through 
 between his legs into a place of 
 fafety. This was the laft time that 
 the Orator appeared in public. Im- 
 mediately after this occurrence it 
 was found necefiary to confine him 
 to a dark chamber, and Yak-ftrot 
 was left to his own inventions. 
 
 In this dilemma he had recourfe 
 
 to

 to the old expedient of changing 
 hands -, and as a prelude to this re- 
 form, made advances to Gotto-mio, 
 whom he adually detached from the 
 oppofition, by providing his friends 
 and dependants with lucrative offices, 
 and promifing to take no fteps of con- 
 fequence without his privity and ap- 
 probation . A fop was at the fame time 
 thrown to Twitz-er; Zan-ti-fic, lul- 
 led with fpecious promifes, difcarded 
 Toks the incendiary Bonze; Lob-kob 
 figned a neutrality, andold.Fika-kaka 
 was deprived of the ufe of fpeech : 
 — in a word, the ill-cemented con- 
 federacy of Strot's exoteric foes fell 
 afunder ; and Legion had now no 
 rage but the rage of hunger to be 
 appeafed. But the Ximian favourite 
 w^as dill thwarted in his operations 
 behind the curtain ; for he had fo 
 often chopped and changed the 
 figures that compofed his motion,

 that they were all of different ma- 
 terials ; fo wretchedly forted and fo 
 ill-toned, that when they came up- 
 on the fcene, they produced nothing 
 but difcord and diforder. 
 
 The Japonefe colony of Fatfifio 
 had been fettled above a century, 
 and in the face of a thoufand dangers 
 and difficulties raifed themfelves to 
 fuch confideration, that they con- 
 fumed infinite quantities of the ma* 
 nufadlures of Japan, for which they 
 payed their m.other-country in gold 
 and filver, and precious drugs, the 
 produce of their plantations. The 
 advantages which Japan reaped from 
 this traffic with her own cclonifts, 
 almoft equalled the amount of what 
 {he gained by her commerce with all 
 the other parts of Afia. Twitz-er, 
 when he managed the finances of Ja- 
 pan, had in his great wifdom plan- 
 ned, procured, and pronmilgated a

 law faddling the Fatfifians with a 
 grievous tax to anfwer the occa- 
 lions of the Japonefe government ; 
 an impofition which ftruck at the 
 very vitals of their conftitution, by 
 which they were exempt from all 
 burthens but fuch as they fitted for 
 their own ihoulders. They raifed 
 a mighty clamour at this innovation, 
 in which they were joined by Le- 
 gion, at that time under the influ- 
 ence of Taycho, who, in the affem- 
 bly of the people, bitterly inveighed 
 againft the authors and abettors of 
 fuch an arbitrary and tyrannical 
 meafure. Their reproach and exe- ^ 
 cration did not flop at Twitz-er, 
 but proceeded, as ufual, to Yak-ftrot, 
 who was the general butt at which 
 all the arrows of flander, fcurrility> 
 and abufe, were levelled. The pup-^

 felves to Legion, and perhaps, with 
 a view to mortify the favourite, who 
 had patronized the Fatfifian tax, in- 
 fifted upon withdrawing this impo- 
 fitioH;, which was accordingly abro- 
 gated, to the no fmall difgrace and 
 contempt of the law-givers : but 
 when thefe new minifters were turn- 
 ed out, to make way for Taycho and 
 his friends, the intereft of the Fat- 
 fifians was again abandoned. Even 
 the Orator himfelf declaimed againfl 
 them with an unembarraffed counte- 
 nance, after they had raifed ftatues 
 to him as their friend and patron ; 
 and meafures were taken to make 
 them feel all the feverity of an ab- 
 je(fl dependance upon the legiflature 
 of Japan, Finally, Gotto-mio ac- 
 ceded to this fyflem, which he had 
 formerly approved in conjunction 
 with Twitz-er^ and preparations

 fufe to fubmit with a good grace. 
 - The Fatfiiians, far from ac- 
 quiefcing in thefe proceedings, re- 
 folved to defend to the laft extre- 
 mity thofe liberties which they had 
 hitherto preferved j and, as a proof 
 of their independence, agreed among 
 themfelves to renounce all the fuper- 
 fluities with which they had fo long 
 been furnifhed, at a vaft expence, 
 from the manufadurcs of Japan, 
 fince that nation had begun to ad: 
 towards them with all the cruelty of 
 a flep-mother. It was amazing to fee 
 and to hear how Legion raved, and 
 llabbered, and fnapped its multitu- 
 dinous jaws in the flreets of Meaco, 
 when it underftood that the Fatii-* 
 fians were determined to live on 
 what their own country afforded. 
 They were reprefented and reviled

 ielves the expence of thofe fuper- 
 fiuiLies, which, by the bye, her cruel 
 impofitions had left them no money 
 to purchafe. Nothing was heard in 
 Japan but threats of puniihing thofe 
 ungrateful colonifts with whips and 
 fcorpions. For this purpofe troops were 
 aflembled and fleets equipped ; and 
 the blatant BeafI: yawned with impa- 
 tient expectation of being drenched 
 with the blood of its feIlow-fubjeds< 
 Yak-ftrot was feized with hor^ 
 ror at the profped: of fuch ex- 
 tremities \ for, to give the devil 
 his due, his difpofition was neither 
 arbitrary nor cruel ; but he had been 
 hurried by evil counfellors into a 
 train of falfe politics, the confe- 
 quences pf which he did not fore-

 fee. He now fummoned council 
 after council to deliberate upon 
 conciliatory expedients ; but found 
 the motley crew fo divided by felf- 
 intereft, fadion, and mutual rancour, 
 that no confiftent plan could be 
 formed : all was nonfenfe, clamour, 
 and contradidtion. The Ximian 
 favourite now wifhed all his puppets 
 at the devil, and fecretly curfed the 
 hour in which he firft undertook 
 the motion. He even fell lick of 
 chagrin, and refolved, in good ear- 
 neft, to withdraw himfelf intire- 
 ly from the political helm, which 
 he was now convinced he had no 
 talents to guide. In the mean 
 time, he tried to find fome tem- 
 porary alleviation to the evils oc- 
 cafioned by the monflrous incon- 
 gruity of the members and ma- 
 terials that compofed his admini- 
 ftration. But before any effedlual 
 
 meafures

 meafures could be taken, his evil ge- 
 nius, ever adlive, brewed up a new

 had well-nigh fwept him and all 
 his projects into the gulph of 
 perdition.
