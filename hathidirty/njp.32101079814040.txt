gPAIN has given birth to so
many eminent Painters, of
whom there is no memorial in the
rest of Europe, and abounds with
so many admirable examples of
d| their art, dispersed in churches,
convents and palaces, where the

ly carries them, that I persuade

myself it will not be unacceptable
to the public to have some ac-
count of men and works so little
known and yet so highly worthy
to be recorded. I am not aware
that this has been professedly at-
tempted by any Spanish writer,
except by Palomino; who in an
elaborate treatise on the Art of
Painting, in two folio volumes,
has inserted the lives of two hun-
dred and thirty-three Painters and
Sculptors, who florished in Spain
from the time of Ferdinand the
Catholic to the conclusion of the
reign of Philip the Fourth of these
materials I have principally availed
myself in the following sheets, but
not without due attention to other

particulars, which he has failed to
enumerate. He is said to have
Written with a competent know-
ledge of his subject, as an art, of
which he was himself a professor;
and in rules for the practice of
painting he is very diffusive: If
he had been more communicative
or entertaining in those matters,
for which I chiefiy consulted him,
I might have needed less apology
for the present publication: Many
particulars however have been
furnished to me from tradition*
which help out the sterility and
dryness of his catalogue; and I
must not omit to acknowledge the
assistance I drew from the treatise

-extremely rare and hardly to be
obtained. I know there was an
Engliih abridgement of Palomi-
no's Painters published in the year
1739, but the original is in very
few hands; so that, unless some
Spanish biographer shall speedily
be found with public spirit to en-
gage in the task of rescuing the
fame of his ingenious country-
men from approaching extinction,
their histories at least will soon be
lost, whatever may be the. fate of
their works. The world is in pos-
session of many memoirs of the ar-
tists of Italy, France and Flan-
ders; and the Painters, who dis-
tinguished themselves in England,
have by happy fortune found a
. biographer, whose entertaining ta-
lents

Vents will secure to them a recep-
tion with posterity; whilst of alt
the Painters, to whose memory I
have dedicated this flight at-
tempt, scarce a name is heard
without the limits of Spain, ex-
cept those of Velasquez, Murillo,
and Ribeira: The paintings of the
latter it- is true are very gene-
rally known, many excellent per-
formances of his being dispersed
through Europe: Some respecta-
ble remains of Velasquez are to be
found in Italy, but the principal
exertions of his pencil were reser-
ved for his own country, and the
Sovereign, who entertained him in
his service; these, we may natu-
rally suppose, can never be ex-
tracted: And as for Murillo, al-
, B 3 though

though some pieces of his have in
time past been extracted from Se-
ville, yet I think I may venture to
fay, that not many of them, which
pass under his name, are legiti-
mate; and in a less proportion
can we find amongst such,. as are
true. pictures, any of so capital a
rank, as to impart a competent
idea of his extraordinary merit.
The candid reader will observe,
that I do not profess to give the
Lives of the Painters, who are
treated of in this catalogue, for
which my materials do not suffice;
nor shall I hazard many criticisms
upon their respective works, for
which more science would be re-
quisite than I can pretend to; still
I hope there will be found suffi-

cient novelty to amuse such of
my readers, as can endure to hear
of paintings, as they strike the
feelings of an ordinary observer,
-without presuming to dissect them
in the learned jargon of a Virtuoso:
It will be remembered therefore
that I offer nothing more to the
public than Anecdotes of the
Eminent Painters, who have flo-
rifhed in Spain during the two
centuries last past; and in this de-
scription I include all such illus-
trious foreigners, as have resorted
to Spain for the display of their
talents under protection of the
Princes or Nobles of that king-
dom; these are a pretty numerous
class, and in treating of them I
shall study to avoid repeating

what may have been better told
by others; but even of these per-
haps some local anecdotes will
occur, which may at least be sup-
plementary to the accounts al-
ready in existence. My residence
in Spain, and some advantages in-
cident to my peculiar situation
there, gave me repeated access to
every thing I wished to see; al-
most every religious foundation
throughout the kingdom contains
a magazine of art; in resorting to
these nothing will be found, of
which a stranger can complain,
unless of the gloominess of some
of the edifices, and the unfavour-
able lights, in which many capi-
tal paintings are disposed: In pri-
vate houses it is not unusual lo

discover very fine pictures in neg-
Ject and decay; thrown aside
amongst the rubbish of cast-osf
furniture; whether it be, that the
.possessor has no knowledge of
their excellence, or thinks it be-
low his notice to attend to their
preservation; but how much so-
ever the Spaniards have declined
-from their former taste and pas-
sion for the elegant arts, I. am
persuaded they have in no degree
fallen off from their national cha-
racter-for generosity, which is still
so prevalent amongst them, that

posed to .avail .himself of their
munificence, may in a great
measure obtain whatever is the
object of his praise and admira-

tion: As for the royal collections
at Madrid, the Escorial and else-
where, he will meet a condescen-
sion so accommodated to his cu-
riosity, that the one is as little
likely to be exhausted as the
other; the facility of access to
every palace in possession of His
Catholic Majesty is only to be
equalled by the gratification it
produces.
The Arts, which revived in
Italy during the 14th century,
did not reach Spain till the time
of Ferdinand the Catholic; Antonio
"Del Rincon, a native of Guadalax-
ara,

<page 24>
[ » ]
ara, may be considered as the fa-
ther of the Spanish school; he
studied in Rome, and, returning
to his native country, was taken
into the service of Ferdinand-, who
bestowed on him the Order of
Santiago, and made him Groom of
his Chamber. There are two por-
traits of Ferdinand and Isabella,
painted by him, still to be seen at
'Toledo, in the church of San Juan
de los Reyes, and several pictures
by his hand perished in the fire,
that destroyed the palace of the
Pardo-m the year 1608. This ar-
tist died in the year 1500. h
The unhappy catastrophe of
Torrigiano., the Florentine, follow-
ed in the year 1522: After having
enriched the cities of Andalusia
with

<page 25>
[ " ]
with several pieces of sculpture,
not unworthy the disciple and ri-
val of Michael Angelo, he was
condemned to death by the In-
quisition, and expired in the pri-
son of Seville under the horrors of
an approaching execution: The
story is as follows; 'Torrigiano had
undertaken to carve a Madona
and child of the natural size, at the
order of a certain Spanish Gran-
dee; it was to be made after the
model of one, which he had al-
ready executed; and promise was
given him of a reward propor-
tioned to the merit of his - work.
His employer was one of the first
Grandees of Spain, and Torrigi-
ano, who conceived highly of his
generosity, and well knew what
his

<page 26>
[ *3 ]
his own talents could perform,
was determined to outdo his for-
mer work 5 he had passed great
part of his life in travelling from
kingdom to kingdom in search of
employment, and, flattering him-
self with the hope, that he had
now at last found a resting-place
after all his labours, the ingenious
artist with much pains and appli-
cation compleated the work, and
presented to his employer a
matchless piece of sculpture, the
utmost effort of his art; the Gran-
dee surveyed the striking perfor-
mance with great delight and re-
verence; applauded Torrigiano to
the skies; and, impatient to pos-
sess himself of the enchanting
idol, forthwith sent to demand it;
at

<page 27>
[ 14 ]
at the same time, to set off his
generosity with a better display,
he loaded two lacqueys with the
money, that was to defray the
purchase the bulk at least was
promising, but when Torrigiano
turned out the bags, and found
the specie nothing better than a
parcel of brass maravedi, amount-
ing only to the paltry sum of thir-
ty ducats, vexation at this sudden
disappointment of his hopes, and
just resentment for what he con-
sidered as an insult to his merit,
so transported him, that, snatch-
ing up his mallet in a rage, and
-not regarding the perfections or

consequence) the sacred character

broke it suddenly in pieces, and
dismissed the lacqueys with their
load of farthings to tell the tale:
They executed their errand too
well. The Grandee in his turn
fired with siiame, vexation and
revenge, and assuming, or per-
haps conceiving, horror for the
sacrilegious nature of the act:, pre-
sented himself before the Court
of Inquisition, and impeached the
unhappy artist: at that terrible tri-
bunal; it was in vain that poor
Torrigiano urged the right of an
author over his own creation;
Reason pleaded on his side, but
Superstition fate in judgement; the
decree was death with torture.
The Holy Office lost its victim; for

rat's, not under the hands of the
executioner: That he was of a
fierce impatient spirit we may
well believe from what is related
of his maiming the great Michael
Angela by a violent blow on the
face; the heretical reader perhaps
will think this blow a more in-
excusable, offence, than that, for
which he suffered; and an enthu-
siast in the arts will scarce lament
the punishment, which by a just
transition fell upon him; for my
part, I lament both his offence
and his punishment; the man,
who could be so frantie with pas-
sion, as in the person of Michael
Angela to deface one of the di-
vinest works of heaven, might
easily be tempted to demolish his
own;

own; and it has been generally"
observed, that heartsr so prone to
anger, have on occasion been as
susceptible of apprehension and
fear; it is. to be supposed, that
Torrigiano's case was not better in
the eyes of the Holy Osfice for his
having been resident in England
and employed by King Henry the
Eighth: Whether they considered
him as tinctured with the heresy
of that Royal apostate does not ap-
pear; I am inclined to believe he
more resembled Henry in temper
than in opinion: At least, if we.
are to credit his. assault on Michael
Angela and try him on that ac-
tion; since the days of Diomed
few mortals ever launched a more
impious blow.

planted from Italy into Spain,
found a ready naturalization in a
country, then abounding with ge-
nius: The province of Andalu-
sia took the lead on this occasion,
and has in all times been produc-
tive of extraordinary talents; it
was the cradle of most of the Spa-
nish painters; it's natives conti-
nue to be remarked for quick and
volatile parts, disfering much in
manners and disposition from the
Castilians. Certain it is that Spain
has many local qualifications for
becoming a nursery of Painters,
which other countries are in want
of: It enjoys a clear and vivid Iky,

the human countenance there is in
general of a grave historical cast;
the intermixture of the Jewish and
Mooristi tribes have marked the
lower classes with a strong peculi-
arity of features; the forms of the
children, till they attain the age
of eight or ten, are good, and of-
tentimes their faces beautiful;
the eyes of the women black and
piercing, and, as they use much
action when they converse, and are
universally addicted to the Moor-
ish modes of dancing, which al-
most every peasant can accom-

male is uncommonly antique and

folded twenty different ways for
different applications, and each
attitude presents a specimen of
drapery worthy the study of an
academy. The Painters have a-
vailed themselves of this,. Italians
as well as natives, and the Capa
will be found frequently upon
their canvasses, even where the
scene does not lie in Spain. In
speaking of Spain, as a country
favourable to Painters, I think it
is just to except painters of land-
scapes; in these it has neither ex-
celled nor abounded; and the ee-
neral want of trees and verdure

tions, emblematic of rural tranquil-
lity, which furnish the most pleas-

spread; the face of Nature is
adust and frowning.
The Emperor Charles, though
not very cordially attached to his
Spanish subjects, nor over partial
to their country, cultivated not-
withstanding the genius of their
Painters; and this he effected not
only by sending them to study
under-the Italian masters, but also

Juan de Udine, a disciple #f Ra-

a royal work, the beautifying the

riched the Hospital of Santiago, in
the city of Ubeda, with many no^.
ble paintings, and the famous
Duke of Alva found employment
for their talents.

in the theory of his art, he exhi-
bited to the world a new system
of human symmetry and propor-
tion, disfering at once from the
rules of Pomponio Gaurieo, Philips
de Borgona and Alberto Durero,
over whom he finally triumphed
both in principle and practice;
leaving many illustrious monu-
ments of his excellence in all the
branches of his study, both at
Madrid, the Pardo and the Al- -
hambra of Grenada; for which he
was suitably honoured and re-
warded by the Emperor Charles,
and died full of years and replete
with. fame and fortune, in 1545/'
in the city of Madrid. I should
observe in this place, that in the

an encouragement to others, and
the school of Michael Angelo was
eagerly resorted to by Baptist*
Bergamo and Gafpar Becerrd, of
Baize ml Andalusia; these illustri-
ous students returned together to
Spain, and were immediately tak-
en into the protection of the Em-

these commissions to the satisfac-

they had equipped his images in
wide hoops and furbelowed petti-
coats, they applauded the artist,
and adored his manufacture. It
was not so easy to satisfy the ca-
price of Isabella of Valois; she'
commissioned him to carve a
wooden image of our Lady of the
Solidad, for the convent of San
Francisco de Paulo; Becerra re-
ceived her Majesty's commands,

presented it to the Queen with an-
assurance of success, but in vain;
his image did not reach the ideas
of the Queen; the expression did
not please her; and he was com-
manded not only to make a bet-
ter, but to take less time in mak-
ing it: He executed his order a
second time, and produced an,
image to the admiration of all
beholders; even the Fathers of
the Convent acknowledged it to
be a perfect and exact repreftnta-
- tion of nature; it was again sub-
mitted to the Queen, and again
condemned for falling short of
her Majesty's conceptions of our
Lady of the Solidad; the unhappy
artist was threatened to be super-

abler master; but, anxious to pre-
serve his pre-eminence, and ful-
fil her Majesty's ideas, he again
applied himself with ardour to the
task; he racked his imagination
without ceasing to frame some vi-
sage, and devise some form, that
Isabella might confess bore a re-
semblance to the image in her
mind: Wearied out with the tor-
menting investigation, the ex-
hausted artist one day fell into a
profound sleep; whilst this was
passing, he saw, or thought he saw,
a feimale figure presenting herself

out of bed, and take the log, that
he would find burning on his
hearth, and set to- work upon it,
and he would find an image to his
mind; Becerray overjoyed, lost no-
time in following her advice; he
found the log, quenched it; 'twas
a convenient piece of timbeF; and
with this supernatural aid Com-
pleated a figure to the heart's
content of Isabella; the Monks,
whose prayers assisted the execu-
tion, received the miraculous
image with joy; it was erected

is to be seen) but of his pa-
tience; and proves, that, however
eminent might be his talent for
sculpture, if it had not been
for his faculty of dreaming, he
would have made a shameful
shipwreck of his fame. Happy
had it been for poor Torrigiano,
if he had had Becerra's discretion,
or Becerra's dreams.

the other of Salamanca) were

particularly the latter; they for-
med themselves in the school of
Alberto Durero, and Gallegos co-
pied the manner of his master so
closely, that many of his pictures
cannot be distinguished from £)a«

at Salamanca, but most of them
so impaired by time, and by the
cloister where they hang, that
they are become scarce visible.
Charles the Vth also brought with
him into Spain, out of Italy, the
celebrated Pedro Campana, a Fle-
ming by birth, who had studied
twenty years in the school of Ra-
fael Urbin: When Charles made
his entry into Bologna, in the year
1530, Pedro Campana devised the
grand triumphal arch, under
■ f. ,;. which

after came into Spain, resid-
ing chiefly at Seville. In the

city there is still to be seen a ca-
pital painting by this master on.
the subject of the ceremony, to.
which the chapel is dedicated; a.
Descent from the Cross and a Nati-
vity, both celebrated pictures, are.
yet to be seen in the church of
San Lorenzo; and in the convent
of San Pablo, in a. small chapel
adjoining to the Chapter-house,,
there is a picture by Campana on
the subject of the Circumcision;
all which are much extolled by
Pacheco in his treatise on the Art
os Painting. Campana died in the
year -1570 at Brussels* where his

It was this visit made by theEm-
peror Charles to Bologna in 1530,
which brought about an event of
the first importance in the history
of the arts in Spain; I mean the
introduction of the works of Titi-
ano, and some time after of Titiano
himself; that great master was in
Bologna, when Charles made his
entry, and like Charles was then
in the full lustre of his fame;
scarce a character of eminence in
Europe, but was to be found on
the canvass of Titiano to be de-
livered to posterity in the glowing
colours of his pencil seemed an
object of general ambition, and
in some degree an anticipation

he passed through that city in the
year above mentioned; he was in
the meridian of life and, though
he could not be said to inherit the

beauty of Philip the Handsome, he
was nevertheless of a majestic
comely aspect; the portrait pleased
him well and, though so weak an
ingredient as vanity was not to be
found in Charles's composition,
yet he was not insensible to im-
pressions, and henceforward deter-
mined never to commit his person
to any other limner than fitiano.
He was a lover of arts, not an en-
thusiast; he knew the force of
their effects, and reverenced them
for their power, without being
captivated by their charms; to
men of eminence he was liberal
without familiarity; in short, his
affections in this particular, as in
every other, were directed regu-
larly to their object by reason, not
driven impetuously by constitution

or passion: Upon this principle he
rewarded "Titiano for his portrait
with a thousand golden scudi,
consulting thereby no less his own
magnificence, than the artist's
merit; he paid him 200 ducats
for a small piece; and, upon Titi-
ano's presenting him with a pic-
tureof the Annunciation, forwhich
his countrymen the Venetians
had refused to pay him more than
aoo scudi, Charles rewarded him
for the present with a thousand. He
invited *Fitiano into Spain, and
pressed him to comply, using many
promises and some in treaties; anx-
ious to wrest the palm of glory
from the brows of his rival Fran-
sis in arts, as well as arms, he
perceived there was no other living
merit

merit but afrwwe's, which he could
oppose to that of Leonardo da Vinci.
Carlos Rodolfi, the biographer of
Titiano, says he never came into
Spain, but he is mistaken; it war-
not however till the year 154S
that he complied with the Empe-
ror's invitation; from that period
till 1553 he resided in Spain; dur^.
ing this residence he composed
many admirable works? and re-
ceived many princely rewards^
Charles gave him the key, the
order of Santiago at Brussels, and
in 1553 constituted him a Count
Palatine of the empire at Barcelona.

These favours alarmed the jealou-
sy of the nobles both of Germany and
Spain, but their envy drew no other
answer from Charles, than that he
had many nobles in his empire and
hut one Titiano; the artist, who was
at some distance, employed upon
a picture, overheard the retort
with conscious satisfaction and-,
as he made his reverence to the
Emperor, dropt a pencil on the
floor; the courteous monarch
took it up and, delivering it tp

him confounded by this second
mark of his condescension, added,
that to wait on Titiano was a ser-
vice for an Etoperor. Charles did
not only grace this eminent ar-
tist with the splendid ornaments
and titles above mentioned, he
gave him more solid marks of
his favour, appointing him rents
in Naples of two hundred ducats
annually each, besides a munifi-
cent compensation for every pic-
ture he executed: Palomino says,
that Charles regarded the posses-
sion of a capital piece of Titiano
more than he did the acquisition
of a new province to his domi-
nion; but Palomino was a painter,
and more familiar with the pic-
tures of Titiano, than with the po-
"-*litica

<page 55>
[ 42 ]
lltics of the Emperor : This would
have been a caprice unworthy of
any prince; but Charles's charac-
ter was not the sport of caprice;
whilst to the very moment.of his
life, when he resigned his domi-
nions, it was evident that ambi-
tion was his ruling passion; had
he been capable of that preference,
which Palomino ascribes to him, he
would hardly have taken such pains
to the last hour of his reign to
persuade his brother Ferdinand to
make a sacrisice of his succession
of the empire, nor have retired
into the unfurnished cell of his
convent with his puppets and his
birds without one consolatory re-
membrance of his favourite author
to cheer his solitude, or to enflame
» . his

[ 43 ]
his devotion: I can hardly be
persuaded, that Charles's abdica-
tion of his empire was any proof
of caprice; he plainly enough
perceived his health was gone, and
he was not willing that his fame
should follow it.
Titiano had quitted Spain, be-
fore Philip took possession of the
throne; the arts however had
rapidly advanced: Charles had
made some improvement to the
royal edisices, but all with a view
to accommodation rather than
magnificence; he had fronted the
old palace of Madrid, beautified
and repaired the venerable Al-
hambra of Grenada, planted and
disposed the walks and avenues of
Aranjuez in the Flemish taste,
and

and built the Pardo at two league's
distance from the capital in a
retired situation and in a stile by
no means imperial; it is a square
building of moderate dimensions,
flanked with four small towers at
the angles, and environed with a
fofs exactly on the scale of a no-
bleman's feat in his native coun-
try: Superstition soon engaged
Philip in a more important un-
dertaking and, having made a
vow upon the victory of St. Quin-
tin to dedicate a church and mo-
nastery to San Lorenzo, he began
in the midst of a solitary and
frightful desart to displace the
rocks and compel them to take
the shape of an edifice: on the
feast-day of St. George with much
temporal

laid the foundation-stone of the
monastery of San Lorenzo, called
the Escorialj with the following
inscription:

So much has been said on the
subject of this extraordinary edi-
fice, and the Spanish writers make
such a pompous display of its
magnificence, that I might appear
to affect a singularity of opinion,
if I was to offer freely what my

the matter; to such of my readers,
as have seen the Escorial,. what
I should have to say would have
little novelty; and in their opinions,
who have not seen it, and been
taught to respect it, it might have
too much. The scale undoubtedly
is magnisicent, though the mass
is graceless; as a monastery it is
vast and aweful, sitly calculated
to entomb the living and the
dead; as a palace, k is justly em-
blematic of its founder, who on
the summit of the superincum-
bent mountain was accustomed
to sit and survey his rising fabric
in silent contemplation and de-
light. Francisco de los Santos,

serves that the sensation, which a
spectator feels upon entering the
great.court, is the fame as at sud-
denly hearing a delightful concert;
the soul, says he, in both cases is
absorbed in extajy—what then must
have been the sensations of Phi-
lip, as he fate upon the top of the
mountain, where at one glance he
took in the whole birds-eye of the
edifice? Certainly, if the good Fa-
ther heard a concert upon his en-
tering only one of the courts of
the monastery, His Catholic Ma-
jesty, when stationed on the moun-
tain, must have enjoyed a full cho-
rus of musical extafy: For my

of the Saint above mentioned: He
also took. the pious precaution of

any other injury: These holy pre-
servatives have not been very suc-
cessful in their office, for great part
of the edifice, with not a few of
the relics in charge, were con-
sumed by a dreadful conflagration:

marks on this picture by observ-
ing, that all the harmonious ac-

It is not to be understood that

in the royal collection, were paint-

painter to Charles and to Philip:
Many are of his earlier and better1
age, and were either presented to-
the Crown, or purchased in Italy

the sacristy of the Escorial a San
Sebastian in his best manner, which
was given by the Cende de Bena-
vente, and several pieces of Titiano
were collected by the great paint-
er Velazquez in his excursion to
Italy by order of Philip the IVth.
Whilst Philip the lid. was thus
solicitous to enrich his royal con-
vent of San Lorenzo with the va-
luable works of 'Titiano, extracted
out of Italy, his own kingdom of
Spain osfered to his choice many

of contemporary genius, rouse-s!
into action by the study of his
brilliant compositions, as well as
by the introduction of other dis-
tinguished foreigners, engaged in,
compleating and adorning that
vast fabric, operated to product
an Augustan age in Spain. I shall
proceed to name some of the prin-
cipal painters, as well foreigners
as natives, who were employed in
furnishing and adorning the Esco-
rial.
Juan Fernandez Ximenez of Na-
varre, commonly called El Mudo
or the Dumb, and generally acknow-
ledged as the Titiano of Spain, was
born at Logrono, of a respectable
family; the defects of nature (for
he was deaf as well as dumb)
F j were

<page 83>
C 7o J
-Were in some degree compensated
to him by most quick and brilliant
sense in the remaining faculties.
He was first instructed in the art
of painting by Fray Vicente de
Santo Domingo, a monk of Santa
Catatina in a convent at Talavera
in Castile, of the order of Geronir
mytes; his early marks of genius
were such, that Fray Vkente pro-
posed to the parents of El Mudo
to fend him into Italy, which be-
ing accordingly done, he travelled
to Florence, Venice, Milan and
Naples, visiting many of the most
famous academies -, but princi-
pally forming himself in the school
. of Titiano: He soon established so
. general a reputation in Italy, that
Philip, being apprized of his fam?,
recalled

<page 84>
t 7- }
recalled him into Spain and ap-
pointed him one of his painters at
the Escorial; after having given
some sketches of Prophets in black
and white, in the adornments of
the sacristy, as samples of his
art, he proceeded to compositions
of greater consequence, and paint-
ed the. Baptism of our Saviour in
die Prior's cell; he was after that
employed in several paintings for
a-chapel, which King Philip caused
to be erected in the wood of Se-
govia; these paintings- were- re-
moved to . the upper cloyster of the
Escorial,. and in one of these,
which represents the beheading of
Santiago, El Mudo has inserted
the portrait of Santoyo in the char
raster of the Executioner, in re-
F 4 venge

<page 85>
[ 72 3
verige for some ill offices, which
that minister had done him. San~
toyb complained to the King,
making suit that the figure might
be expunged, and his person not
delivered to posterity in the dis-
graceful occupation of a hangman;
the King, who probably knew the
cause of the osfence, did not dis-
approve of the nature of the re-
venge, and, excusing himself to
Santoyo on account of the excel-
lence of the performance, would
not; allow the picture to be defaced.
The Twelve Apostles on the great
pillars of the church next to the
high altar are also painted by El
Mudo. When Titiano's famous
painting of the Last Supper arrived
at the Efcorial, El Mudo was em-
ployed,

<page 86>
t 73 3
ployed, and upon Philip's propos-
ing to cut the canvass to the size of
the pannel in the refectory, where
it was destined to hang, El Mudo
to prevent the mutilation of so ca-
pital a wotIc made earnest signs
of intercession with the King to be
permitted to copy it, and reduce
it to the size of the place allotted,
osfering to do it in the space of six
months; upon the King's expres-
sing a hesitation on account of
the length of the time required by
El Mudo for the work, and pro-
ceeding to put his design in exe-
cution, El Mudo repeated his sup-
plications in behalf of his favour-
ite master with more fervency than
ever, osfering to compleat his copy
in less time, than he at first de-
manded)

<page 87>
E 74 J
manded, tendering at the- same
time his head, as the punishment
of non-compliance,. laying his
hand on his. breast as a sign, that
he claimed the order of Santiago
as his reward if he should succeed j
the offer was not accepted and
execution. was performed upon T.i-
tiano, accompanied with the most -
distressful attitudes and distortions
of El Mudo. He died.soon after
at the Escorial to the great regret
of Philip, at the age of 40, in the
year 1572, generally, intitled the
%itiano of Spaing and was honourr
ed with an epitaph by Fra. Lops
Feliz de Vega Carpo.
El Divine Morales was born at
Badajoz in the province of ,Estre-
.madura, in the beginning of the
- - sixteenth

<page 88>
[ m i
sixteenth: century. He was, in-
structed at Seville in the academy
of Pedro Campana, a; disciple of
. Raphael from his constant choice
of divine subjects and the ex-
treme delicacy of his pencil he
acquired the appellation of El: JDi-.
vina, and is. known to the present
age by no other name than that of
El Divino Morales. All his paint-
ings are upon board or copper,
* and almost generally heads of the
crucisied Saviour; no instance oc-
curring of his having executed
any composition or figure at full
length. His heads are finished osf
with infinite care and laboured to
- . -
the utmost, yet not so as to dimi-
nish the force of the expression;
for I have.seen some examples of
7 his

<page 89>
i 76 ]
his Ecce Homo of a most exquisite
and touching character; also some
heads of the Christ bearing the
cross approaching very near to the
Saviour in the famous Pa/mo de
Sicilia. Though Morales never fails
to impress the countenance with

I. never met with any instance of
his doing violence to our ideas of
the divinity of the object he re-

and his own, more resembling
however the face of the Christ in
Raphael's picture above-mention-
ed, than any other; and worked,
as it appears to me, after the man-
ner of the highly-finished heads of
Leonardo da Vinsu He was un-

obscure I have sometimes found
him evidently deficients nor has
he any tincture of art or academy
in grouping his figures and dis-
posing his attitudes; every thing
is left to a simple expression of af-
fecting nature: His Mater dolorosa
is the very extreme of sorrow; nor
is he anxious to maintain any trace
of beauty amidst his expressions of
affliction: I am of opinion that na
imagination, which had not been
aided by the spectacles of exhaust-
ed nature, which a nunnery ex-
hibits^ could have devised an ob-
ject so extremely woe-begone: It

'dily be believed in a country,
where paintings of this fort are
amongst the objects of devotion,
and where every private house is
furnished with its oratory and its
altar, that the pictures of Morales
must have been in general request;
it has been for the fame reason
extremely disficult for travellers to
extract out of Spain any piece of
rfiis author; and as he worked very
slowly and was not very industri-
ous or interested in his art, his
pictures are both very rare and ve-
ry permanent in their stations *4

Morales was summoned to the Es-

his whole substance could procure,

years and died in 1586. Some of
his paintings are preserved at Cor-
dova and Seville; and at Madrid
in the chapel of our Lady of the
Soledad, belonging to the convent
of the Trinitarians, I have been
shewn a Santa Veronica by his
hand: There is also an Ecce Homo
in the convent of the nuns of
Corpus Christi, which with other
specimens I have met in private
cabinets, confirm to me his title
to the appellation of El Divino.

employed at the Escorial in paint-
ing part of the principal cloyster,
the latter, who had formed him-
self in Italy, executed some sta-
tues in the great church of admi-
rable workmanship, and in the
grande gusto of Michael Angela.
Beltran also carved a crucisix for
the high altar at the Imperial col-
lege, lately occupied by the Je-
suits at Madrid, a work of infinite
merit and expression; there is
another on the high altar of the
college at Alcala de Henares,
which I have not seen, but which
is no less celebrated: Both these
ingenious - artists died in the year
1590, both were men of amiable

manners, great candour and- re-
markable modesty.
The fame year was also fatal to
Teodo/io Mingof the Catalan, (a dis-
ciple of Michael Angela) and Luis
de Carvajal of Toledo, both emi-:
nent painters, and both employed
at the Escorial: Part of the prin-
cipal cloyfter is painted by Carva-
jal, and amongst the paintings in
the church specimens of a respect-
able sort are to be found of both
these masters.
But amongst the principal ar-
tists, employed by Philip in the
paintings of the Escorial, the
Elder Ccello was one in the chief
favour and esteem of that sove-
reign, who in his letters stiles him
'Thiano Portugues (for he was of
that

that nation) and addresses him by
the affectionate appellation of my
beloved son Alonjo Sanchez Cpello.
He studied at Rome in the school
of Rafael de Urhino, and compleat-
ed himself in his art under the in-
struction of Antonio Moro in Spain;
he passed from Spain into Portu^
gal, and was in the service of Don
Juan, and afterwards of his widow
Donna Juana, sister of Philip the
second: Upon the retirement of
Antonio Moro, the King of Spain
solicited his sister to supply the
loss of that great artist by send-
ing him Coello; upon his arrival
at the court Philip lodged him in
an apartment near at hand, with
which he had a private communi-
cation, for the purpose of yisiting

him, whilst: he was at work: On
these occasions he treated Coello
with great familiarity and conde-
scension; he was in such favour
with all the Royal family, that his
apartment became at times their
general- rendezvous; and in these
visits Coello made several portraits
of Philip on foot and horseback,
and of all the Royal or distin-
guished personages, that composed
the court: In short he became
considered as a man in such high
degree of favour, that his protec-
tion was lookt up to by the Cour-
tiers and Grandees and his house
and table frequented by the first
persons ih the nation, not-est expir-
ing Cardinal Grambelaj Don Gafr
par de Zueroga, archbishop of To*
ledo,

<page 100>
[ 87 ]
ledo, and Don Rodrigo de Castro, -
archbishop of Seville: Coelio was
no less in favour with Pope Gre-
gory the XHIth and Sixtus Quin-
tus, with the Dukes of Florence
and Savoy, Cardinal Farnese and
many other illustrious characters of
that time. After endowing a cha-
ritable foundation for the reception
of poor orphans at Valladolid, Co-
elio died in the sixty-fifth year of
his age in 1590; an æra fatal to
the arts in Spain.
If Coelio cannot properly be
considered as a native of Spain,
he must be acknowledged to rank
high amongst the chief artists,
who have flourished in that king-
dom: His paintings in the Esco-
rial, which are chiefly-of Saints af-

sixed to the respective altars, do
great honour to his memory; the
portrait, that he made of the great
patriarch San Ignacio, drawn from
an impression of his face, taken in
wax after his death, is much ce^-
lebrated; and his original sigures
of Sifiphus and Titius, as well as
his copies from I-itiano of Tanta-
lus and Ixion, now in the palace
of Madrid, are noble specimens.
His portraits of many royal and
noble persons, which are spoken
of as excellent, perished with
many other of his capital works
in the unfortunate sire of the Par-
do; of all which survive, the prin-
cipal in point of composition is
preserved in the church of San

his best and perhaps only resource
against: the vexations of state and
the intrusions of remorse: Haugh-
ty by nature and harsh through
disappointment, there were still
some moments, when his pride
sought the relief of familiarity,
and when his temper for a while
relaxed into complacency: In
those moments he would mount
the ladder, (the only one he ever
climbed without ambition or dis-
grace) that privately communi-
cated with the painting-room of
Coello, Philip had deserved well
of the arts, and in company with
them he found himself for once
amongst his friends: Coello had dis-
cretion, good manners and much
acquaintance with the world; if
. -, 1 the

<page 104>
[ 9i ]
the King encouraged conversa-
tion, Coello knew every body and
every thing, and out of those could
chuse his topics suitably and treat
them agreeably; if the King was
disposed to silence during his visit,
as was frequently the case, Coello
pursued his work with fixt atten-
tion, he pressed his canvass into
life with all the energy and spirit
of his genius: The king fate by,
contemplating the new creation,
which the hand of art was forming
in his sight, and for a while per-
haps forgot the breaches he had
caused in that of nature's -produ-
cing: By the easel of Coetto\ if he
was not defended from the cares,
he was at least: secure from the in-
trusions of Royalty. Whoever has
been

<page 105>
C 9* ]
been accustomed to look on du-
ring the operations of industry or
art, must have experienced a re-
pose of thought, an interval from
worldly inquietude, that steals in-
sensibly and gradually upon the
mind, as sleep does on the body:
If such are our sensations, whilst
contemplating the labourer at his
task, or the mechanic at his trade,
how much do we improve the avo-
cation, when the eye is called off
from every other object and fixed
upon one of the most pleasing and
surprizing in the whole circle of
human arts and inventions! We
may naturally believe that Philip
felt the benefits of this resource:
In his council-chamber the defec-
tion of provinces galled his pride,
2 and

<page 106>
t 93 }
and the dispersion of armadas
thwarted his ambition: In his
closet the injured Perez stung his
conscience and the unhappy Don
Carlos haunted his imagination;
but in the academy of Cocllo he saw
himself in his most favourable
light, and perhaps the only one,
which can reflect a lustre on his
memory.
The great works, which Philip
was carrying on at the Escorial,
and the magnificent collection of
paintings he was there amassing, at-
tracted the attention of all the ar-
tists in Europe, whilst the wealth
and munificence of the King held
out ample encouragement to ad-
venturers of merit. Spain at that
brilliant æra was in possession of

many native painters, who had
they been happy enough to have
found an historian to have done
justice to their fame, would at this
day. have ranked with the most dis-
tinguished masters of the age in
Italy; but their names are buried
in the obscurity of time, and their
works in that of cloysters and con-
vents.^.;
Philip pressed his favourite un-
dertaking with such ardour, and
the immeasurable walls of the con-
vent of San Lorenzo offered such
a field for emulation, that the har-^
vest could not be reaped by natives
only, however numerous; so that »
to conclude the work within the
period of his reign it was necessa-
ry to call in the assistance of more

labourers, and a great body of in-
genious emigrants accepted the
invitation: My design is to pre-
sent the reader with a fe\v local
anecdotes relative to the principal
characters of this description, the
gleanings of their better history,
which in general is so well known,
as to make any more diffusive re-
lation superfluous and imperti-
nent.
In selecting these I shall princi-
pally follow the order of time, in
which they flourished, for the pre-
sent however confining myself to
the reign of Philip the I Id-."
Antonio Mora (Sir Antony
More) the predecessor and pre-
ceptor of the elder Coelh above
mentioned, was -born at Utrecht,
- . where

<page 109>
[ 96 ]
where in the early years of his life
he studied in the school of Juan
Escorelio; from thence he passed
into Italy, where he ultimately
formed himself upon the models
of the great masters Michael An-
gelo and Rafael de Urbino. He
came into Spain 1552, Charles V.
being then on the throne, under
the protection of his countryman
Cardinal Grambeli; he made a
portrait of Prince Philip, and,
being recommended by the Cardi-
nal to the service of the Emperor,
he was sent by him into Portugal
to take, the portrait of the Prin-
cess Donna Maria,, then contract-
ed to Philip: At the fame time
he painted John III. of Portugal
and his queen Donna Catalina,
Charles's

<page 110>
[ 97 ]
Charles's youngest sister,; by all
which portraits he gave entire sa-
tisfaction, and was magnisicently
rewarded both by Charles and the
Royal personages above-mention-
ed. Having succeeded so well in
this commission, he was next dis-
patcht by the Emperor into Eng-
land to the court of Mary, to
take the portrait of that princess,
previous to herespousals with Phi-
lip: Moro: employed all the Mat-
tering aids of his art in this por-
trait, and .so captivated the cour-
tiers of Spain with the, charms
of Mary's person, .that he was em-
ployed by his patron the Cardinal
and many of the Grandees to make
copies of his picture, one of which
I have seen in possession of a noble
Vol. I. H family,

<page 111>
[ 98 ]
family, and by which it Ihould
appear that Moro was not only a
very good painter, but an excel-
lent courtier. Having enriched
himself by. his embassy to Eng-
land, he returned into Spain upon
the conclusion of peace between
that--kingdom and France, and
was eagerly received into the ser-
vice of: Philip II. then on the
throne. His excellence in the
painting of portraits supplied him
with ample employ in this court,
Philip, . who made slaves of his
friends and friends of his painters,
treats. Moro with extraordinary
familiarity. This great artist had
not all the courtly discretion of
his-scholar Coello, and met -the
King's advances with the fame ease

<page 112>
[ 99 ]
that they were made; so that one
day, whilst he was at his work
and Philip looking on, Moro
dipt his pencil in carmine, and
with it smeared the hand of the
King, who was resting his arm on
his shoulder: The jest was rash,
and the character, to which it was
applied, not to be played upon
with impunity; the hand of the
Sovereign of Spain (which even
the fair sex kneel down to salute)
was never so treated since the
foundation of the monarchy; the
King surveyed it seriously awhile,
and in that perilous moment of
Tuspence the fate of Moro balan-

ther say pity, turned the scale, and
Philip passed the silly action off
with a smile of complacency: The
painter, dropping on his knees,
eagerly seized those of the King,
and kissed his feet in humble a-
tonement for the offence, and all
was well, or seemed at. least so ta
be; but the person of the King

concluded that Antonio Moro, be-
ing a foreigner and a traveller,
had either learnt the art magic, or
obtained in England some spell or
charm, wherewith he had bewicht
the King: Nor let the heretical
reader treat this story as a fiction,
or think that the Fathers accord-
ing to the premises, on which their
judgments then were and still are
formed, reasoned much amiss;
for a disbelief in witches is a spe-
cies of criminal infidelity to the
present moment condemnable at
that sacred tribunal, of which I
could give a late very notable ex-
ample, if it was proper to make
public a gentleman's disgrace, for
which he has suffered punishment,

and of which it is hoped he has
duly repented. IF Antonio had
contended that he practised no
other charms upon Philip, than
those of his art, which over some
minds has a kind of bewitching
influence, such a plea would scarce
have parsed with his judges, whose
hearts were far out of reach of
such mechanical fascination; and
as little would it have served his
cause to plead the natural gaiety
and good-humour of the Monarch,
such an argument would have been
fairly set down amongst those quœ
-non admittuntur; so that his con-
demnation would have been ine-
vitable; for as it is hard to sup-
pose how any man could daub the

whilst the tortures were preparing
to force out the impious secrets of
his black and diabolic art: This

should rather say of the Devil,

that Philip moved him to revoke
fiis resolution, in vain that he so-
licited him by letters under his
Own hand, expressed in terms the
most kind and condescending,
and declarations even of affection
to his person, as well as of esteem
for his talents; the terrors of a
tribunal, from which even the
Royal hand, that he had so fami-
liarly treated, could not snatch
him, weighed down all the ca-
. resses, all the solicitations of the
King, and he departed, loaded
with the rewards of Philip's muni-
ficence, and penetrated with the1

12,000 ducats; a work of infinite

ing his own and that of his friend

worked by the square yard, Lucas

reasons than the respect he pre-
tended to entertain for the merit
and superior excellence of the ori-

Mateo Perez de Æefio, a Roman
by birth, was amongst the many
eminent foreigners, that migrated
into Spain during the reign of
Philip, though I do not find
that he Game thither by invita-
tion of the King, or that he exe-
cuted any thing at the Escorial:
His great work was a magnificent
fresco on the subject of St. Chris-
topher in the cathedral of Seville,
which those, who have visited that
church, speak of with rapture.
It will be susficient for me to ob-
serve of this artist (whose history

was held in universal estimation,
he departed for Italy, candidly de-
claring, that a country in posses-
sion of so great a living master as
Luis de Vargas> then residing at
Seville, of which place he was na-
tive, could not be benefited by
his talents, nor needed his assist-
ance; and so high was the opi-
nion he conceived of Vargas's su-
perior merits, that one day, whilst
he was contemplating a picture by
that artist of Adam and Eve, and
observing upon the masterly fore-
shortening of some of the parts,

to the leg of Adam, is more worth

alluding to the great fresco paint-
ing

ing above-mentioned-i On which
artist of the two this testimony
reflects most honour I leave with
the reader to determine^
Federico Zucaro is well known
to all, who are conversant in the
histories of the Italian masters; the
dissatisfaction that his perform-
ances in Spain gave to Philip is no
less notorious; insomuch that
his works were removed out of
the Escorial by order of that
King, and his fresco paintings in the
eloyster replaced by others of Pe-
regrino Tibaldi. Whether Philip's
expectations were raised too high
by the - report his emissaries in
Italy had made of Zucaro's ta-
lents, or whether the vanity of the
man disgusted him, which might
well

<page 124>
[ m ]
well be the case, so it was,-that o(
all the artists employed at. jheEsr
corial, he alone fell short irr exe-
cution and failed of success*.. At
ihe fame time, that Philip. dis-
missed him from his service,, he
compensated him in so princely a
manner for his undertaking, that I
.am inclined to think upon the evi-
dence of some letters, which pass-
ed between the King and his am-
bassador at Rome Don Juan de
Zuniga and the Conde de. Olivares,
that the payments ijxzde$o.Zucaro
were larger,. than to any other
painter, which came into Spain.;
but however he might, profit in

lays Zuearo,. as he was displaying
a painting of the Nativity for the
great altar at the Escorial, you now
behold all that art can execute; be"
yond this, which I have done, the.
sowers of painting cannot go: The
King was silent for a time, and so.
unmoved, that neither approba-
tion, nor contempt could be deter-
mined from the expression of his
countenance; at last, preserving;
still the same indifference, he ask-
ed if those were eggs, which one
of the shepherds, in the act of
running, carried in his basket;
the painter answered him they
were: 'IYj well he did not break them,,
said the King, and turned away;.
the picture was dismissed. Upon
another occasion, when Philip ex-
pressed

<page 126>

pressed his dissatisfaction with a
composition Zucaro had made up--
On the subject of the Visitation," he-
excused himself by saying it -waa
painted- by his scholars;-- Philip
desired him to" paint-the fame sub-
ject with his own hand; he did so,
and the second work fell short of
the first, and Philip remained still
more dissatisfied than before. At
length he gave him his dismission,
paying him, as I before observed,
with an extraordinary munificence.
Antonio El Obrerv, who had been-
instrumental in recommending
him to the King, kissed his Ma-
jesty's hand on the occasion, and re-

on the same subjects, which Philip
had rejected: The paintings ia
the Sagrario are by Peregrino on
the subject of Abraham and Mel-
chisedech; but what above all
things else establishes his reputa?-
tion in Spain is the cieling of the
Library: In this composition ths
painter has personified the Arts

In this year Casar Arbasia came

Carducbo continued in Spain seve-

the succeeding King Philip the

lace of the Pardo; the subject was
to be taken from the life and ac-

These examples -will serve to lhew
that the fair sex had their share of
fame at this illustrious æra of the

scribed to the -national- stock of
genius many eminent names; in
particular Father Nicolas Fatter, a
Franciscan monk, born in the city
of Valencia; Pablo ie Ceffedes of
Cordova,a dignitary in that church,
Father Francisco Galeas, of the or-
der of Carthusians, a native of
Seville, and Father Juan de la Mi-

of the oriental and classic lan-
guages, and spoke several of the
living ones: He composed many
works, which his modesty with-
held from the world, and some,
that he published: Amongst the
latter is a treatise on the antiquitie*
of his church, proving it to have
been a temple of Janus, and ex-
plaining many emblems and in-
scriptions in proof of his position.
In the art of painting, whether in
respect of theory or practice, Ces-
j>edes holds his rank with the very
first names Spain has to boast of;
in pursuit of this study he went
twice to Rome, and formed his

stile upon the model of the great
Michael Angelo, not in paining
only, but in architecture and sculp-
ture also; in, both which, by the
happy fertility of his genius^ he
acquired great fame. It was hjs
practice to model the heads of his
principal figures, when he was en-
gaged in any great historical com-
position, and several of these arq:
yet to be found in his native citji
of Cordova. When he was fy
Rome he supplied a head to a fa-
mous antique trunk of his country-
man Seneca in white marble, and
acquitted himself so happily jst.
this arduous undertaking, that he
was generally thought to have ex-
celled, the original, and, in testi-
mony of his triumph, the .Romans,

<page 144>
Caused to be. engraved upon it the
following words—Vittor il Spag-

which he compares the antient and
modern art and practice of paint-
ing: His contemporaries speak.o-f
this work-in high strains, . but it is
unfortunately lost to the world,
together with one in verse. on the
general subject of painting; for
the talents of this extraordinary-
man, amidst the circle of arts and
sciences, which they embraced,
are. reported to have excelled in
that of poetry. Cefpedes composed
several pictures during his resi-
dence at Rome, and in the church
of the Holy Trinity he was em-
ployed amongst the principal art-
ists of the time, and left there

some paintings in fresco of distin-
guished excellence: Amongstthese
artists Federico Zucaro was en gaged,
with whom Ces-ped.es formed an in*
timate and lasting friendship; as
I have been led to give some in-»
stances of Zucaro's vanity on i
former occasion, I am more happy
in recording, to the credit of his
candour and modesty, that, when
he was applied to by the Bishop
arid Chapter of Cordova for a
painting of Santa Margarita,
be affixed to the high altar of the
cathedral, he peremptorily de>
dined the commission, giving for
answer, that while Pablo de Cef->
pedes was in Spain, there would be
no occasion to fend into Italy for
pictures: Though the worksK«f

Oe/fedeirare dispersed in Seville
and the oitiei of Andalusia* it, is
i* Cordova, that we must expect
to sind his principal performances,
particularly his famous composi-
tion of the Last Supper in the
high church: Palomino gives this
picture great commendation for
the nice discrimination of charac-
ters in Christ and his disciples, and
relates a circumstance of the dis-
gust, which Cespedes conceived
from the silly adoration of some of
his countrymen, who- were so en-
Ghanted with the execution of some
vases and jars of porcelain intro-
duced into the piece, that they to-
tally overlooked-the superior parts
of the composition, and, this be-
ing repeated upon several visits by

the mob "of spectators, which the
feme of so great a work drew to-
gether, it angered him to that de-;
gree, that he would have pro-
ceeded to strike out all these sub--
fervient ornaments from his piece,
if he had not been-diverted from
his purpose by the intreaties of his
friends and the submission of these
false and contemptible admirers.
As a colourist, Spain never pro-
duced a painter superior to Ces-
pedes: In anatomy, drawing and
perspective he was peculiarly cor-
rect: His angels in the Martyr-
dom of Santa Catalina, a picture
which he painted for the late Je-
suits'college atCordova,are touch-
ed with all the colouring and ef-
fect of Coregio, whom he much

There are several paintings by

de Vargas was not less remark-

--In endeavouring to apportion-
tfteir--due degrees of merit to the
several Spanish painters of this
æra, so fruitful in arts, I sensibly
feel the insufficiency of descrip-
tion, and have more than once
desisted from my work in despair
of giving any thing to the world
worth its notice and acceptance.
The description of a picture, like
that of a battle, -rarely brings its
object before the reader, though-

cuted: I know no method of

luftrated by any known compari-.
son; of this- fort was the great
artist whom I am next to men-
tion, Juan Bau". Juanes, a na-
tive of Valencia; a man, whose ce-
lebrity would rank with that o£
the first artists of the age of Leo X*
if his works laid in the track of
travellers, or by happy emanci-
pation could be set at liberty, and
made to circulate through the ca-
binets of Europe. Juanes, like
Morales, selected hia.;. subjects,

from the most sacred passages of
revelation; but his life, unlike
that of Morales, was in unison
with the purity and austerity-of his
taste; prepared by confession and
fasting, he sirst approached the al-
tar before he visited the easel;
painting with him was an act of
piety and devotion: The charac-
ters, which filled his canvass, were
of the holiest fort, and, as he gave
them life, he gave them adoration:
As the exercise of his art was itt
him an office of devotion, so his
moderation kept him from en-
gaging in any private commissions
with a view to gain; and I am
inclined to doubt if any picture of

the labour is the labour of lov£,
not the task of the hireling: It is
greatly to be lamented, that these
precious remains are shut in the
convents of Valencia, without any
hope of delivery and that free dis-
play, of which the mortmain of
superstition seems. for ever to de-
prive them. In the sacristy of the
church of San Pedro in Valencia
there will be sound a Christ by
Juanesy a San Sebastian and a San

cathedral of Valencia, on your
Jest hand hangs a picture of the

the "heads are excellent, the ex-

execution delicate in the highest

a copyist of Rafael appears from
the example of a Holy Family;

Nino Jesus is an exact transcript of

of Saints, by his genius a name

Juan Labrador a Spaniard, was
a scholar of the Divino Morales
and the best painter of fruits and
flowers and of still-life in general,

in this period. Bartolome Gonzalez,

Madrid in 1606, and was made
King's painter upon his arrival;
he made many portraits of the

which consumed that palace.
Domhiico Teotocopoli, commonly
called El Greco, flourished in this
æra; there are many remains of his
art, both as painter, statuary and
architect in the cities of New Cas-
tile. He came so near the manner
of his master Titrano, that many of
his pictures have passed upon the
world under that character; this it
seems was not fame susficient for
the vanity of Dminico; but in his

proof of his merit, in the several
elegant arts which he professed:
He was near eighty years old,
when he died at Toledo in 1635,.

Spain, who had the spirit to oppose
the exaction of a royal tax upon
the pictures painted and fold by
living masters, which he litigated
and obtained a favourable decree.

such applause from all the artists

with many handsome presents and
made a Knight of Christ in Por-

performed by Cardinal-Trexo Par-
riagua, a Spaniard: This was done
in presence of the Duke of Alcala,
his patron, in the house of the
Cardinal before-mentioned, who
gave him a gold chain and the

Francisco and Juan Ribalta were
father and son, born in Valencia,
and painters of such equal emi-
nence, that it is exceedingly dif-
ficult to distinguiso their respec-

posed his countryman Juanes for
his model, and sometimes paints
fo like his contemporary Vicencw
Carducho the Florentine, as scarce
to be distinguished from him of
this fort is his picture of the Last
Supper on she high altar of the
college of the Patriarch in Valen-

cisco Rib alt a t that, having painted
a crucifixion for the Pope's nuncio
in Spain, the picture was carried
to Rome, and, upon being shewn
to an eminent painter in that city,
he immediately exclaimed—O Di-
-Vitjo Rafaelo! judging it to be a

Adriano of Cordova was a lay
brother of the barefooted Carme-
lites; his works are few and con-
fined to the city abovemeationed;

died in the year 1630. This artist
was so diffident of himself, that he
used to deface or destroy his pic-
tures, as soon as he had executed
them; and so general was ; this
practice with him, that his friends
took occasion to intercede with
him for the preservation of his va-
luable productions in the name of
the souls in purgatory, knowing
his attachment to the holy offices
in their behalf: By this mode of
exorcism, the destroying spirit,

in the reigns of Philip the Hid and

employed in many eminent works
at the palace of the Pardo; tjhe
works of this master are to be
found in all the cities of Castile>

70 years: He instructed the fa-
mous Rizi, who was painter to
Philip the IVth and Charles the
lid, and formed many other dis-
ciples in his academy. - . .
. Philip the Hid died and was
succeeded in 1621 by his son Phi-
lip the IVth, a great patron of
the arts, in whose time flourished
men of very illustrious talent*.
In 1623 Charles Prince of Wales
came to Madrid, upon a youthful
sally of gallantry, to throw him-
self at the feet of the Infanta, lister
of Philip, and conclude, as he be-
lieved, a treaty of marriage, which
had been long in dependence and
obstructed by many disficulties and
delays :-

delays: In this expedition he was
accompanied by Pedro Pablo Ru-
bens of Antwerp: This great mas-
ter wa6 then in his forty-sixth year*
had concluded a long course of
study in Italy, being in high esti-
mation, upon his return to Flan-
ders., and greatly in favour with
the Archduke Albert and the In-
fanta Donna Isabel Clara Eugenia
his spouse; he had painted several
pictures by order of the Emperor
and of the King of England, and
had visit -d Paris, where, by order
of Mary of Medicis, he had exe-
cuted his famous paintings for the
Luxembourg palace with great
credit and success. Charles had
an early passion for the arts, and
was greatly attached to his fellow
traveller;

traveller; the honours, which the
King of Spain lavished upon his
Royal visitor with all the profuse
magnificence, that Spanish gal-
lantry could devise, extended
themselves to the person of his in-
genious companion. Olivares,
then the minister of Spain, had
splendor, and Philip was in pos-
session of taste: Rubens was in
turns caressed by both; the Royal
collections of the Escorial, Pardo
and Madrid opened to his view an
inexhaustible magazine of arts.
. Mr. Horace Walpole is mistaken
in thinking Rubens was in Spain,
during the administration of the
Duke of Lerma: This was not
so. Rubens had studied Titiano
and Pablo Verones at Venice with

distinguishing attention; the cabi-
nets of Philip now displayed such
superb compositions of these mas-
ters, particularly of "Titiano, as
equally captivated both the painter ,
and the Prince; Rubens, by order
of the Catholic King, copied the
Europa, the Baths of Diana, and
several other pictures of Titiano,
- which Charles had particularly ad-
mired; when these copies were
finished, it was expected, that
Philip should present them to the
Prince of Wales, and the compli-
ment would surely have been a
worthy one both to Charles and to
his favourite artist; but the ge-
nerosity of Philip meditated greater
lengths, and in truth it scarce
knew any bounds towards his

princely guest: He retained to
himself the copies and sent tp
Charles the originals. It is pro-
per in this place to observe, that
these valuable originals. returned
again to the possession of the King
of Spain, when Charles, by the
instigation of Buckingham^ made
occasion to dissolve his engage-
ments with the Infanta: to reject
the sister and yet to retain the pre-
sents of the Catholic monarch
would have been a conduct irre-.
concileable to the spirit and prin-
ciples of Charles; though his at-
tachment to the arts was as ardent
as any man's, he had the senti-
ments of a gentleman and pride
of honour superior even to his
love of the art of painting. In

the event of things it has come to
pass, that Charles, instead of tak-
ing from the Royal stock in Spain,
has been the means of some addi-
tions to k of the highest value.
Charles, having taken his depar-
ture for England, and the high
punctilio of the Spanish monarch
having supported itself to the latest
moment of his abode, by erecting
a pillar on the spot, where they
parted, Rubens at the same time
returned to Flanders; and Philip,
having now compleated his hunt-
ing-feat of the Torre de la Prada,
in the neighbourhood of Madrid,
applied to that artist for several
pictures in character with the pa-
lace, with exact descriptions of
the sizes of the canvasses and the

rooms and positions in which they
were to be hung; all these were
executed by Rubens, and tranf-
. mitted to the King, who highly
approved of them: many of thifi
dogs and Other animals in these
hunting-pieces were put in by his
scholars Azneira and Pedro de Vos,
who excelled in that branch of the
art. About this time the ConcU
Duque de Olivares, Philip's mini-
ster, had compleated his founda-
tion of a convent of barefooted
Carmelites, at the little town of
Loeches, in the neighbourhood of
Madrid, now belonging to his
Excellency the Duque de Alba.
Philip, to do a grace to his fa-
vourite and to make a merit with
the religious of that order, com>-

missioned Rubens for sorne pic-
tures, which he executed in his
grandest stile, and richest glow of
colours; Two of these, which
flank the altar, are of considerable
dimensions, and, in point of exe-
cution, not to be exceeded by any
-of the master; the first is an alle-
gorical composition on the Tri-
umph of Religion, which he has
personified and habited very grace-
fully: This figure is seated in a su-
perb triumphal carr, drawn by
four angels, with others in atten-
dance, bearing the cross and other
symbols, properly ia character;

rious characters of Infidelity, or

ham and Melchisedech, who of-
fers him bread and the tenth of

The three great kingdoms of
Europe (Spain, France and Eng-
land) were at this time governed
by the ministers Olivares, Richelieu
and Buckingham $ it was the reign
of favourites: Buckingham, who
had more caprice and less genius
than either of his contemporaries,
N 2, had

<page 193>
[ i8o. ]
had nevertheless contracted a great
esteem for Rubens, during their
expedition to Madrid; this was
not directed to his professional ta-
lents, but to those qualities and-
good conduct, which undoubtedly
he had, and which Buckingham
sagaciously enough determined to
call forth, when any great occasion
should present itself: Such was
now in view; Buckingham was at
Paris, negociating a marriage be-
tween Charles, who had lately suc-
ceeded to the throne, and the prin-
cess Mary, whom that prince had
seen at Paris in his way to Spain,
and of whose beauty and attractions
we have such striking testimo-
nials under the hand of Vandyke\
Though Buckingham at Madrid
.... had

<page 194>
t *«r ]
had wantonly avowed eternal err-
mity to the minister of Spain, he"
now entered upon a correspondence
with Rubens on the means of recon-
ciling the kingdoms, and this pro»
duced the second visit, which that
artist paid to Madrid in quality of
ambassador extraordinary from the
court of Brussels in the year 1628.
He staid nine months in Madrid
on this negociation, and, being at
times confined to his chamber by
the gout in his feet, he took the
opportunity of working at his easel;
in which time he compleated eight
grand pictures for the great saloon
of the palace, -of which his famous
Rape of the Sabines was one, and
also his Battle of the Romans and;
the Sabines. In this period, such:
, N 3 was

<page 195>
.
wu thar.rapidity of his pencil, that
he took fire several portraits of
King :Philip, offie of which i&
equestrian and grouped with se-
veral other figures; a magnificent
performance, and for which he re-
ceived a magnificent reward, with
the -honour of knighthood, of
naturalization and the golden key,
as gentleman of the chamber. He.
painted the Infanta a half-leHgth,
and the King of the fame size by
commission from the Arch-duchefs
Isabella; he made five or six other
portraits of illustrious persons.
: Superior to the little vain punc~
tilios of his.art,. he returned with
ardour to his task of Tcopying the
most capital works »f Titiano in.
the royal possession, such as the

picture, I could not help calling
to rhind the bitterness of Mengs'
criticism, when he is comparing
Rubens' copy of Titiano to a Dutch
translation of an elegant author ; and
in this train of thinking I could
not avoid drawing a comparison
in my mind between the piece
before me and that, which Mengs
himself has composed on the like
subject: The scene is the fame, the
actors the fame, and the catastro-
phe not to be diversisied: But with
Mengs all is lifeless, cold and flat;
methodized by art and measured
by rule; the groupeof an academy,
sitters for attitudes and hirelings
for sorrow; the dead body of the
-Christ is laid out and in like man-

year following he took his de-
parture, not without many dis-
tinguishing tokens of favour from
his Catholic Majesty, by whose
order the Conde Duque de Oli-

worth two thousand ducats; he
was also made secretary to the

there is an altar belonging to the

Young Ribera, though susfering
the extreme of poverty, felt within
himself such powers of genius* as
were superior to depression, and in
the school of Ribalta meditated an
excursion to Rome, there to receive
the last: finistiings of education in
his art: Thither he repaired, and,
enlisting himself in the academy^
pursued his studieswith an industry,
which knew no remission, but whilst
foe was in pursuit of the scanty
inecessaries for the demands of life-;
these he obtained by the sale of
some of his sketches and drawings

in the academy. Without friends
and at times almost without food
or raiment, he persisted in his
course with a stubborn virtuous
perseverance, which nothing could
divert from its object; if such a
mind and imagination are found to
delight in images of savage great-
ness and terrific sublimity, it is
little to be wondered at, and a
greater proof of his excellence
cannot be given, than the high
estimation,. in which his pieces of
the character above - mentioned
continue to be held, notwith-
standing the false effeminate deli-
cacy of modern: taste and fasiiioa
in pictures, now prevailing in Eng-
land, which discourages all ar~

horror, as a modern petite maitresse

young Ribera could not long re-
main undistinguished in the mass
of common students; Rome was
not a place, where merit could be
long hidden, nor was his merit of
a fort, that could be concealed any
where; his fellow - students and
teachers soon discovered the supe-
riority of his talents, and par ex-
cellence gave him the name of U
Spagnaleto; and a certain Cardinal,

served a tattered figure employed

ruin, which his genius wds now me-
naced with, alarmed his pride of
nature; with one gallant effort he;
burst the lhackles of temptation,--
and, sallying out of the palace of

virtuous Spaniard made a suitable
reply, and, cheering himself with
the resources of his art and the ap-
plauses of his conscience, persisted
in his poverty. The clear obscure
of Caravagio became his favourite
manner, and in the language, tho'
not with the motives, of Doctor
Young's Zanga he might have
said that horrors now were mt dis-
pleasing to him. The meagre en-
couragement he found in Rome
determined him to seek his better
fortune at Naples: For this place
he set out in a ragged.jacket, hav-

Spagnoleto surprized him; he clear-

were to the low occupation he had
engaged in; a further acquaintance,
opened to him the singular virtues
and good qualities he was possessed
or*, and he soon conceived the de-
sign of converting his servant into
*his son-in-law: He had an only
child, a daughter; the girl being
exceedingly handsome, and the fa-
very rich, an abundance of
suitors presented themselves to the
choice of her parents, but, the mo-
ment which Providence had de-

poor Ribera being now arrived, all

with the father, who had determined
upon his part and, calling Ribera
aside, proposed at once to bestow
his daughter with the better part
of his means immediately upon
"him; a proposition so totally above
expectation or hope staggered his
belief, and he entreated his mas-
ter not to make his misery and ill
fortune the object of his raillery
and ridicule; he was at a loss to
think what presumption could
have escaped him to merit this re-
buke; he was .not conscious of

gan theology or the poetical hell
had represented to appall the guilty
was to be found on the canvasses of
Ribera; a martyred San Bartolome,
stript to the muscles, became a
ftudy for anatomists: Cato of Utica
in the act of tearing out his bowels
brought the horror of self-murder
to the eyes and hearts of men:
Hercules struggling in the throes
of death and all the tortured in the
fabulous realm of Pluto were now
exhibited, like Eschylus's furies
on the stage of Athens, and in some
instances with the fame effects; for
it is -related, that a certain lady of
Amsterdam named Jacoba de Uffel

into Italy they were purchased on
the part of His Catholic Majesty
and transported into Spain, where
they are now preserved in the pa-
lace of the Buen Retiro. Many
other pictures of this master were
collected by the Viceroys of Naples
for the King and also for particu-
lar Grandees and brought into
Spain: In the royal collections of
Madrid and the Escorial there are
many; the great altar-piece of the
church Of Santa Isabel on the sub-
ject of the Conception is by Ribera,
and the head of the Virgin is the
portrait of his daughter. He died
at Naples in 1656, aged 67 years,

Luis Frisian,, a disciple of DomiT
ttico Grecoy was born in a small vil-
lage near the city of Toledo: He
certainly exceeded his master in
correctness of drawing and purity
of taste. It does not appear that
Dominico had any of the jealousies
.of his art about him in fhis treat-

under his tuition; on the contrary

most of these religious Societies are
rich, and those, whose funds did
not enable them to set the artists
at work, found benefactors amongst
the great, whose devotion or va-
inity disposed them to beautify and
enrich tke churches and altars.,
which they frequented, and where
such donations would be accepted
in the way of atonement, or re-
corded as acts of voluntary piety
and meritorious munificence: The

Lord's last supper to be painted for

their refectory, in the manner that
Titiano had adorned thit in the
monastery of San Lorenzo. Dominico
being obliged to decline the com-
mission on account of indisposition,
recommended his young pupil Luis
Tristan to the undertaking; the
monks accepted his services," and
upon delivery of the picture were
with reason satisfied with the per-
formance; nothing remained to be
adjusted but the price, and the de-
mand of the artist being for 200
ducats was deemed exorbitant; the
Fathers referred themselves to Do-
toiinico, who being then in a fit of
the gout was put into a coach and
conveyed to the convent; as soon
as he arrived there and had -deli-
berately surveyed the piece, "life

turned suddenly to his disbiple and
with a menacing tone and air, lift-
ing up his crutch, exclaimed against
'frist an for disgracing his art and all
who professed it, by demanding 200
ducats for the picture in question.
The triumph of the Fathers upon
this testimony of their umpire, so
decidedly as it seemed in their fa-
vour, was however soon reversed,
when Dominico directed his dis-
ciple to roll up the picture and
take it away with him to Toledo,
for that he should not leave it there
for five hundred ducats; then,
launching out into rapturous en-
comiums on the performance, he
began to put his decision into exe-
cution: Vexation and surprize now
took possession of the convicted

monks, their murmuring and com--
plaints were changed to inter-
cessions, and, after sufficient a-
tonement on their part, the mon
ney was paid and the picture-sur-
rendered to the refectory and obli-
vion: Certainly it is a capital com-
position, and whenever the Fathers
shall repent of the bargain made by;
their predecessors, there is not a
collector in Europe but will give
them their principal with ample
interelt upon their purchase. Tris-
