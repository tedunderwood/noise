or, VIRTUE Rewarded. . .

Dear S I R,
HAVE had inexpreſſible Pleaſure in the Per-
| uſal of your PAMELA. It intirely anſwers the
Charaćter you give of it in your Preface; nor
have you ſaid one Word too much in Commen-
dation of a Piece that has Advantages and Excel;
lencies peculiar to itſelf. For, beſides the beautifu
Simplicity of the Style, and a happy Propriety
and Clearneſs of Expreſſion (the Lettersbeing written
under the immediate Impreſſion of every Circum-
ſtance which occaſioned them, and that to thoſe
who had a Right to know the fair Writer's moſt
ſecret Thoughts) the ſeveral Paſſions of the Mind
muſt, of courſe, be more affectingly deſcribed, and
Nature may be traced in her undiſguiſed Inclina-
tions with much more Propriety and Exačtneſs,
than can poſſibly be found in a Detail of Aëtions
long paſt, which are never recollečted with the
ſame Affections, Hopes, and Dreads, with which
they were felt when they occurred.
This little Book will infallibly be looked upon as
the hitherto much-wanted Standard or Pattern for
this Kind-of Writing. For it abounds with lively
Images and Pićtures; with Incidents natural, ſur-
priſing, and perfeótly adapted to the Story; with
“Circumſtances intereſting to Perſons in coºl.

Life, as well as to thoſe in exalted Stations. The
greateſt Regard is every where paid in it to Decency,
and to every Duty of Life: There is a conſtant Fit-
neſs of the Style to the Perſons and Charaćters de-
ſcribed; Pleaſure and Inſtrućtion here always go
hand in hand: Vice and Virtue are ſet in conſtant
Oppoſition, and Religion every-where inculcated in
its native Beauty and chearful Amiableneſs; not.
dreſſed up in ſtiff, melancholy, or gloomy Forms,
on one hand, nor yet, on the other, debaſed below .
its due Dignity and noble Requiſites, in Compliment
to a too faſhionable but depraved Taſte. And this
I will boldly ſay, that if its numerous Beauties are
added to its excellent Tendency, it will be found
worthy a Place, not only in all Families (eſpecially
ſuch as have in them young Perſons of either Sex).
but in the Colle&tions of the moſt curious and polite
• Readers. For, as it borrows none of its Excellencies
from the romantic Flights of unnatural Fancy, its
being founded in Truth and Nature, and built upon
: Experience, will be a laſting Recommendation to
the Diſcerning and Judicious; while the agreeable
Variety of Occurrences and Charaćters, in which it
abounds, will not fail to engage the Attention of the
gay and more ſprightly Readers. -
The moral Refle&tions and Uſes to be drawn from
the ſeveral Parts of this admirable Hiſtory, are ſo
happily deduced from a Croud of different Events
and Chara&ters, in the Concluſion of the Work, that I
‘ſhall ſay the leſs on that Head. But I think, the Hints
you have given me, ſhould alſo prefatorily be given
to the Publick; viz. That it will appear from ſeveral
Things mentioned in the Letters, that the Story muſt
have happened within theſe Thirty Years paſt: That
you have been obliged to vary ſome of the Names
of Perſons, Places, &c. and to diſguiſe a few of
the Circumſtances, in order to avoid giving Offence

to ſome Perſons, who would not chuſe to be point-
ed out too plainly in it; tho’ they would be glad it
may do the Good ſolaudably intended by the Publi-
'cation. And as you have in Confidence ſubmitted
to my Opinion ſome of thoſe Variations, I am much
pleaſed that you have ſo managed the Matter, as to
make no Alteration in the Faëts; and, at the ſame:
time, have avoided the digreſſive Prolixity too fre-

not only in thine own Country, but far from Home;

Writers of a neighbouring Nation; which now ſhall

Exchange for its own Droſs, which has ſo lon
‘paſſed current among us in Pieces abounding wit
all the Levities of its volatile Inhabitants. The
* reigning Depravity of the Times has yet left Virtue
‘many Votaries. Of their Protećtion you need not
deſpair. May every head-ſtrong Libertine whoſe
Hands you reach, be reclaimed; and every tempted
Virgin who reads you, imitate the Virtue, and meet
the Reward of the high-meriting, tho'low-deſcended,

To my worthy Friend, the Editor of

S I R, , - -
iſ RETURN the Manuſcript of Pamela by
ºthe Bearer, which I have read with a great deal
of Pleaſure. It is written with that Spirit of
Truth and agreeable Simplicity, which, tho' much
wanted, is ſeldom found in thoſe Pieces which
are calculated for the Entertainment and Inſtru-
Čtion of the Publick. It carries Convićtion in -
every Part of it; and the Incidents are ſo natural |
and intereſting, that I have gone hand-in-hand, and |
ſympathiz'd with the pretty Heroine in all her ||
Sufferings, and been extremely anxious for her
Safety, under the Apprehenſions of the bad Con-
ſequences which I expećted, every Page, would
enſue from the laudable Reſiſtance ſhe made. "I
have intereſted myſelf in all her Schemes efieſcape;
been alternately pleas'd and angry with her in her
Reſtraint; pleas'd with the little Kºinº and
“Contrivances ſhe ſet on foot for her Releaſe, and -
angry for ſuffering her Fears to defeat them; always
flamenting, with a moſt ſenſible Concern, the Miſ- -
carriages of her Hopes and Projećts. In ſhort, the
whole is ſo affecting, that there is no reading it
without uncommon Concern and Emotion.” Thus
far only as to the Entertainment it gives.
As to Inſtrućion and Morality, the Piece is full .
is of both. It ſhews Virtue in the ſtrongeſt Light,
*nd renders the Pračtice of it amiable and ºf:

The beautiful Sufferer keeps it ever in her View,
without the leaſt Oſtentation, or Pride; ſhe has it
ſo ſtrongly implanted in her, that thro’ the whole
Courſe of her Sufferings, ſhe does not ſo much as
heſitate once, whether ſhe ſhall ſacrifice it to Li-
berty and Ambition, or not; but, as if there were
no other way to free and ſave herſelf, carries on a
determin’d Purpoſe to perſevere in her Innocence,
and wade with it throughout all Difficulties and
Temptations, or periſh under them. It is an aſtoniſh-
ing Matter, and well worth our moſt ſerious Confi-
deration, that a young beautiful Girl, in the low
Scene of Life and Circumſtance in which, Fortune.
placed her, without the Advantage of a Friend capa-
ble to relieve and protećt her, or any other Educa-
tion than what occurr'd to her from her own
Obſervation and little Reading, in the Courſe of her
Attendance on her excellent Miſtreſs and Benefactreſs,
could, after having a Taſte of Eaſe and Plenty in a
higher Sphere of Life than what ſhe was born and
firſt brought up in, reſolve to return to her primi-
tive Poverty, rather than give up her finnocence. I
ſay, it is ſurpriſing, that a young Perſon, ſo circum-
ſtanced, could, in Contempt of proffer'd Grandeur
on the one ſide, and in Defiance of Penury on the
other, ſo happily and prudently condućt herſelf thro'
ſuch a Series of Perplexities and Troubles, and with-
ſtand the alluring Baits, and almoſt irreſiſtible Offers
of a fine Gentleman, ſo univerſally admired and
eſteemed, for the Agreeableneſs of his Perſon and
good Qualities, among all his Acquaintance; defeat
all his Meaſures with ſo much Addreſs, and oblige
him, at laſt, to give over his vain Purſuit, and ſacri-
fice his Pride and Ambition to Virtue, and become
the Protećtor of that Innocence which he ſo long
and ſo indefatigably labour'd to ſupplant: And all
this without ever having entertain'd the leaſt previ-
Otiº:

zii To the Editor of Pamela.
ous Deſign or Thought for that Purpoſe: No Art
uſed to inflame him, no Coquetry pračiſed to tempt
or intice him, and no Prudery or Affectation to
tamper with his Paſſions; but, on the contrary, art-
leſs and unpraćtiſed in the Wiles of the World, all
her Endeavours, and even all her Wiſhes, tended
only to render herſelf as un-amiable as ſhe could in
his Eyes: Tho' at the ſame time ſhe is ſo far from
having any Averſion to his Perſon, that ſhe ſeems
rather prepoſſeſs'd in his Favour, and admires his
Excellencies, whilſt ſhe condemns his Paſſion for
her. A glorious Inſtance of Self-denial. Thus her
very Repulſes became Attractions: The more ſhe
reſiſted; the more ſhe charm'd; and the very Means
ſhe uſed to guard her Virtue, the more endanger'd it, .
by inflaming his Paſſions: Till, at laſt, by Perſe-
verance, and a brave and reſolute Defence, the Be-
ſieged not only obtain’d a glorious Wićtory over the
Beſieger, but took him Priſoner too.
I am charmed with the beautiful Reflections ſhe
makes in the Courſe of her Diſtreſſes; her Solilo-
quies and little Reaſonings with herſelf, are exceeding
pretty and entertaining : She pours out all her Soul
in them before her Parents without Diſguiſe; ſo that
one may judge of, nay, almoſt ſee, the inmoſt Re-
ceſſes of her Mind. A §: clear Fountain of
Truth and Innocence; a Magazine of Virtue and
unblemiſh’d Thoughts!
I can't conceive why you ſhould heſitate a Mo-
ment as to the Publication of this very natural and
uncommon Piece. I could wiſh to ſee it out in
its own native Simplicity, which will affect and
pleaſe the Reader beyond all the Strokes of Ora-
tory in the World; for thoſe will but ſpoil it: and,
ſhould you permit ſuch a murdering Hand to be
laid upon it, to gloſs and tinge it over with ſuper-
fluous and needleſs Decorations, which, like .

much Drapery in Sculpture and Statuary, will but
encumber it ; it may diſguiſe the Faëts, mar the
Reflections, and unnaturalize the Incidents, ſo as to
be loſt in a Multiplicity of fine idle Words and
Phraſes, and reduce our Sterling Subſtance into an
empty Shadow, or rather frenchiff our Engliſh So-
lidity into Froth and Whip-ſyllabub. No; let us
have Pamela as Pamela wrote it; in her own Words,
without Amputation, or Addition. Produce her to
us in her neat Country Apparel, ſuch as ſhe appear'd
in, on her intended Departure to her Parents; for
ſuch beſt becomes her Pnnocence, and beautiful
Simplicity. Such a Dreſs will beſt edify and enter-
tain. The flowing Robes of Oratory may indeed,
amuſe and amaze, but will never ſtrike the Mind
with ſolid Attention. -
*In ſhort, Sir, a Piece of this Kind is much want-
ed in the World, which is but too much, as well
as too early, debauched by pernicious Novels. I
know nothing. Entertaining of that Kind that one
mightventure to recommend to the Peruſal (much
leſs the Imitation) of the Youth of either Sex: All
that I have hitherto read, tends only to corrupt their
Principles, miſlead their Judgments, and initiate them
into Gallantry, and looſe Pleaſures. -
Publiſh then, this good, this edifying and inſtru-
étive little Piece for their ſakes. The Honour of
Pamela's Sex dermands Pamela at your Hands, to
flew the World an Heroine, almoſt beyond Exam-
ple, in an unuſual Scene of Life, whom no Tempta-
tions, or Sufferings, could ſubdue. It is a fine, and
glorious Original, for the Fair to copy out and imi-,
tate. Our own Sex, too, require it of you, to free
us, in ſome meaſure, from the Imputation of being
incapable of the Impreſſions of Virtue and Honour;
and to ſhew the Ladies, that we are not inflexible
while they are ſo. : I
tº

<page 19>
xiv. To the Editor of PAMELA.
In ſhort, the Cauſe of Virtue calls for the Pub-
lication of ſuch a Piece as this. Oblige then, Sir,
the concurrent Voices of both Sexes, and give us
Pamela for the Benefit of Mankind: And as I be-
lieve its Excellencies cannot be long unknown to
the World, and that there will not be a Family with-
out it; ſo I make no Doubt but every Family that
has it, will be much improv’d and better'd by it.
*Twill form the tender Minds of Touth for the
Reception and Pračtice of Virtue and Honour; con-
firm and eſtabliſh thoſe of maturer rears on good and
ſteady Principles; reclaim the Vicious, and mend
the Age in general; inſomuch that as I doubt not
Pamela will become the bright Example and Imita-
tion of all the faſhionable young Ladies of Great
Britain; ſo the truly generous Benefactor and Re-
warder of her exemplary Virtue, will be no leſs ad-
mired and imitated among the Beau Monde of our.
own Sex. I am

5|HE kind Reception which this Piece
has met with from the Publick, (a
large Impreſſion having been carried
off in lºſs than Three Months) de-
arves not only Acknowledgment, but
ºzº] that ſome Notice ſhould be taken of
the Objections that have hithera, come to hand againſt
a few Paſſages in it, that ſº the Work may be rendered
as unexceptionable as poſſible, and, of conſequence, the
fitter to anſwer the general Deſign of it ; which is
to promote Wirtue, and cultivate the Minds of the
2%uth of both Sexes. . .
But Difficulties having ariſen from the different
Opinions of Gentlemen, ſºme f whom applauded the
very Things that others found Fault with, it was
thought prºper to ſubmit the Whole to the judgment
of a Gentleman of the moſt diffinguiſh’d faſte and
Abilities ; the Reſult of which will be ſeen in the

O U have agreeably deceiv'd me into a Sur-
+ prize, which it will be as hard to ex-
preſs, as the Beauties of PAME LA. Though I
open'd this powerful little Piece with more Expe-
ciation than from common Deſigns, of like Pro-
miſe, becauſe it came from your Hands, for my
£º. yet, who could have dreamt, he ſhould
nd, under the modeſt Diſguiſe of a Novel, all the
Soul of Religion, Good-breeding, Diſcretion, Good--
nature, Wit, Faney, Fine Thought, and Morality?
---Ihave done nothing but read it to others, and hear
others again read it, to me, ever ſince it came into
my Hands; and I find I am likely to do nothing
elſe, for I know not how long yet to come:
becauſe, if I lay the Book down, it comes after
me.—When it has dwelt all Day long upon the
Ear, It takes Poſſeſſion, all Night, of the Fancy.
—It has Witchcraft in every Page of it: but it
is the Witchcraft of Paſſion and Meaning. : Who
is there that will not deſpiſe the falſe, empty Pomp,
of the Poets, when he obſerves in this little, unpre-
tending, mild Triumph of Nature, the whole.

Powers of Emotion, and tranſplanting Ideas of

f Yer, I confeſs; there is One, in the World,
of whom I think with ſtill greater Reſpečt, than
of PAME LA : and That is, of the wonderful
AUTHOR of PAME LA.— Pray, Who is he,
Dear Sir and where, and how, has he been able
to hide, hitherto, ſuch an encircling and all-
maſtering Spirit? He poſſeſſes, every Quality that
ART could have charm'd by : yet, has lent it to,
and conceal’d it in, NATURE. --The Compre-
henſiveneſs of his Imagination muſt be truly prodi-
gious !--It has ſtretch'd out this diminutive mere
Grain of Muffard-ſeed, (a poor Girl's little, inno-
cent, Story) into a Reſemblance of That Heaven,
which the Beſt of Good Books has compar'd it to.
--All, the Paſſions are His, in their moſt cloſe
and abſtraćted Receſſes; and by ſelecting the moſt
delicate, and yet, at the ſame time, moſt powerful,
of their Springs, thereby to act, wind, and manage,
the Heart, He moves us, every where, with the
Force of a TRAGEdy. . . . . . . . . . . .
tº WHAT, is there, throughout the Whole, that I
do not ſincerely admire!—I admire, in it, the
ſtrong jº, and pićtureſque glow-
ing Likeneſs to Life, of the Chara&ters. I know,
hear, ſee, and live among 'em All: and, if I cou’d.
paint, cou’d return you their Faces, I admire, in
it, the noble Simplicity, Force, Aptneſs,” and
Truth, of ſo, many modeſt, oeconomical, moral,
prudential, religious, ſatirical, and cautionary,
Leſſºns ; which are introduc’d with ſuch ſeaſonable
12exterity, and with ſo poliſh'd and exquiſite a
Delicacy, of Expreſſion and Sentiment, that I am.
ºnly apprehenſive, for the Intereſts of Wirtue, left

i. Strokes of Good-breeding, Generoſity,
and Reflection, ſhou'd be loſt, under the too groſs
Diſcernment of an unfeeling Majority of Readers;
for whoſe Coarſeneſs, however, they were kindly
deſign'd, as the moſt uſeful and charitable Cor-
re&tives. ºf a - - -
“...ONE of the beſt-judg’d Peculiars, of the Plan,
is, that Theſe Inſtructions being convey’d, as in a
Kind of Dramatical Repreſentation, by thoſe beau-
tiful Scenes, Her own Letters and Journals, who
aćts the moſt moving and ſuffering Part, we feel
the Force in a threefold Effect, from the Motive,
the Aćt, and the Conſequence. -
But what, above All, I am charm'd with, is
the amiable Good-nature of the Author ; who, I
am convinc'd, has one of the beſt, and moſt gene-
rous Hearts, of Mankind : becauſe, miſ-meaſuring
other Minds, by His Own, he can draw. Every
thing, to Perfeótion, but Wickedneſs. I became
inextricably in Love with this delightful Defećt of
his Malice;—for, I found it owing to an Exceſs in
his Honeſty. Only obſerve, Sir, with what virtu-
ous Reluciance he complies with the Demands of
his Story, when he ſtands in need of ſome blame-
able Charaćters. Tho' his Judgment compels him
to mark 'em with diſagreeable Colourings, ſo that
they make an odious Appearance at firſt, He can’t
forbear, by an unexpected and gradual Decline from
Themſelves, to ſoften and tranſmute all the Hor-
ror conceiv'd for their Baſeneſs, till we are arriv'd,
through inſenſible Stages, at an Inclination to for-
give it intirely. - - º
I Must venture to add, without mincing the
matter, what I really believe, of this Book.---
It will live on, through Poſterity, with ſuch
unbounded . Extent of Good Conſequences, that

Tender: where It will afterwards guide and mode-
rate their Reflečtions and Reſolves, when grown
Older. And, ſo, a gradual moral Sunſhine, of
un-auſtere and compaſſionate Virtue, ſhall break out
upon the AEarld, from this TRIFLB (for ſuch,
I dare anſwer for the Author, His Modeſty miſ-
guides him to think it).-No. Applauſe therefore
can be too high, for ſuch Merit. And, let me
abominate the contemptible Reſerves of mean-ſpi-
rited. Men, who while they but heſitate their
• Eſteem, with Reſtraint, can be fluent and un-
check’d in; their Envy.— In an Age ſo deficient
in Goodneſs, Every ſuch Virtue, as That of this
. Author, is a ſalutary Angel, in Sodom. And One
who cou’d ſtoop to conceal, a Delight he receives
from the Worthy, wou’d be equally capable of ſub-

-- * in my laſt, expreſs'd, of the ſweet
*-Pamela, heing more than the bare Truth, which
every Man muſt feel, who lends his Ear to the
inchanting Prattler, why does, the Author's Mo-
deſty miſlead his Judgment, to ſuſpe&t the Style
wants Poliſhing? ---No, Sir, there is an Eaſe, a
natural Mir, a dignify’d Simplicity, and meaſured
Fullneſs, in it, that, reſemblingLife, outglows it!
He has reconciled the Pleaſing to the Proper.
The Thought is every-where exactly cloath’d
by the Expreſſion; And becomes its Dreſs as
roundly, and as cloſe, as Pamela her Country-
habit. Remember, tho’ ſhe put it on with hum-
ble Proſpect, of deſcending to the Level of her
Purpoſe, it adorn'd her, with ſuch unpreſum’d
Increaſe of Lovelineſs; ſat with ſuch meat Pro-
priety of Elegant Neglect about her, that it
threw out All her Charms, with tenfold, and
reſiſtleſs Influence.--- And ſo, dear Sir; it will be
always found.---When modeſt Beauty ſeeks to
hide itſelf by caſting off the Pride of Ornament,
it but diſplays itſelf without a *...& And

. . There were fºrmed by an anonymous Gentleman,
the following Objections, to ſºme Paſſages in the
Work. - -
- sº * * a Q , , oº,
1. That the Style ought to be a little raiſed, at
leaſt ſo ſoon as Pamela knows the Gentleman’s
Love is honourable, and when his Diffidence is
changed to Eaſe : And from about the fourth Day
after-Marriage, it ſhould be equal to the Rank ſhe
is rais'd to, and charged to fill becomingly.” *
** 2. That to avoid the Idea apt to be jöin’d with
the Word’Squire; the Gentleman ſhould be ſtyled
Sir James; ºr Sir john, &c. and Lady Pavers
in a new Edition might procure for him the Title
of a Baronet.** ** Tº Tºº tº tº º
3. That if the ſacred Name were ſeldomer re-
ted, it would be better; for that the Wife
an’s Advice is, Be not righteok over-much.
4. That the Penance which Pamela ſuffers from
‘Lady Davers might be ſhorten’d: “That ſhe is too
timorous after owning her Marriage to that Lady,
andought to have a littlemore Spirit, and get away
ſooner out at the Window; or call her own Ser-
vants to protećt, and carry her to her Huſband's
Appointment. ºv. -- " - ... s. * * : -- - -
_º 5. That Females are too apt to be ſtruck with
Images of Beauty; and that the Paſſage where the
Gentleman is ſaid to ſpan the Waiſt of Pamela
with his Hand, is enough to ruin a Nation of Wo-
men by Tight-lacing. - ), * . . . . . . . . ;
6. That the Word naughty had better be changed
to ſome other, as Bad, '...} , Wicked, Wile, Aéo-
minable, Scandalous; Which in moſt Places would

give an Emphaſis, for which recourſe muſt other-
wiſe be had to the innocent Simplicity of the Wri-
ter; an Idea not neceſſary to the Moral of the Story,
nor of Advantage to the Charaćter of the Heroine.
7. That the Words, p. 305. Fºoliſh Thing that I
am, had better be Fooliſh that I am. The ſame Gen-
tleman obſerves by way of Poſtſcript, that Jokes are
eften more ſevere, and do nore Miſchief, than
more ſolid Objećtions; and would have one or
two Paſſages alter'd, to avoid giving Occaſion for
the Suppoſition of a double Entendre, particularly in
two Places which he mentions, viz. p. 175. and 181.
He is pleaſed to take notice ſ feveral other Things
of leſs Moment, ſome of which are merely typogra-
phical ; and very kindly expreſſes, on the le, a
high Opinion of the Performance, and thinks it may
do a great deal of Good : For all which, as well as
for his Objections, the Editor gives him very ſincere
Thanks. - -- - - -
Others are of Opinion, That the Scenes in many
Places, in the Beginning eſpecially, are too low ; and
that the º: of Lady Davers, in particular, are
carried too high, and above Nature. - * *
And others have intimated, That Pamela ought,
for Example ſake, to have diſcharg’d Mrs. Jewkes
jrom her Service. :* - . * - - - - - - -
Theſe are the moſt material Objećtions that have
come to hand, all which are conſidered in the follow-
ing Extracts from ſome of the moſt beautiful Letters
that have been written in any Language : ."

• The Gentleman's Advice, not to alter Pamela
• at all, was both friendly, and ſolidly juſt. I run
* in, with full Sail, to his Anchorage, that the

* I wonder indeed, what it is, that the Gentle-
men, who talk of Low, Scenes, wou'd deſire
ſhould be underſtood by the Epithet?---Nothing,
properly ſpeaking, is low, that ſuits well with the
Place it is rais’d to.----The Paſſions of Nature
are the ſame, in the Lord, and his Coach-man.
All, that makes them ſeem different conſiſts in
the Degrees, in the Means, and the Air, where-
to or wherewith they indulge 'em. If, in paint-
ing Diſtinaions like theſe, (whicharift but from
the Forms of Men's Manners, drawn from Birth,
Education, and Cuſtom) a Writer falls ſhort of
his Charaćters, there his Scene is a low one, in-
deed, whatever high Fortune it flatter’d. But,
to imagine that Ferſons of Rank are above a
Concern for what is thought, felt, or acted, by
others, of their Species, between whom and them-
ſelves is no Difference, except ſuch as was owing
to Accident, is to reduce Human Nature to a
Lowneſs, -too low for the Truth of her Frailty, ,
* In Pamela, in particular, we owe All to her
Lowneſs. It is to the docile Effects of this Low-
neſs of that amiable Girl, in her Birth, her Con-
dition, her Hopes, and her Vanities, in every
thing, in ſhort, but her ſirtue, ºr-that her Rea.
ders are indebted, for the moral. Reward, of
that Wirtue. ...And if we are to look for the Low

cauſe, as the Letters are writ to her Parents, it
wou'd have look'd like forgetting, and, in ſome
ſort, inſulting, the Lowlineſs of their inferior
Condition, to have aſſum'dº a new Air in her
fººt in Place of retaining a ſteady Humi-
lity. But, here, it muſt not be paſs'd unobſerv’d,
that in her Reports of Converſations that follow'd
her Marriage, ſhe does, aptly and beautifully,
heighten her Style, and her Phraſes; ſtill re-
turning however to her decent Simplicity, in her
Addreſſes to her Father and Mother. : " . . .

Likeneſs or Power, to the Paſſions. So complete

I think, carries Weight, is That, which adviſes
ſome little Contračion of the Prayers, and Ap-

and my poor Mother, who have enough to do to
maintain yourſelves; and, as my Lady’s Goodneſs
had put me to write and caſt Accompts, and made
me a little expert at my Needle, and other Qualifi-
cations above my Degree, it would have been no
eaſy Matter to find a Place that your poor Pamela
was fit for : But God, whoſe Graciouſneſs to us
we have ſo often experienc'd at a Pinch, put it into
my good Lady’s Heart, on her Death-bed, juſt an
Hour before ſhe expir'd, to recommend to my
young Maſter all her Servants, one by one; and
when it came to my Turn to be recommended,
(for I was ſobbing and crying at her Pillow) ſhe could
only ſay, My dear Son!--- and ſo broke off a little;
and then recovering — Remember my poor Pa-
mela 1 — And theſe were ſome of her laſt Words !
O how my Eyes run — Don't wonder to ſee the
Paper ſo blotted -
Well, but God's Will muſt be done — and ſo
comes the Comfort, that I ſhall not be oblig'd to re-

my Maſter ſaid, I will take care of you all, my

Mourning and a Year's Wages to all my Lady’s Ser-

having ſaid ſhe would do for me as I deſerv'd, order'd
the Houſe-keeper to give me Mourning with the

Guineas, and ſome Silver, which were in my old

ſome old Debt with Part; and keep the other Part to
comfort you both. If I get more, I am ſure it is
my Duty, and it ſhall be my Care, to love and cheriſh

when I could do nothing for myſelf: And ſo you

ſend it byjohn our Footman, who goesyour way; but
he does not know what he carries; becauſe I ſeal it
up in one of the little Pill boxes which my Lady had,
wrapt cloſe in Paper, that it mayn't chink; and be
ſure don't open it before him.
I know, dear Father and Mother, I muſt give you
both Grief and Pleaſure; and ſo I will only ſay, Pray

I have been ſcared out of my Senſes; for juſt
now, as I was folding this Letter, in my late
Lady's Dreſſing-room, in comes my young
Maſter! Good Sirs! how was I frightened I
went to hide the Letter in my Boſom, and he
ſeeing me tremble, ſaid, ſmiling, Who have
you been writing to, Pamela 3 — I ſaid, in my-
Confuſion, Pray your Honour forgive me ! —
Only to my Father and Mother. He ſaid,
Well then, Let me ſee how you are come on
in your Writing ! O how aſham'd I was —
He, in my Fright, took it, without ſaying more,
and read it quite thro’, and then gave it me
again; — and Iſaid, Pray your Honour forgive
me! — Yet I know not for what : For he was
always dutiful to his Parents; and why ſhould
he be angry, that I was ſo to mine / And in-
deed he was not angry; for he took me by the

In Anſwer to the preceding.
Dear PAMELA,
O U R Letter was indeed, a great Trouble, and
ſome Comfort to me and your P99 Mother.
We are troubled, to be ſure, for your good Lady's
Death,who took ſuch Care of you,and gave You Learn-
ing, and for Three or Four Years paſt has always been
giving you Cloaths and Linen, and every thing that a
3eniewoman need not be aſham'd to appear in.
But our chief Trouble is, and indeed a very great
One,

<page 48>
V 1 R T U E Rewarded. 5
one, for fear you ſhould be brought to any thing.
diſhoneſt or wicked, by being ſet ſo above yourſelf.
Every body talks how you have come on, and what
a genteel Girl you are, and ſome ſay, you are very
pretty; and indeed, Six Months ſince, when I ſaw
you laſt, I ſhould have thought ſo too, if you was not
our Child. But what avails all this, if you are to be
ruin’d and undone !— Indeed, my dear Child, we
begin to be in great Fear for you; for what ſignify
all the Riches in the World, with a bad Conſcience,
and to be diſhoneſt? We are, ’tis true, very poor,
and find it hard enough to live; tho' once, as you
know, it was better with us. But we would ſooner
live upon the Water and Clay of the Ditches I am,
forced to dig, than to live better at the Price of our
dear Child's Ruin.
I hope the good’Squire has no Deſign; but when
he has given you ſo much Money, and ſpeaks ſo
kindly to you, and praiſes your coming on; and Oh!
that fatal Word, that he would be kind to you, if
you would do as you ſhould do, almoſt kills us with
Fears.
I have ſpoken to good old Widow Mumford about
it, who, you know, has formerly lived in good Fa-
milies, and ſhe puts us in ſome Comfort; for ſhe ſays,
it is not unuſual, when a Lady dies, to give what ſhe
has about her Perſon to her Waiting-maid, and to
ſuch as fit up with her in her Illneſs. But then, why
ſhould he ſmile ſo kindly upon you ? Why ſhould
he take ſuch a poor Girl as you by the Hand, as
your Letter ſays he has done twice P Why ſhould
he ſtoop to read your Letter to us; and commend
your Writing and Spelling? And, why ſhould he give
you Leave to read his Mother's Books! — Indeed,
indeed, my deareſt Child, our Hearts ake for you;
and then you ſeem ſo full of joy at his Goodneſs,
ſo taken with his kind Expreſſions, which, truly, are
B 3 very

<page 49>
6 P A M E L 4: Or,
very great Favours, if he means well, that we fear—
Yes, my dear Child, we fear — you ſhould be too
grateful, - and reward him with that Jewel, your
Virtue which no Riches, nor Favour, nor any thing
in this Life, can make up to you.
I, too, have written a long Letter; but will ſay
one Thing more; and that is, That in the Midſt of
our Poverty and Misfortunes, we have truſted in
God's Goodneſs, and been honeſt, and doubt not to
be happy hereafter, if we continue to be good, tho’
our Lot is hard here; but the Loſs of our dear Child's
Virtue, would be a Grief that we could not bear,
and would bring our grey Hairs to the Grave at
Once. -
If, then, you love us, if you value God's Bleſfing,
and your own future Happineſs, we both charge you
to ſtand upon your Guard; and, if you find the leaſt
Attempt made upon your Virtue, be ſure you leave
everything behind you, and come away to us; for
we had rather ſee you all cover'd with Rags, and
even follow you to the Church-yard, than have it ſaid,
a Child of ours preferr'd any worldly Conveniencies
to her Virtue.
We accept kindly of your dutiful Preſent ; but
'till we are out of our Pain, cannot make uſe of it,
for fear we ſhould partake of the Price of our poor
Daughter's Shame: So have laid it up in a Rag
among the Thatch, over the Window, for a while,
leſt we ſhould be robb’d. With our Bleſfings and
our hearty Prayers for you, we remain,
Tour careful, but loving Father and Mother,
JoHN and ELIZABETH ANDREws.

Dear Father,
I Muſt needs ſay, your Letter has fill'd me with
much Trouble. For it has made my Heart,
which was overflowing with Gratitude for my Ma-
ſter's Goodneſs, ſuſpicious and fearful; and yet, I
hope I ſhall never find him to act unworthy of his
Charaćter; for what could he get by ruining ſuch a
poor young Creature as me? But that which gives
me moſt Trouble is, that you ſeem to miſtruſt the
Honeſty of your Child. No, my dear Father and
Mother, be aſſur’d, that, by God's Grace, I never
will do anything that ſhall bring your grey Hairs with
Sorrow to the Grave. I will die a thouſand Deaths,
rather than be diſhoneſt any way. Of that be aſſur’d,
and ſet your Hearts at Reſt; for altho’ I have liv'd
above myſelf for ſome Time paſt, yet I can be con-
tent with Rags and Poverty, and Bread and Water,
and will embrace them, rather than forfeit my good
Name, let who will be the Tempter. And of this
reſt ſatisfy'd, and think better of
Tour dutiful Daughter till Death.
My Maſter continues to be very affable to me. As
yet I ſee no Cauſe to fear any thing. Mrs. §er-
vis the Houſe-keeper too is very civil to me, and
I have the Love of everybody. Sure they can't
all have Deſigns againſt me becauſe they are

his Letter; and ſo I will now write to you; tho’
I have nothing to ſay but what will make melook more
like a vain Huſſy, than any thing elſe: Yet I hope I
ſhan’t be ſo proud as to forget myſelf. Yet there is a
ſecret Pleaſure one has to hear one's ſelf prais'd. You
muſt know then, that my Lady Davers, who, I need

given me good Advice to keep myſelf to myſelf; ſhe
told me I was a very pretty Wench; and that every
body gave me a very good Charaćter, and lov'd me;
and bid metake care to keep the Fellows at a Diſtance;
and ſaid, that I might do, and be more valu'd for it,
even by themſelves. *
But what pleas'd me much, was what I am going to
tell you; for at Table, as Mrs.jervis ſays, my Maſter
and her Ladyſhip talking of me, ſhe told him, ſhe
thought me the prettieſt Wench ſhe ever ſaw in her.

my Lord about it. She aſk'd, How old I was; and
Mrs. Žervis ſaid, I was Fifteen laſt February. Ol ſays

Now, my dear Father and Mother, tho’ this may
look too vain to be repeated by me, yet are you not

with me? – This ſhews that he has nothing bad in
his Heart. But john is juſt going away, and ſo I have
only to ſay, that I am, and will always be,
Tour honeſ as well as dutiful Daughter.
Pray make uſe of the Money. You may now do
it ſafely.
L E T T E R V.
My dear Father and Mother,
O HN being to go your way, I am willing to
write, becauſe he is ſo willing to carry any thing
for me. He ſays it does him good at his Heart to ſee
you both, and to hear you talk. He ſays you are both
ſo ſenſible, and ſo honeſt, that he always learns ſome-
thing from you to the Purpoſe. It is a thouſand Pities,
he ſays, that ſuchworthy Hearts ſhould not have better
Luck in the World! and wonders, that you, my Fa-
ther, who are ſo well able to teach, and write ſo good
a Hand, ſucceeded no better in the School you at-
tempted to ſet up; but was forced to go to ſuch hard
Labour. But this is more Pride to me, that I am come
of ſuch honeſt Parents, than if I had been born a Lady.
I hear nothing yet of going to Lady Davers. And
I am very eaſy at preſent here. For Mrs. Žervis uſes
me as if I were her own Daughter, and is a very good
Woman, and makes my Maſter's Intereſt her own.
She is always giving me good Counſel, and I love ber, .
next to you two, I think beſt of any body. She keeps
ſo good Rule and Order, ſhe is mightily reſpected by
us all; and takes Delight to hear me read to her; *
3
B 5 -

<page 53>
IO P A M E L A ; Or,
all ſhe loves to hear read, is good Books, which
we read whenever we are alone; ſo that I think I am
at home with you. She heard one of our Men, Harry,
who is no better than he ſhould be, ſpeak freely to me;
I think he called me his pretty Pamela, and took hold
of me, as if he would have kiſſed me; for which, you
may be ſure, I was very angry; and ſhe took him to
Taſk, and was as angry at him as could be, and told
me ſhe was very well pleaſed to ſee my Prudence and
Modeſty, and that I kept all the Fellows at a Diſtance.
And indeed I am ſure I am not proud, and carry it
civilly to everybody; but yet, methinks I cannot bear
to be look’d upon by theſe Men-ſervants; for they
ſeem as if they would look one thro’; and, as I gene-
really breakfaſt, dine, and ſup with Mrs. Jervis, ſo
good ſhe is to me, I am very eaſy that I have ſo little
to ſay to them. Not but they are very civil to mein
the main, for Mrs. Jervis's ſake, who they ſee loves
me; and they ſtand in Awe of her, knowing her to be a
Gentlewoman born, tho’ ſhe has had Misfortunes.
I am going on again with a long Letter; for I love
Writing, and ſhall tire you. But when I began, I
only intended to ſay, that I am quite fearleſs of any
Danger now: And indeed can but wonder at myſelf,
(tho' your Caution to me was your watchful Love)
that I ſhould be ſo fooliſh as to be ſo uneaſy as I have
been: For I am ſure my Maſter would not demean
himſelf ſo, as to think upon ſuch a poor, Girl as I,
for my Harm. For ſuch a thing would ruin his
Credit as well as mine, you know: Who, to be ſure,
may expect one of the beſt Ladies in the Land. So
no more at preſent; but that I am
rour ever-dutiful Daughter.

Dear Father and Mother, -
Y Maſter has been very kind ſince my laſt; for
he hasgiven me a Suitof mylate Lady's Cloaths,
and halfa Dozen of her Shifts, and Six fine Handker-
chiefs, and Three of her Cambrick Aprons, and Four
Holland ones. The Cloaths arefine Silk, and too rich
and too good for me, to be ſure. I wiſh it was no
Affront to him to make Money of them, and ſend it
to you : it would dome more good.
You will be full of Fears, I warrant now, of ſome
Deſign upon me, till I tell you, that he was with
Mrs. 7ervis when he gave them me; and he gave her
a Mort of good Things at the ſame Time, and bid
her wear them in Remembrance of her good Friend,
my Lady, his Mother. And when he gave me theſe
fine Things, he ſaid, Theſe, Pamela, are for you;
have them made fit for you, when your Mourning is
laid by, and wear them for your good Miſtreſs's ſake.
Mrs. Žervis gives you a very good Word ; and I
would have you continue to behave as prudently as
you have done hitherto, and every body will be your
Friend. -
I was ſo ſurpris’d at his Goodneſs, that I could not
tell what to ſay. I curteſy'd to him, and to Mrs.

might be deſerving of his Favour : And nothing

Dear Father,
IN CE my laſt, my Maſter gave me more fine
Things. He call'd me up to my late Lady's
Cloſet, and pulling out her Drawers, he gave me.
Two Suits of fine Flanders lac'd Headcloaths, Three.
Pair of fine Silk Shoes, two hardly the worſe, and .
juſt fit for me, and the other with rich Silver Buckles
in them (for my Lady had a very little Foot); and
ſeveral Ribbands and Topknots of all Colours ;..
Four Pair of fine white Cotton Stockens, and Three
Pair of fine Silk ones ; and two Pair of rich Stays.
I was quite aſtoniſhed, and unable to ſpeak for
a while; but yet I was inwardly aſhamed to take
the Stockens; for Mrs. Žervis was not there : If
ſhe had, it would have been nothing. I believe I
receiv'd them very awkwardly; for he ſmil'd at my
Awkwardneſs, and ſaid, Don't bluſh, Pamela : Doſt
think I don't know pretty Maids wear Shoes and
Stockens P
I was

I was ſo confounded at theſe Words, you might
have beat me down with a Feather. For, you muſt
think, there was no. Anſwer to be made to this: So,
like a Fool, I was ready to cry; and went away cur-
teſying and bluſhing, I am ſure, up to the Ears; for,
tho’ there was no Harm in what he ſaid, yet I did not
know how to take it. But I went and told all to Mrs.”
jervis, who ſaid, God put it into his Heart to be
good to me; and I muſt double my Diligence. It
looked to her, ſhe ſaid, as if he would fit me in Dreſs
for a Waiting-maid's Place on Lady Davers's own
Perſon. … i t - -
But ſtill your kind fatherly Cautions came into my
Head, and made all theſe Gifts nothing near to me
what they would have been. But yet, I hope, there
is no Reaſon; for what Good could it do to him to
harm ſuch a ſimple Maiden as me? Beſides, to be ſure,
no Lady would look upon him, if he ſhould ſo diſgrace,
himſelf. So I will make myſelf eaſy; and indeed, I
ſhould never have been otherwiſe, if you had not put
it into my Head; for my Good, I know very well.
But, may-be, without theſe Uneaſineſſes to mingle
with theſe Benefits, I might be too much puff’d up:
So I will conclude, All that happens is for our Good;
and ſo, God bleſs you, my dear Father and Mother;
and I know you conſtantly pray for a Bleſfing upon
me; who am, and ſhall always be, , , -
Tour dutiful Daughter.

Dear PAMELA,
I Cannot but renew my Cautions to you on your
Maſter's Kindneſs to you, and his free Expreſſion
to you about the Stockens. Yet there may not :

and I hope there is not, any thing in it. But when I
refle&t, that there poſſibly may, - and that if there ~
ſhould, no leſs depends upon it than my Child'sever-
laſting Happineſs in this World and the next; it is
enough to make one fearful for you. Arm yourſelf,
my dear Child, for the worſt; and reſolve to loſe
your Life ſooner than your Virtue. What tho’ the
Doubts I fill'd you with, leſſen the Pleaſure you
would have had in your Maſter's Kindneſs, yet what
fignify the Delights that ariſe from a few paltry fine
Cloaths, in Compariſon with a good Conſcience?
Theſe are indeed very great Favours that he heaps
upon you, but ſo much the more to be ſuſpected;
and when you ſay he look’d ſo amiably, and like an
Angel, how afraid I am, that they ſhould make too
great an Impreſſion upon you; For, tho' you are
bleſſed with Senſe and Prudence above your Years,
yet I tremble to think what a ſad Hazard a poor
Kiº. of little more than Fifteen Years of Age
ftands againſt the Temptations of this World, and a
defigning young Gentleman, if he ſhould prove ſo;
who has ſo much Power to oblige, and has a kind of
Authority to command as your Maſter. - *
I chargeyou, my dear Child, on both our Bleſſings,
poor as we are, to be on your Guard; there can be
no Harm in that: and fince Mrs. Jervis is ſo good a
Gentlewoman, and ſo kind to you, I am the eaſier
a great deal, and ſo is your Mother, and we hope
you will hide nothing from her, and take her Coun-
ſel in every thing. So, with our Bleſfings and aſſured
Prayers for you, more than for ourſelves, weremain
Tour loving Father and Mother.
Beſure don't let People's telling you you are pretty,
puff you up: for you did not make yourſelf, and

Virtue and Goodneſs only, that make the true

I Am ſorry to write you Word, that the Hopes I
had of going to wait on Lady Davers are quite
over. My Lady would have had me; but my Ma-
ſter, as I heard by-the-bye, would not conſent to it.
He ſaid, her Nephew might be taken with me, and
I might draw him in, or be drawn in by him; and
he thought, as his Mother loved me, and committed
me to his Čare, he ought to continue me with him;
and Mrs. Žervis would be a Mother to me. Mrs.
jervis tells me, the Lady ſhook her Head, and ſaid,
Ah! Brother 1 and that was all. And as you have
made me fearful by your Cautions, my Heart at
times miſgives me. But I ſay nothing yet of your
Caution, or my own Uneaſineſs, to Mrs jervis; not
that I miſtruſt her, but for fear ſhe ſhould think
me preſumptuous, and vain, and conceited, to have
any Fears about the matter, from the great Diſtance
between ſo great a Man, and ſo poor a Girl. But
et Mrs. Jervis ſeemed to build ſomething upon

his Grace; and ſo I will not, if I can help it, make

have not had a Letter from me in ſo many
Weeks; but a ſad, ſad Scene has been the Occaſion
of it. : For, to be ſure, now it is too plain, that
all your Cautions were well-grounded. O my dear
Mother! I am miſerable, truly miſerable!—But yet,
don’t be frighted, I am honeſt;-God, of his Good-
neſs, keep me ſo!
O this Angel of a Maſter! this fine Gentleman!
this gracious Benefactor to your poor Pamela I who
was to take care of me at the Prayer of his good
dying Mother; who was ſo careful of me, left I
ſhould be drawn in by Lord Davers's Nephew,
that he would not let me go to Lady Davers's:
This very Gentleman (yes, I muſt call him Gentle-
man, tho’ he has fallen from the Merit of that Title)
has degraded himſelf to offer Freedoms to his poor
Servant . He has now ſhewed himſelf in his true Co-
lours, and to me, nothing appears ſo black and ſo
frightful.
I have not been idle; but have writ from time to
time, how he, by ſly mean Degrees, expoſed his
wicked Views: But ſomebody ſtole my Letter, and I
know not what has become of it. It was a very long
one. I fear that he who was mean enough to do bad
things, in one reſpect, did not ſtick at this; but be it
as it will, all the Uſe he can make of it will be, that
he may be aſhamed of his Part; I not of mine. For
he will ſee I was reſolved to be virtuous, and glory'd
in the Honeſty of my poor Parents.

Mrs. §ervis was juſt gone from he; and I would
have gone out; but he ſaid, No, don't go, Pamela;

your Buſineſs requir'd it; and I hope I ſhall always
know my Place. -
Well, ſays he, my Buſineſs does require it ſome-
times, and I have a Mind you ſhould ſtay to hear
what I have to ſay to you.
... I ſtood all confounded, and began to tremble, and
ithe more when he took me by the Hand; for now no
Soul was near us.
My Siſter Davers, ſaid he (and ſeem’d, I thought,
to be as much at a Loſs for Words as I) would have
had you live with her; but ſhe would not do for you
what I am reſolved to do, if you continue faithful and
obliging. What ſay'ſt thou, my Girl? ſaid he, with
ſome Eagerneſs; hadſt thou not rather ſtay with me,"
than go to my Siſter Davers ? He look’d ſo, as fill’d
‘me with Affrightment; I don't know how; wildly, I
thought.
I ſaid, when I could ſpeak, Your Honour will for-
give me; but as you have no Lady for me to wait
upon, and my good Lady has been now dead this
Twelvemonth, I had rather, if it would not diſpleaſe
you, wait upon Lady Davers, becauſe—
I was proceeding, and he ſaid a little haſtily—Be-
cauſe you are a little Fool, and know not what's good
for yourſelf. I tell you, I will make a Gentlewoman
of you, if you be obliging, and don't ſtand in your
own Light, and ſo ſaying, he put his Arm about me,
and kiſs'd me !
Now you will ſay, all his Wickedneſs appear'd
plainly. I ſtruggled, and trembled, and was ſo be-
numb'd with Terror, that I ſunk down, not in a
Fit, and yet not myſelf; and I found myſelf in his
Arms, quite void of Strength; and he kiſſed me two
or three times, with frightful Eagerneſs.-At laſt I
burſt from him, and was getting out of the Summer-

Fear, and all Reſpect, and ſaid, Yes, I do, Sir, too

when you forget what belongs to a Maſter. . . .
I ſobb’d and cry’d moſt ſadly. What a fooliſh

Fortune has made between us, by demeaning your-
ſelf, to be ſo free to a poor Servant. Yet, Sir, I will
be bold to ſay, I am honeſt, tho’ poor : And if you was
a Prince, I would not be otherwiſe.
He was angry, and ſaid, Who would have you
otherwiſe, you fooliſh Slut! Ceaſe your Blubbering.
I own I have demean'd myſelf; but it was only to
try you: If you can keep this Matter ſecret, you’ll
give me the better Opinion of your Prudence; and
here's ſomething, ſaid he, putting ſome Gold in my
Hand, to make you Amends for the Fright I put
you in. Go, take a Walk in the Garden, and don't
go in till your Blubbering is over: And I charge you
ſay nothing of what has paſt, and all ſhall be well,
and I’ll forgive you. -
I won’t take the Money, indeed, Sir, ſaid I; poor
as I am: I won't take it. For, to ſay Truth, I thought
it look'd like taking Earneſt; and ſo I put it upon the
Bench; and as he ſeemed vex'd and confus’d at what
he had done, I took the Opportunity to open the
Door, and went out of the Summer-houſe. …

and go to the next Town, and wait an Opportunity
to get to you; but then I was at a Loſs to reſolve
whether to take away the Things he had given me
or no, and how to take them away: Sometimes I
thought to leave them behind me, and only go
with the Cloaths on my Back; but then I had two
Miles and a half, and a By-way to the Town; and
being pretty well dreſs'd, I might come to ſome
Harm, almoſt as bad as what I would run away
from; and then may-be, thought I, it will be re-

deed!—O how I wiſh'd for my grey Ruſſet again,
and my poor honeſt Dreſs, with which you fitted
me out, (and hard enough too you had to do it!)
for going to this Place, when I was not twelve
Years old, in my good Lady's Days! Sometimes
I thought of telling Mrs. Žervis, and taking her
Advice, and only feared his Command to be ſe-
cret; for, thought I, he may be aſhamed of his
Aćtions, and never attempt the like again : And
as poor Mrs. §ervis depended upon him, thro’.
Misfortunes that had attended her, “I thought it
would be a ſad thing to bring his Diſpleaſure upon
her for my ſake. - - .
In this Quandary, now conſidering, now crying,
and not knowing what to do, I paſs'd the Time in
my Chamber till Evening; when defiring to be ex- .
cuſed going to Supper, Mrs. Jervis came up to me;
and ſaid, Why muſt I ſup without you, Pamela 3
Come, I ſee you are troubled at ſomething; tell me
what is the Matter. - -
I begg'd I might be permitted to lie with her
on Nights; for I was afraid of Spirits, and they
would not hurt ſuch a good Perſon as ſhe. That
was a ſilly Excuſe, ſhe ſaid; for why was you not
afraid of Spirits before ?—(Indeed I did not think
of that). But you ſhall be my Bed-fellow with all
my Heart, added ſhe, let your Reaſon be what it
will; only come down to Supper. I begg'd to be
excus’d; for, ſaid I, I have been crying ſo, that
it will be taken Notice of by my Fellow-ſervants;
and I will hide nothing from you, Mrs. Žervis, when
we are a-bed.
She was ſo good to indulge me, and went down
to Supper; but made more Haſte to come up to-
bed; and told the Servants, that I ſhould lie with
her, becauſe ſhe could not reſt well, and ſhe would

reading, as ſhe ſaid.
When we were alone, I told her all that had
paſſed; for I thought, though he had bid me not,
yet if he ſhould come to know I had told, it would
be no worſe; for to keep a Secret of ſuch a Na-
ture, would be, as I apprehended, to deprive my-
ſelf of the good Advice which I never wanted more;
and might encourage him to think I did not reſent
it as I ought, and would keep worſe Secrets, and
ſo make him do worſe by me. Was I right, my
dear Mother? . . .
Mrs. Jervis could not help mingling Tears with
my Tears; for I cry’d all the Time I told her the
Story, and begg'd her to adviſe me what to do; and
I ſhew’d her my dear Father's two Letters, and ſhe
praiſed the Honeſty and Inditing of them, and ſaid
pleaſing Things to me of you both. But ſhe begg'd
I would not think of leaving my Service; for, ſays
ſhe, in all Likelihood, you behav’d ſo virtuouſly,
that he will be aſham'd of what he has done, and
never offer the like to you again: Though, my dear
Pamela, ſaid ſhe, I fear more for your Prettineſs than
for any thing elſe; becauſe the beſt Man in the Land
might love you; ſo ſhe was pleaſed to ſay. She ſaid
ſhe wiſh’d it was in her Power to live independent;
that then ſhe would take a little private Houſe, and I
ſhould live with her like her Daughter. *
And ſo, as you order'd me to take her Advice, I
reſolved to tarry to ſee how Things went, without he
was to turn me away; altho’, in your firſt Letter, you
order'd me to come away the Moment I had any
Reaſon to be apprehenſive. So, dear Father and
Mother, it is not Diſobedience, I hope, that I ſtay;
for I could not expect a Bleſfing, or the good Fruits
of your Prayers for me, if I was diſobedient.

All the next Day I was very ſad, and began to
write my long Letter. He ſaw me writing, and
ſaid (as I mention'd) to Mrs. 7ervis, That Girl is
always ſcribbling; methinks ſhe might find ſome-
thing elſe to do; or to that purpoſe. And when I
had finiſh'd my Letter, I put it under the Toilet,
in my late Lady's Dreſſing-room, whither nobody
comes but myſelf and Mrs. Jervis, beſides my Ma-
ſter; but when I came up again to ſeal it up, to my
great Concern, it was gone; and Mrs. Žervis knew
nothing of it; and nobody knew of my Maſter's
having been near the Place in the Time; ſo I have
been ſadly troubled about it: But Mrs. 3ervis, as
well as I, thinks he has it, ſome how or other; and
he appears croſs and angry, and ſeems to ſhun me,
as much as he ſaid I did him. It had better be ſo
than worſe! - -
But he has order'd Mrs. §ervis to bid me not paſs
ſo much Time in writing; which is a poor Matter
for ſuch a Gentleman as he to take Notice of, as I
am not idle other-ways, if he did not reſent what he
thought I wrote upon. And this has no very good
Look. -
'But I am a good deal eaſier ſince I lie with Mrs.
jervis ; tho' after all, the Fears I live in on one
Side, and his Frowning and Diſpleaſure at what I
do on the other, make me more miſerable than

Sir, ſaid I, if you was not always welcome to yours
Honour's own Houſe. ` * : * * *****-* . . . . . .
I would have gone; but he ſaid, Don't run away;
I tell you. I have a Word or two to ſay to you.
Good Sirs, how my Heart went pit-a-pat! When I.
was a little kind to you, ſaid he, in the Summer-
houſe, and you carry'd yourſelf ſo fooliſhly upon it,
as if I had intended to do you great Harm, did I not
tell you, you ſhould take no Notice of what paſs'd,
to any Creature? And yet you have made a common
Talk of the Matter, not conſidering either my Re-
putation, or your own.—I made a common Talk of
it, Sir! ſaid I: I have nobody to talk to, hardly. ºf
He interrupted me, and ſaid, Hardly J you little
Equivocator! what do you mean by hardly Let me
ask you, Have you not told Mrs. Žervis for one?
Pray your Honour, ſaid I, all in Agitation, let me
go down; for ’tis not for me to hold an Argument
with your Honour. Equivocator, again! ſaid he,
and took my Hand, what do you talk of an Argu-
ment Is it holding an Argument with me, to anſwer
a plain Queſtion? Anſwer me what I ask'd. O good
Sir, ſaid I, let me beg you will not urge me further,
for fear I forget myſelf again, and be ſaucy. ºf .

what paſſed, if you intended no Harm? . . . . . .
“Well ſaid, pretty Innocent and Artleſ; 1 as Mrs.
jervis calls you, ſaid he ; and is it thus you taunt
and retort upon me, inſolent as you are! But ſtill I
will be anſwered direétly to my Queſtion? Why
then, Sir, ſaid I, I will not tell a Lie for the w.
I did tell Mrs. Žervis; for my Heart was almoſt
broken; but I open'd not my Mouth to any other.
Very well, Bold-face, ſaid he, and Equivocator again!
You did not open your Mouth to any other; but did
you not write to ſome other ? Why now, and pleaſe
your Honour, ſaid I, (for I was quite courageous juſt
then) you could not have aſked me this Queſtion if
you had not taken from me my Letter to my Father
and Mother, in which I own I had broken my Mind
freely to them, and aſked their Advice, and poured
forth my Griefs! - . . . . .

by ſuch a Saucebox as you? No, good, Sir, ſaid I,
and I hope your Honour won't be angry with me;
it is not I that expoſe you, if I ſay nothing but the
Truth. . So, taunting again! Aſſurance as you are!
faid he: I will not be thus talk’d to -
Pray, Sir, ſaid I, whom can a poor Girl take Ad-
vice of, if it muſt not be of her Father and Mo-
ther, and ſuch a good Woman as Mrs. Žervis, who,
for her Sex-ſake, ſhould give it me when aſked!
Inſolence! ſaid he, and ſtamp'd with his Foot, Am
I to be queſtion'd thus by ſuch an one as you? I
fell down on my Knees, and ſaid, For Heaven's
ſake, your Honour, pity a poor Creature, that knows
nothing of her Duty, but how to cheriſh her Vir-
tue and good Name: ; I have nothing elſe to truſt
to; and tho’ poor and friendleſs here, yet I have al-

ways been taught to value Honeſty above my Life.
Here's ado with your Honeſty, ſaid he, fooliſh Girl!
Is it not one Part of Honeſty, to be dutiful andgrate-
ful to your Maſter, do you think? Indeed, Sir, ſaid I,
it is impoſſible I ſhould be ingrateful to your Honour,
gr diſobedient, or deſerve the Names of Bold-face and
Inſolent, which you call me, but when your Com-
mands are contrary to that firſt Duty, which ſhall ever
be the Principle of my Life! . . . . . . . . .
He ſeem'd to be moved, and roſe up, and walk'd
into the great Chamber two or three Turns, leaving
me on my Knees; and I threw my, Apron over my
Face, and laid my Head on a Chair, and cry’d as if
my Heart would break, having no. Power to ſtir... 2
ief in his Heart! and riſing me up, he ſaid, Riſe,

have taken with my Name to my Houſe-keeper,
as alſo to your Father and Mother; and you may
as well have real Cauſe to take theſe Freedoms with
me, as to make my Name ſuffer for imaginary ones.
And ſaying ſo, he offer'd to take me on his Knee,
with ſome Force. O how I was terrify’d! I ſaid,
like as I had read in a Book a Night or two before,
Angels, and Saints, and all the Hoſt of Heaven, de-
fend me! And may I never ſurvive one Moment,
that fatal one in which I ſhall forfeit my Innocence.
Pretty Fool! ſaid he, how will you forfeit your In-
nocence, if you are oblig'd to yield to a Force you -
cannot withſtand? Be eaſy, ſaid he; for let the worſt
happen that can, ſº have the Merit, and I the
Blame; and it will be a good Subjećt for Letters to

dignation gave me double Strength, and I got looſe
from him by a ſudden Spring, and ran out of the

ſhift to get into it, and threw-to the Door, and the

Mrs.jervis gave me her Smelling-bottle, and had
cut my Laces, and ſat me in a great Chair, and he
call'd her to him: How is the Girl? ſaid he: I ne-
ºver ſaw ſuch a Fool in my Life. I did nothing at all
to her. Mrs. Jervis could not ſpeak for crying.
So he ſaid, She has told you, it ſeems, that I was
kind to her in the Summer-houſe, tho’ I’ll aſſure you,
I was quite innocent then as well as now; and I de-
fire you to keep this Matter to yourſelf, and let me
not be nam’d in it.
O, Sir, ſaid ſhe, for your Honour's ſake, and for
Chriſt's ſake—But he would not hear her, and ſaid—
For your own ſake, I tell you, Mrs. Žervis, ſay not
a Word more. I have done her no Harm. And I
won't have her ſtay in my Houſe; prating, perverſe
Fool, as ſhe is! But fince ſhe is ſo apt to fall into
Fits, or at leaſt pretend to do ſo, prepare her to ſee
me To-morrow after Dinner, in my Mother's Cloſet,
and do you be with her, and you ſhall hear what paſſes

riot and Four to be got ready, and went a Wifiting

that had happen'd, and ſaid I was reſolv’d not to ſtay

Mrs. §ervis is very loth I ſhould go; and #.

Well, you may believe how uneaſily I paſſed the
Time, till his appointed Hour came. Every Minute,
as it grew nearer, my Terrors increaſed; and ſome-
times I had great Courage, and ſometimes none at
all; and I thought I ſhould faint when it came to
the Time my Maſter had dined. I could neither eat
nor drink for my part; and do what I could, my
Eyes were ſwell'd with crying: - . . . . .

Don't your Heart ake for me? — I am ſure mine

So I cheard myſelf; but yet my poor Heart ſunk,
and my Spirits were quite broken. Every thing
that ſtirred, I thought was to call me to my Account.
I dreaded it, and yet I wiſhed it to come."
Well, at laſt he rung the Bell; O, thought I, that
it was my Paſfing-bell! Mrs, jervis went up, with
a full Heart enough, poor good Woman!. He ſaid,
here's Pamela ; Let her come up, and do you
come with her. She came to me: I was ready
to come with my Feet, but my Heart was with
my dear Father and Mother, wiſhing to ſhare your
Poverty and Happineſs. But I went.
... O how can wicked Men ſeem ſo ſteady and un-
touch'd, with ſuch black Hearts, while poor Inno-

I wiſh'd myſelf any-where but there, tho' I had be.

Mrs. #ervis, ſaid he, here you are both, together,
Do you fit down; but let her ſtand if ſhe will: Ay
thought I, if I can; for my Knees beat one againſt
another. Did you not think, when you ſaw the Girl
in the Way you found her in, that I had given her
É. reateſt Occaſion that could poſſibly be given
any Woman? And that I had ačtually ruined her, as
fhe calls it? Tell me, could, you think any thing
leſs?. Indeed, ſay’d ſhe, I fear'd ſo at firſt, Has ſhe

y She was a little too much fighted, as ſhe owned
afterwards, at his Sternneſ, and ſaid, Indeed ſhe

* Then ſplucked up my Spirit a little. Only! Mrs.
5ervis, ſaid I; and was not ... º. to ſhew

Honour's Degree demeans himſelf to be ſo free, as
that to ſuch a poor Servant as me, what is the
next to be expected?—But your Honour went fur-
ther, ſo you did; and threaten’d me what you would
do, and talk'd of Lucretia, and herhard Fate-Your
Honour knows you went too far for a Maſter to a
Servant, or even to his Equal; and I cannot bear it.
So I fell a crying moſt ſadly. . . . .
… Mrs. §ervis began to excuſe me, and to beg he
would pity a poor Maiden, that had ſuch a Value
for her Reputation. He ſaid, I ſpeak it to her Face,
+think her very pretty, and I thought her humble,
and one that would not grow i. my Favours, or
the Notice I took of her, but I abhor the Thought of
forcing her to anything. I know myſelf better, ſaid
he, and what belongs to me: And to be ſure I have
enough demean'd myſelf to take Notice of ſuch a
pne as ſhe; but I was bewitch'd by her, I think, to
be freer than became me; tho' I had no Intention

to carry the Jeſt farther. . .
What poor Stuff was all this, my dear Mother,
from a Man of his Senſe! But ſee how a bad Cauſe
and bad Aétions confound the greateſt Wits!—It
gave me a little more Courage then; for Innocence,
I find, in a weak mind, has many. Advantages over
Guilt, with all its Raºand Wiſdom. " " ' " S

So I ſaid, Your Honour may call this Jeſt-or |
Sport, or what you pleaſe; but indeed, Sir, it is not -
a jeſt that becomes the Diſtance between a Maſter
and a Servant. Do you hear, Mrs.jervisº ſaid he:
Do you hear the Pertneſs of the Creature? I had
a good deal of this Sort before in the Summer-houſe,
and Yeſterday too, which made me rougher with her |
than perhaps I had otherwiſe been. . . . . . ;
Says. Mrs. #ervis, Pamela, don’t be pert to his
Honour? You ſhould know your Diſtance; you ſee
his Honour was only in Jeſt. — Odear Mrs.jervis,
ſaid I, don't you blame me too. It is very difficult
to keep one's Diſtance to the greateſt of Men, when º
º
they won't keep it themſelves to their meaneſt Ser-
Wants. - **. : , ;
See again, ſaid he ; could you believe this of the
young Baggage, if you had not heard it? Good your
Honour, ſaid the well-meaning Gentlewoman, pity
and forgive the poor Girl; ſhe is but a Girl, and s
her Virtue is very dear to her; and I will pawn myº
Life for her, ſhe will never be pert to your Honour,
if you’ll be ſo good as to moleſt her no more, nor:
frighten her again. Said ſhe, You ſee how, by her
Fit, ſhe was in Terror; ſhe could not help it; and,
tho' your Honour intended her no. Harm, yet the
Apprehenſion was almoſt Death to her: And I had.'
much ado to bring her to herſelf again. O the little
Hypocrite! ſaid he; ſhe has all the Arts of her
Sex; they are born with her; and I told you a-while.
ago, you did not know her. But, ſaid he, this was .
not the Reaſon principally of my calling you before
me both together: I find I am likely to ſuffer in myº,
Reputation by the Perverſeneſs and Folly of this -
Girl. She has told you all, and perhaps more than
all; nay, I make no Doubt of it; and ſhe has writ-
ten Letters (for I find ſhe is a mighty Letter-writer!) |

this I won't bear; and ſo I am reſolv’d ſhe ſhall re-
turn to the Diſtreſſes and Poverty ſhe was taken
from; and let her take care how ſhe uſes my Name

• I was brighten’d up at once with theſe welcome,
Words: And I threw myſelf upon my Knees at his

She aſk'd, If ſhe ſhould call me again? He ſaid, Yes;
and then, No, let her go; it is beſt for her and me,
too, that ſhe ſhall go now I have given her Warn-

met with the Fellow of her in my Life, at any Age.
She ſaid, he had order'd her not to tell me all: But

as a Favour; tho' ſhe was not ſure neither.
I ſtay! dear Mrs. Žervis, ſaid I; why ’tis the beſt
News that could have come to me, that he will let
me go. I do nothing but long to go back again to

a Child half ſo dear to me as you. . . . . º. ºº

to do, dear Mrs. Yervis . I love you next to my own
Father and Mother, and to leave you is the chief Con-
cern I have at quitting this Place; but I am ſure it is
certain Ruin if I ſtay. After ſuch Offers, and ſuch
Threatenings, and his comparing himſelf to a wicked
Raviſher, in the very Time of his laſt Offer; and
making a Jeſt of me, that we ſhould make a pretty
Story in Romance; can Iſtay, and be ſafe? Has he
not demean’d himſelf twice? And it behoves me to
beware of the third time, for fear he ſhould lay his
Snares ſurer; for may-hap he did not expect a poor
Servant would reſiſt her Maſter, ſo much. And muſt
it not be look’d upon as a ſort of Warrant for ſuch
A&tions, iff ſtay after this? For I think, when one of
our Sex finds ſhe is attempted, it is an Encouragement
to a Perſon to proceed, if one puts one's ſelf in the
Way of it, when one can help it; and it ſhews one
can forgive what in ſhort, ought not to be forgiven:

Well, but, Mrs. 7ervis, ſaid I, let me ask you;
if he can ſtoop to like ſuch a poor Girl as I, as perhaps
he may (for I have read of Things almoſt as ſtrange,
from great Men to poor Damſels) What can it be
for?—He may condeſcend, may-hap, to think I may
be good enough for his Harlot; and thoſe Things
don’t diſgrace Men, that ruin poor Women, as the
World goes. And ſo, if I was wicked enough, he
would keep me till I was undone, and ’till his Mind
changed; for even wicked Men, I have read, ſoon
grow weary of Wickedneſs of one Sort, and love
Variety. Well then, poor Pamela muſt be turn'd off;
and look’d upon as a vile abandon'd Creature, and
every body would deſpiſe her; ay, and juſtly too,
Mrs. Žervis; for ſhe that can't keep her Virtue, ought
to live in Diſgrace. - . . . . .
But, Mrs.jervis, continued I, let me tell you, that
I hope, if I was ſure he would always be kind to me,
and never turn me offat all, that I ſhall have ſo much
Grace, as to hate and withſtand his Temptations,
were he not only my Maſter, but my King; and that
for the Sin's ſake. This my poor dear Parents have
always taught me; and I ſhould be a ſad wicked
Creature indeed, if, for the ſake of Riches or Favour,
T ſhould forfeit my good Name: yea, and worſé -

Well, good Mrs.jervis, ſaid I, let me askyou now;
—You and he have had ſome Talk, and you mayn't
be ſuffer'd to tell me all. But, do you think, if I was
to ask to ſtay, that he is ſorry for what he has done?.
ay, and aſham'd of it too? for I am ſure he ought,
conſidering his high Degree, and my low Degree,
and how I have nothing in the World to truſt to but
my Honeſty: Do you think in your own Conſcience
now (pray anſwer me truly) that he would never
º: anything to me again, and that I could be
fe?. - - . . .
Alas! my dear Child, ſaid ſhe, don't put thy home
Queſtions to me, with that pretty becoming Earneſt-
neſs in thy Look. I know this, that he is vex'd at
what he has done; he was vex'd the firſt time, more
vex'd the ſecond time. . . . . - *,
...Yes, ſaid I, and ſo he will be vex'd, I ſuppoſe, the
third, and the fourth time too, 'till he has quite
ruin’d your poor Maiden; and who will have Cauſe to
be vex'd then? . . . . . . . . . a
Nay, Pamela, ſaid ſhe, don't imagine that I would
be acceſſary to your Ruin for the World. I only can
ſay, that he has, yet, done you no Hurt; and’tis no
Wonder he ſhould love you, you are ſo pretty; tho’
iſo much beneath him: But I dare ſwear for him, he
never will offer you any Force. . . . s

if he ſhould have an Opportunity, a third time to

been aſham'd of his Wickedneſs at a Repuiſe, that
never would, had he ſucceeded. Beſides, Mrs. Žer-

what not? only for ſtanding on my neceſſary Defence:
And that where the Good of my Soul and Body, and
my Duty to God, and my Parents, are all concern'd.

Well, well, ſays ſhe; as he ſeems very deſirous
you ſhould not ſtay, I hope it is from a good Motive;
for fear he ſhould be tempted to diſgrace himſelf as
well as you. No, no, Mrs. Jervis, ſaid I; I have
thought of that too; for I would be glad to think of
him with that Duty that becomes me: But then he
would have let me gone to Lady Davers, and not
have hinder'd my Preferment. And he would not
have ſaid, I ſhould return to my Poverty and
Diſtreſs, when, by his Mother's Goodneſs, I had been
lifted out of it; but that he intended to fright me,
and puniſh me, as he thought, for not complying with
his Wickedneſs; and this ſhews me enough what
I have to expect from his future Gcodneſs, except I
will deſcrve it at his own dear, dear Price,

My dear Father and Mother,
I Did not ſend my laſt Letters ſo ſoon as I hop’d,
becauſe john (whether my Maſter miſtruſts or
no, I can't ſay) had been ſent to Lady Davers's, in-
ſtead of Iſaac, who uſed to go; and I could not be
ſo free with, nor ſo well truſt Iſaac ; tho’ he is very
civil to me too. So I was forced to ſtay ’till john
return'd. -
As I may not have Opportunity to ſend again ſoon,
and yet as I know you keep my Letters, and read
them over and over, (ſo john told me) when you
have done Work, (ſo much does your Kindneſs make
you love all that comes from your poor Daughter)
and as it may be ſome little Pleaſure to me, may-hap,
to read them myſelf, when I am come to you, to re-
mind me what I have gone thro’, and how great
God's Goodneſs has been to me (which, I hope, will
further ſtrengthen my good Reſolutions, that I may
not hereafter, from my bad Condućt, have Reaſon to
condemn myſelf from my own Hand as it were):
For all theſe Reaſons, I ſay, I will write as I have
Time, and as Matters happen, and ſend the Scribble
to you as I have Opportunity; and if I don’t every
time, in Form, ſubſcribe as I ought, I am ſure you
will always believe, that it is not for want of Duty. So

Iwill begin where I left off about the Talk between
Mrs.jervis and me, for me to ask to ſtay. ...
Unknown to Mrs. #ervis, I put a Projećt, as I
may call it, in Pračice. I thought, with myſelf
ſome Days ago, Here I ſhall go home to my poor
Father and §. and have nothing on my Back,
that will be fit for my Condition; for how ſhould
ur poor Daughter look with a Šik Night-gown,
§. Petticoats, Cambrick Head-doaths, fine Hol- .
land Linen, lac'd Shoes, that were my Lady's, and
fine Stockens! And how in a little while muſt the
have look'd, like old Caſt-offs indeed, and I look'd ſo
for wearing them! And People would have ſaid, (for
or Folks are envious, as well as rich). Seethers
oody Andrews's Daughter, turn’d home from her
fine Place? What a tawdry Figure ſhe makes! And
how well that Garb becomes her poor Parents Cir-
cumſtances!---And how would they look upon me,
thought I to myſelf,when they come to be thread-bare.
and worn out? And how ſhould I look, even if I
could get homeſpun Cloaths, to dwindle into them
one by one, as I could get them 2–May-be, an old
Silk Gown, and a Linſey-woolſey Petticoat, and
the like. So, thought I, I had better get myſelf atonce
'quipt in the Dreſs that will become my Condition;
and tho' it, may look but poor to what I have been
'us'd to wear of late Days, yet it will ſerve me, when
I am with you, for a good Holiday and Sunday Suit,
and what, by a Bleſſing on my Induſtry, I may, per-
hº make ſhift to keep up to. *** - \ . . .
o, as I was ſaying, unknown to any body, I
|bought of Farmer Nichols's Wife and Daughters, a
good ſad-colour'd Stuff, of their own Spinning,enough
to make me a Gown and two Petticoats; and I made

I. Pamela I ſaid he, How long are you to ſtay
here?--- Only, pleaſe your Honour, ſaid I, till I have
done the Waiſtcoat; and it is almoſt done. ---You
might, ſays he, (very roughly indeed) have finiſhed
that long enough ago, I ſhould have thought. In-
deed, and pleaſe your Honour, ſaid I, I have work'd
early and late upon it; there is a great deal of Work
in it. --Work in it ! ſaid he: yes, you mind your
Pen more than your Needle; I don't want ſuch idle
Sluts to ſtay in my Houſe. º
He ſeem’d ſtartled, when he ſaw the Butler. As he
enter'd the Hall, where Mr. jonathan ſtood, What
do you here? ſaid he---The Butler was as much con-
founded as I; for I, never having been tax’d ſo
roughly, could not help crying ſadly; and got out of
both their ways to Mrs. Žervis, and told my Com-
plaint. This Love, ſaid ſhe, is the D---!! in how many

Now you muſt know, that Mr. 3onathan, our
Butler, is a very grave good ſort of old Man, with
his Hair as white as Silver and an honeſt worthy
Man he is. I was hurrying out with a Flea in my Ear,
as the Saying is, and going down Stairs in:o the Par-

gentler manner tho’ than my Maſter) with both his;

Sheet or two of Paper. He ſaid, Ay, that I will, my

fers, a Stick of Wax, and twelve Sheets of Paper; and
coming from his Desk, where he was writing, he
ſaid, Let me have a Word or two with you, my ſweet

often call me; for I believe they love me dearly): I

- º My dear Father and Mother, -
W E had a great many neighbouring Gentlemen;
" and their Ladies, this Day at Dinner; and my
, Maſter made a fine Entertainment for them. And
Iſaac, and Mr. Jonathan, and Benjamin, waited at
Table. And Iſaac tells Mrs. Žervis, that the Ladies
will by-and-by come to ſee the Houſe, and have the
Curioſity to ſee me; for it ſeems, they ſaid to my
Maſter, when the Jokes flew about, Well, Mr. B---,
we underſtand, you have a Servant-maid, who is the
greateſt Beauty in the County; and we promiſe our-
ſelves to ſee her before we go.
The Wench is well enough, ſaid he ; but no ſuch
Beauty as you talk of, I'll aſſure ye. She was my
Mother's Waiting-maid, who, on her Death-bed, en-
gag'd me to be kind to her, . She is young, and every
thing is pretty that is young.
Ay, ay, ſaid one of the Ladies, that's true; but if
your Mother had not recommended her ſo ſtrongly,
there is ſo much Merit in Beauty, that I make no
doubt ſuch a fine Gentleman would have wanted no
ſuch ſtrong Inducement to be kind.
They all laugh’d at my Maſter: And he, it ſeems,
laugh’d for Company; but ſaid, I don't know how it
is, but I ſee with different Eyes from other People;
for I have heard much more Talk of her Prettineſs,
than, I think it deſerves: She is well enough, as I
ſaid; but I think her greateſt Excellence is, that ſhe
, is humble, and courteous, and faithful, and makes
all her Fellow-ſervants love her: My Houſekee Čr,
in particular, doats upon her; and you know, Ladies,
fhe is a Woman of Diſcernment: And, as for Mr.
Longman, and jonatham, here, if they *.

for her. Is it not true, jonathan 2 Troth, Sir, Åid
he, an’t pleaſe your Honour, I never knew her Peer,
and all your Hº: Family are of the ſame Mind.
Do you hear now? ſaid my Maſter---Well, ſaid the
Ladies, we will make a Viſit to Mrs. Žervis by-and-
by, and hope to ſee this Paragon.
I believe they are coming; and will tell you :
more by-and-by. I wiſh they had come, and were -
gone. 'Wºw, they make their Game without .

Well, theſe fine Ladies have been here, and gone
back again. I would have been abſent if I could, and
did ſtep into the Cloſet; ſo they ſaw me not when
they came in. *
There were four of them, Lady Arthur at the -
great white Houſe on the Hill, Lady Brookes, Lady
Towers, and the other, it ſeems, a Counteſs, of ſome
hard Name; I forget what. ,
So, Mrs. Žervis, ſays one of the Ladies, how do -
{...” We are all come to inquire after your
ealth. I am much oblig'd to your Ladyſhips, ſaid :
Mrs. Žervis : Will your Ladyſhips pleaſe to fit

come to ask after Mrs. ?ervis's Health neither; but
we are come to ſee a Rarity beſides. Ay, ſays Lady *
Arthur, I have not ſeen your Pamela theſe two .
Years, and they tell me ſhe is grown wond’rous pretty
in that Time.
Then I wiſh'd I had not been in the Cloſet; for
when I came out, they muſt needs know I heard
them: but I have often found, that baſhful Bodiesowe
themſelves a Spite, and frequently confound them-
ſelves more, by endeavouring to avoid Confuſion...:
Why, yes, ſays Mrs.jervis, Pamela is very pretty
indeed; ſhe's but in the Cloſet there:---Pamela, pray

and they ſmil'd at one another. "
The Counteſs took me by the Hand: Why, in-
deed, ſhe was pleaſed to ſay, Report has not been too

ſtar'd full in my Face); I wiſh I had juſt ſuch a Face

ady Arthur ſaid, Ay, my good Pamela, I ſay as
her Ladyſhip ſays: Don’t be ſo confus’d; tho’ tº:
it becomes you too. I think your good Lady de-
parted made a ſweet Choice of ſuch a pretty Atten-
dant. She would have been mighty proud of you, as
ſhe always was praiſing you, had ſhe liv'd till now.
Ahf Madam, ſaid Lady Brookes, do you think, that
ſo dutiful a Son as our Neighbour, who always admir’d
what his Mother lov’d, does not pride himſelf, for all
what he ſaid at Table, in ſuch a pretty Maiden?
She look'd with ſuch a malicious fineering Counte-
nance, I cannot abide her. -
Lady Towers ſaid, with a free Air, (for it ſeems ſhe
is call'd a Wit) Well, Mrs. Pamela, I can't ſay Ilike
you ſo well as theſe Ladies do; for I ſhould never
care, if you were my Servant, to have you and your
Maſter in the ſame Houſe together. Then they all
ſet up a great Laugh.
I know what I could have ſaid, if I durſt. But
*g are Ladies---and Ladies may ſay anything. . .
jays Lady Towers, Can the pretty Image ſpeak,
Mrs. Yervis #, I vow ſhe has ſpeaking Eyes! O you
little Rogue, ſaid ſhe, and tapt me on the Cheek, you
feem born to undo, or to be undone?
God forbid, and pleaſe your Ladyſhip, ſaid I, it
ſhould be either?—I beg, ſaid I, to withdraw; for the
Senſe I have of my Unworthineſs, renders me unfit
for ſuch a Preſence.

As ſoon as I have din'd, I will put on my new

Dear Father and Mother,
I Shall write on, as long as I ſtay, tho' I ſhould
have nothing but Sillineſſes to write; for I know
you divert yourſelves on Nights with what I write,

becauſe it is mine. john tells me how much you
long for my coming; but he ſays, he told you, he
hop’d ſomething would happen to hinder it.
I am glad you did not tell him the Occaſion of my
çoming away; for if they ſhould gueſs, it were better
ſo, than to have it from you or me: Beſides, I really
am concern'd, that my poor Maſter ſhould caſt ſuch
a Thought upon ſuch a Creature as me; for beſides
the Diſgrace, it has quite turn’d his Temper; and I
begin to think he likes me, and can't help it; and yet
ſtrives to conquer it, and ſo finds no way but to be
croſs to me.
Don't think me preſumptuous and conceited; for
it is more my Concern than my Pride, to ſee ſuch a
Gentleman ſo demean himſelf, and lefſen the Regard
he uſed to have in the Eyes of all his Servants, on my
Aºunt—but I am to tell you of my new Dreſs to-
ay.
And ſo, when I had din'd, up Stairs I went, and
lock'd myſelf into my little Room. There I trick'd
myſelf up as well as I could in my new Garb, and put
on my round-ear'd ordinary Cap; but with a green
Knot however, and my home-ſpun Gown and Petti-
coat, and plain-leather Shoes; but yet they are what
they call Spaniſh Leather, and my ordinary Hoſe, or-
dinary I mean to what I have been lately uſed to ; tho’
I ſhall think good Yarn may do very well for every
Day, when l come home. A plain Muſlin Tucker I
put on, and my black Silk Necklace, inſtead of the
French Necklace my Lady gave me; and put the Ear-
rings out of my Ears; and when I was quite 'quipp'd,
I took my Straw Hat in my Hand, with its two blue
Strings, and look’d about me in the Glaſs, as proud as
anything—To ſay Truth, I never lik'd myſelf ſo well
in my Life. -
O the Pleaſure of deſcending with Eaſe, Inno-
cence and Reſignation!---Indeed there is *:

like it! An humble Mind, I plainly ſee, cannot meet
with any very ſhocking Diſappointment, let Fortune's 1
Wheel turn round as it will. *:
So I went down to look for Mrs. §ervis, to ſee . .
how ſhe lik'd me. - .
I met, as I was upon the Stairs, our Rachel, who
is the Houſe-maid; and ſhe made me a low Curt’ſy,
and I found did not know me. So I ſmil’d, and :
went to the Houſe-keeper's Parlour: And there ſat :
good Mrs. Jervis at Work, making a Shift: And,
would you believe it? ſhe did not know me at firſt;
but roſe up, and pull'd off her Spečtacles; and ſaid;
Do you want me, forſooth 2 I could not help laugh-
ing, and ſaid, Hey-day!, Mrs.jervis, what! don't you
know me?---She ſtood all in Amaze, and .# atº.
me from Top to Toe; Why, you ſurpriſe me, ſaid:
ſhe; what tº Pamela thus metamorphos'd? How?
came this about 2 ---->
As it happen'd, in ſtept my Maſter; and my Back
being to him, he thought it was a Stranger ſpeaking
to Mrs. Gervis, and withdrew again; and did not
hear her ask, If his Honour had any Commands with
her?—She turn'd me about and about, and I ſhew’d
her all my Dreſs, to my Under-petticoat; and ſhe !
ſaid, fitting down, Why, I am all in Amaze: I muſt:
fit down. "What can all this mean? I told her, I had
no Cloaths ſuitable to my Condition when I return’d
to my Father's; and ſo it was better to begin here,
as I was ſoon to go away, that all my Fellow-ſervants
might ſee I knew how to ſuit myſelf to the State I,
was returning to. - -
Well, ſaid ſhe, I never knew the like of thee. But ſ
this ſad Preparation for going away (for now 1 ſee you
are quite in Earneſt) is what I know not how to get
over. O my dear Pamela, how can I part with you?

feems he ſaid to her, I was coming in to let you know
that I ſhall go to Lincolnſhire, and may-be to my
Siſter Davers's, and be abſent ſome Weeks. But,
pray, what pretty meat Damſel was with you? She ſays,
ſhe ſmiled, and ask'd, If his Honour did not know
who it was 2 No, ſaid he, I never ſaw her before.
Farmer Nichols, or Farmer Brady, have neither of
them ſuch a tight prim Laſs for a Daughter; have
they?—Tho' I did not ſee her Face neither, ſaid he.
If your Honour won’t be angry, ſaid ſhe, I will in-
troduce her into your Preſence; for, I think, ſays.
ſhe, ſhe out-does our Pamela. - - -
Now I did not thank her for this, as I told her after-
wards (for it brought a great deal of Trouble upon.
me, as well as Croſſneſs, as you ſhall hear). That can't
be, he was pleaſed to ſay. But if you can find an Ex-
cuſe for it, let her come in.
At that ſhe ſtept to me, and told me, I muſt go in
with her to my Maſter; but, ſaid ſhe, for Goodneſs:
fake, let him find you out; for he don't know you.
Q fie, Mrs. §ervis, ſaid I, how could you ſerve me
for Beſides, it looks too free both ix me, and to him.
I tell you, ſaid ſhe, you ſhall come in; and pray don't
reveal yourſelf till he finds you out.
So I went in, fooliſh as I was; tho' I muſt have
been ſeen by him another time, if I had not then.
#. ſhe would make me take my Straw-hat in my
and. -
I dropt a low Curt’ſy, but ſaid never a Word. I,
dare ſay, he knew me as ſoon as he ſaw my Face;
but was as cunning as Lucifer. He came up to me,
and took me by the Hand, and ſaid, Whoſe pretty
Maiden are you?--I dare ſay you are Pamela's Siſter,
ou are ſo like her. So neat, ſo clean, ſo pretty! Why, .

Siſter, you may believe; but I muſt kiſs you. .
O Sir, ſaid I, I am Pamela, indeed I am : Indeed
I am Pamela, her own ſelf! . . . -
He kiſſed me for all I could do; and ſaid, Impoſ.
fible! you are a lovelier Girl by half than Pamela;
and ſure I may be innocently free with you, tho’ f
would not do her ſo much Favour. -
* This was a ſad Bite upon me indeed, and what I
could not expect; and Mrs. 7ervis look'd like a Fool
as much as I, for her Officiouſneſs.--At laſt I got
away, and ran out of the Parlour, moſt ſadly vex'd, as
you may well think. -
He talk’d a good deal to Mrs. §ervis, and at laſt
order'd me to come in to him. Come in, ſaid he,
"you little Villain! for ſo he call'd me; good Sirs!
what a Name was there! Who is it you put your
Tricks upon? I was reſolved never to honour your
Unworthineſ, ſaid he, with ſo much Notice again;
and ſo you muſt diſguiſe yourſelf, to attract me, and
yet pretend, like an Hypocrite as you are—, , .
I was out of Patience, then; Hold, good Sir, ſaid
I don't impute Diſguiſe and Hypocriſy to me, above
all things; for H hate them both, mean as I am.
I have put on no Diſguiſe.---What a-plague, ſaid he,
for that was his Word, do you mean then by this
Dreſs?----Why, and pleaſe your Honour, ſaid I, I
mean one of the honeſteſt things in the World. I
have been in Diſguiſe indeed ever fince my good
Lady your Mother took me from my poor Parents.
I came to her Ladyſhip ſo poor and mean, that theſe
Cloaths I have on, are a princely Suit, to thoſe I
had then. And her Goodneſs heap'd upon me rich
Cloaths, and other Bounties: And as I am now re-
turning to my poor Parents again ſo ſoon, I cannot

He then took me in his Arms, and preſently puſh’d
me from him. Mrs. Žervis, ſaid he, take the little

afterwards, as fillily as ſuch a poor Girl as I. At

Strange things I have to tell you, that happen'd ſince
laſt Night, that good Mr. Jonatham's Letter, and my
Maſter's Harſhneſs, put me intoſuch a Fluſter, But I-
will no more preambulate. - -
I went to Mrs. Žervis's Chamber; and, O my
dear Father and Mother, my wicked Maſter had hidº
himſelf, baſe Gentleman as, he is! in her Cloſets,
where ſhe has a few Books, and Cheſt of Drawers.

thing; and ſo I did not do it then, being fully.
reſolved to be angry with Mrs. Jervis for what
had happened *". Day, and ſo thought of no-
thing elſe.
I ſat myſelf down on one Side of the Bed, and ſhe
on the other, and we began to undreſs ourſelves; but
ſhe on that Side next the wicked Cloſet, that held the
worſt Heart in the World. So, ſaid Mrs. Jervis, you
won't ſpeak to me, Pamela 1 I find you are angry with
me. Why, Mrs. Jervis, ſaid I, ſo I am, a little; 'tis
a Folly to deny it. You ſee what I have ſuffer'd by your
forcing me in to my Maſter: And a Gentlewoman of
your Years and Experience muſt needs know, that it
was not fit for me to pretend to be any body elſe for
Cmy own ſake, nor with regard to my Maſter.
But, ſaid ſhe, who would have thought it would
have turn'd out ſo? Ay, ſaid I, little thinking who
heard me, Lucifer always is ready to promote his
own Work and Workmen. You ſee, preſently, what
Uſe he made of it, pretending not to know me, on
purpoſe to be free with me : And when he took
upon himſelf to know me, to quarrel with me, and
uſe me hardly: And you too, ſaid I, to cry, Fie, fie,
Pamela!

Do you think, my Dear, ſaid ſhe, that I would
encourage him? ----Inever ſaid ſo to you before;
but ſince you force it from me, I muſt tell you,
that ever, ſince you conſulted me, I have uſed my
utmoſt Endeavours to divert him from his wicked
Purpoſes: And he has promiſed fair; but, to ſay all in
a'Word, he doats upon you; and I begin to ſee it is
not in his Power to help it.
* I luckily ſaid nothing of the Note from Mr. 3's-
mathan ; for I began to ſuſpect all the World almoſt:
But I ſaid, to try Mrs. 7ervis, Well then, what would
you have me do? You ſee he is for having me wait
on Lady Davers now.
Why, I'll tell you freely, mydear Pamela, ſaid ſhe,
and I truſt to your Diſcretion to conceal what I ſay:
My Maſter has been often deſiring me to put you upon
asking him to let you ſtay- +
Yes, ſaid I, Mrs. Jerviſ, let me interrupt you:
I will tell you why I could not think of that:... It
was not the Pride of my Heart; but the Pride of
my Homeſty; For, what muſt have been the Caſe?
Here my Maſter has been very rude to me, once,
and twice; and you ſay he cannot help it, though
he pretends to be ſorry for it: Well, he has given
me Warning to leave my Place, and uſes me very
harſhly; perhaps, to frighten me to his Purpoſes,
as he ſuppoſes I would be fond of ſtaying (as in-
deed I ſhould, if I could be ſafe; for I love you
and all the Houſe, and value him, if he would ačt
as my Maſter). Wei then, as I know his De-
ſigns, and that he owns he cannot help it; muſt I
not have ask'd to ſtay, knowing he would attempt
me again? for all you could aſſure me of, was, he
would do nothing by Force; ſo I, a poor weak Girl, was
to be left to my own Strength l And was not this

to allow him to tempt me, as one may ſay? and to
encourage him to go on in his wicked Devices? ---
How then, Mrs. §ervis, could I ask or wiſh to ſtay?
You ſay well, my dear Child, ſays ſhe; and you .
have a Juſtneſs of Thought above your Years; and -
for all theſe Conſiderations, and for what I have
heard this Day, after }. ran away, (and I am glad.
cannot perſuade you to ſtay; .
you went as you did)
and I ſhall be glad, which is what I never thought I
could have ſaid, that you were well at your Father's;
for if Lady Davers will entertain you, ſhe may as
well have you from thence as here. There's my
good Mrs. Žervis ſaid I; Godwill bleſs you for
your ; unſel to a poor Maiden, that is hard be-
ſet. But pray what did he ſay, when I was gone?
Why, ſays ſhe, he was very angry with you. But
he would hear itſ ſaid I: I think it was a little bold;
but then he provoked me to it. . And had not my Ho-
neſty been in the Caſe, I would not by any means
have been ſo ſaucy. Beſides, Mrs. Žervis, confider,
it was the Truth; if he does not love to hear of the
Summer-houſe and the Dreſſing-room, why ſhould he
not be aſhamed to continue in the ſame Mind? But,
ſaid ſhe, when you had muttered this º Oli
might have told him anything elſe. Well, ſaid { I
cannot tell a wilful Lye, and (othere's an End of it.
But I find you now give him up, and think there's Dan-

of the Houſe; ſo it was at the Bottom of a wet Ditch,
on the wildeſt Common in England.
Yº: ſaid ſhe, it ſignifies nothing to tell you all
he ſaid; but it was enough to make me fear you
would not be ſo ſafe as I could wiſh; and, upon my
Word, Pamela, I don't wonder he loves you; for,

Surprize ºpon us all! --- I believe truly, you owe
ſome of your Danger to the lovely Appearance you
made. Then, ſaid I, I wiſh the Cloaths in the Fire.
I expečted no Effect from them; but if any, a quite
contrary one.
* , Huſhº! ſaid I, Mrs. §ervis, did you not hear ſome-
thing ſtir in the Cloſet? No, ſilly Girl! ſaid ſhe; your
Fears are always awake. ---But indeed, ſaid I, ithink
I heard ſomething ruſtle. --- May-be, ſays ſhe, the
Cat may be got theré : But I hear nothing. -
I was huſh; but ſhe ſaid, Prythee, my good Girl,
make haſte to-bed. See if the Door be faſt. So I did,
and was thinking to look in the Cloſet; but hearing no
more Noiſe, thought it needleſs, and ſo went again
... and ſat myſelf down on the Bed-ſide, and went on un-
dreſſing myſelf. , And Mrs. #ervis, being by this
time undreſs'd, ſtept into Bed, and bid me haſten,
for ſhe was ſleepy. - *
I don't know what was the Matter; but my Heart
ſadly miſgave me; but Mr. jonathan's Note was
enough to make it do ſo, with what Mrs. 7ervis had
ſaid. I pulled off my Stays, and my Stockens, and
all my Cloaths to an Under-petticoat; and then hear-
ing a ruſtling again in the Cloſet, I ſaid, Heaven pro-
tect us! but before I ſay my Prayers, I muſt look into
this Cloſet. And ſo was going to it ſlip-ſhod, when
odreadfun our ruſh'd my Maſter, in a rich'fik and
£lver Morning Gown.
I ſcream’d, and ran to the Bed; and Mrs. fervis
ſcream'd too; and he ſaid, I’ll do you no Harm, if you
forbear this Noiſe; but otherwiſe take what follows.
Inſtantly he came to the Bed, (for I had crept into
it, to Mrs. fervis, with my Coat on, and my Shoes)
and, taking me in his Arms, ſaid, Mrs. Jervis, riſe,
and juſt ſtep up Stairs, to keep the Maids from

Joſe my Life in her Defence. Are there not, ſaid ſhe,
enough wicked ones in the World, for your baſe Pur-
Pºff but you muſt attempt ſuch a Lamb as this? .
He was deſperate angry, and threaten’d to throw her
out of the Window; and to turn her out of the Houſe
the next Morning. You need not, Sir, ſaid ſhe; for
I will not ſtay in it. God defend my poor Pamela till
To-morrow, and we will both go together.---Says he,
let me but expoſtulate a Word or two with you, Pa-
mela. Pray, Pamela, ſaid Mrs. Žervis, don't hear a
. Word, except heleaves the Bed, and goes to the other
End of the Room. Ay, out of the Room, ſaid I; ex-

let me know it, I was ready to die; and I fighed, and

‘Huſh, my Dear, ſaid Mrs.jervis; you have been in Fit

Mrs.jervis's ſecond Noiſe on my fainting away, ſlipt
out, and, as if he had come from his own Chamber,
diſturb’d by the Screaming, went up to the Maids
Toom, (who hearing the Noiſe, lay trembling, and
afraid to ſtir) and bid them go down and ſee what was
the Matter with Mrs. Žervis and me. And he chargd
Mrs. Žervis, and promiſed to forgive her for what ſhe
Had ſaid and done, if ſhe would conceal the Matter.
So the Maidscame down; for the Men lie in the Out-
houſes; and all went up again, when I came to myſelf
a little, except Rachel, who ſtaid to fit up with me,

gueſs the Matter to be badenough; tho’ they dare not

My dear Father and Mother,
I Did not riſe till Ten o’Clock, and I had all the
Concerns and Wiſhes of the Family, and Multi-
tudes of Inquiries about me. My wicked Maſter went
out early to hunt; but left Word, he would be in to
Breakfaſt. And ſo he was. --
He came up to our Chamber about Eleven, and
had nothing to do to be ſorry; for he was our Maſter,
and ſo put on ſharp Anger at firſt.
I .#great Emotions at his entering the Room, and
threw my Apron over my Head, and fell a crying, as
if my Heart would break.
Mrs. Žervis, ſaid he, ſince I know you, and you
ºme ſo well, I don't know how we ſhall live together for
1, the future, Sir, ſaid ſhe, I will take the Liberty to ſay
what I think is beſt for both. I have ſo much Grief,
that you ſhould attempt to do any Injury to this poor
Girl, and eſpecially in my Chamber, that I ſhould
think myſelf acceſſary to the Miſchief, if I was not to
take Notice of it. Tho' my Ruin therefore may de-
pend upon it, I deſire not to ſtay; but pray let poor
Pamela and mego together.With all my Heart, ſaid he,
; and the ſooner, the better. She fell a crying. I find,
ſays he, this Girl has made a Party of the whole Houſe
in her Favour againſt me. Her Innocence deſerves it of

could have ſo forfeited his Honour, as to endeavour to:
deſtroy a Virtue he ought to protećt. No more of
this, Mrs. Žervis, ſaid he; I will not bear it. As for
Pamela, ſhe has a lucky Knack at falling into Fits,
when ſhe pleaſes. But the curſed Yellings of you both
made me not myſelf. I intended no Harm to her, as I
told you both, if you'd have left yourSquallings; and
I did no Harm neither, but to myſelf; for I raiſed a
Hornet's Neſt about my Ears, that, as far as I know
may have ſtung to Death my Reputation. Sir, ſaid
Mrs. Žervis, then I beg Mr. Longman may take my
Accounts, and I will go away as ſoon as I can. As for
Pamela, ſhe is at her º, I hope, to go away

Well, Sir, ſaid ſhe, you have no Objećtion, I hope;,
to Pamela's going away on Thurſday next? You are
mighty ſolicitous, ſaid he, about Pamela : But, no,
not I; lether go as ſoon as ſhe will : She is a naughty

His Waiſtcoat ſtood an End with Gold Lace, and
he look'd very grand. But what he did laſt, has made
me very ſerious, and I could make him no Compli-

theſe: And it is no Matter what ſuch a one as I
wears. Said he, Why, you look very ſerious, Pa-
mela. I ſee you can bear Malice.---Yes, ſo I can

he, your Eyes always lock red, I think. Are you not
a Fool to take my laſt Freedom ſo much at Heart 2
I am ſure, you, and that Fool Mrs jervis, frightened
me, by your hideous Squalling, as much as I could
frighten you. That is all we had for it, ſaid I; and
if you could be ſo afraid of your own Servants know-
ing of your Attempts upon a poor unworthy Creature,
that is under your Protećtion while I ſtay, ſurely your
Honour ought to be more afraid of God Almighty,

Jargon. I did not ſend for you ſo much for your:
Opinion of my new Suit, as to tell you, you are wel-
come to ſtay, ſince Mrs.jervis deſires it, till ſhe goes.
I welcome! ſaid I; I am ſure I ſhall rejoice when I-
am out of the Houſe? : -
Well,” ſaid he, you are an ungrateful Baggage; ,
but I am thinking it would be Pity, with theſe fair
ſoft Hands, and that lovely Skin, (as he called it, and
took hold of my Hand) that you ſhould return again to
hard Work, as you muſt, if you go to your Father's; :
and ſo I would adviſe her to take a Houſe in London, ,
and let Lodgings to us Members of Parliament, when :
we come to Town; and ſuch a pretty Daughter as ,
you may paſs for, will always fill her Houſe, and ſhe'lli.
get a great deal of Money. -

Piece with theſe Words; nay,I will ſay’t, tho'you were it, ,
to be ever ſo angry.--I angry, Pamela! No, no, ſaid he, , º, .
I have overcome all that; and as you are to go away, I
look upon you now as Mrs.jervis's Gueſt, while you :
both ſtay, and not as my Servant; and ſo you may
ſay what you will. But I'll tell you, Pamela, why you

think you are grieving to leave the Houſe. Then,
Sir, ſaid I, I will try to convince them of the contrary,
as well as your Honour; for I will endeavour to be
more chearful while I ſtay, for that very Reaſon.

him ſee that; for they all miſtruſt already how
Matters are ; and as it is no Credit that I have been
attempted, tho’ it is that I have reſiſted; yet I am
ſorry they have Cauſe to think ſo evil of my Maſter

Mrs. Žervis has made up her Accounts with Mr.

Mr. Longman, it ſeems, took upon him to talk to
my Maſter, how faithful and careful of his Intereſts

told him, there was no Compariſon between her Ac-
counts and Mrs. Žewkes's, at the Lincolnſhire Biº.

He ſaid ſo many fine Things, it ſeems, of Mrs. §ervis,
that my Maſter ſent for her in Mr. Longman's Pre:
fence, and ſaid Pamela might come along with her:
I fuppoſe to mortify .# that I muſt go, while ſhe was
to ſtay: Butas, when I go away, I am not to go with
her, nor was ſhe to go with me; ſo I did not matter
it much; only it would have been creditable to ſuch a
poor Girl, that the Houſekeeper would bear meCom-
pany, if I went. ºf ºve
Said he to her, Well, Mrs. §ervis, Mr. Longman
ſays you have made up your Accounts with him, with
your uſual Fidelity and Exačtneſs. I had a good mind
to make you an Offer of continuing with me, if
you can be a little ſorry for your haſty Words, which
indeed were not ſo reſpectful as I have deſerv'd at
your Hands. She ſeemed at a ſad Loſs what to ſay
becauſe Mr. Longman was there; and ſhe could
not ſpeak of the Occaſion of thoſe Words, which
Was fºe.
* Indeed, ſaid Mr. Longman, I muſt needs ſay before
your Face, that fince I have known my Maſter's Fa-
mily, I have never found ſuch good Management in it,
nor ſo much Love and Harmony neither. I wiſh the
Lincolnſhire Eſtate was as well ſerv’d!-- No more of
that, ſaid my Maſter; but Mrs. Jervis may ſtay, if
fhe will; and here, Mrs. Jervis, pray accept of this,
which at the Cloſe of every Year's Accounts I will pre:
ſent you with, beſides your Salary, as long as I find
your Care ſo uſeful and agreeable. , And he gave her
five Guineas.---.She made him a low Curt’ſy, and
thanking him, look'd to me, as if ſhe would have
ſpoken to me.

Mr. Longman; but I can never be equally kind to

continued he, I ſaid that Girl might come in with Mrs.

Mrs.?ervis is very good to her, and loves her as well
as if ſhe was her Daughter. But elſe--- Mr. Longmas,
interrupting him, ſaid, Good to Mrs. Pamela 1 Ay,

He was going on. But my Maſter ſaid, No more,
no more, Mr. Longman. I ſee old Men are taken with
retty young Girls, as well as other. Folks; and fair
ooks hide many a Fault, where a Perſon has the Art
to behave obligingly. Why, and pleaſe your Honour,
ſaid Mr. Longman, every body--and was going on,
I believe to ſay ſomething more in my Praiſe; but
he interrupted him, and ſaid, Not a Word more of
this Pamela. I can't lether ſtay, I'll aſſure you; not
only for her own Freedom of Speech, but her Letter-
writing of all the Secrets of my Family. Ay I ſaid the
good old Man; I'm ſorry for that too! But, Sir–No
more, I ſay, ſaid my Maſter; for my Reputation's ſo
well known, (mighty fine, thought II) that I care not
what any body writes or ſays of me: But to tell you
the Truth, (not that it need go further, I think of
changing my Condition ſoon; and, you know, young
Ladies of Birth and Fortune will chuſe their own Ser-
vants, and that's my chief Reaſon why Pamela can't

IIMuſt write on, tho' I ſhall come ſo ſoon; for now
* I have hardly any thing elſe to do. Forf have
finiſh'd all that lay upon me to do, and only wait the
good Time of ſetting out. Mrs. ?ervis ſaid, I muſt
be low in Pocket, for what I had laid out; and ſo
would have preſented me with two Guineas of her
Five; but I could not take them of her, becauſe,
poor Gentlewoman, ſhe pays old Debts for her Chil-
dren that were extravagant, and wants them herſelf.
This, tho’, was very good in her.
I am ſorry, I ſhall have but little to bring with me;
but I know you won’t, you are ſo good l--- and I will

me learn both; and often and often has ſhe made
me ſing her an innocent Song, and a good Pſalm

lerably at my Fingers End, as they ſay; and ſheus'd
to praiſe me, and was a good Judge of ſuch Mat-
ters.
Well now, what is all this to the Purpoſe, as
Things have turn’d about?
Why, no more nor leſs, than that I am like the
Graſhopper in the Fable, which I have read of in my
Lady's Books: and I will write it down, in the very
Words:
“As the Ants were airing their Proviſions one
* Winter, a º Graſhopper (as ſuppoſe it was

“That he ſhould have wrought in Summer, if he
“ would not have wanted in Winter. Well, ſays

“ ſung out the whole Seaſon. Nay, then, ſaid they, .
.* you'll e'en do well to make a merry Year of it,
“ and dance in Winter to the Tune you ſung in

So I ſhall make a fine Figure with my Singing and
my Dancing, when I come home to you ! Nay, I
doubt, I ſhall even be unfit for a May-day Holiday-
time; for theſe Minuits, Rigadoons, and French
Dances, that I have been #. will make me but

it; for there ſhe puts her Sweet-meats and ſuch'Things;
and ſhe did it, it ſeems, to turn his Heart, as know-
ing what I intended, I ſuppoſe that he ſhould make me
take the Things; for if he had, I ſhould have made
Money of them, to help us when we got together;
ºfor, to be ſure, I could never have appear'd in them.

in this Cloſet; I ſuppoſe while I went to call Mrs.
fervis: And ſhe ſince told me, it was at his Deſire,

work. : -. . . . -* . So

96 PA M E L 4; Or,
So I ſaid, when ſhe came up, Here, Mrs.jervis,
is the firſt Parcel; I will ſpread it all abroad. Theſe
are the Things my good Lady gave me.--In the firſt
place, ſaid I---and ſo I went on deſcribing the Cloaths
and Linen my Lady had given me, mingling Bleſſings,
as I proceeded, for her Goodneſs to me; and when f
had turn'd over that Parcel, I ſaid, Well, ſo much
for the firſt Parcel, Mrs.jervis; that was my Lady's
Gifts.
Now I come to the Preſents of my dear virtuous
Maſter: Hay, you know, Cloſet for that! Mrs. Žer-
vis. She langh'd, and ſaid, I never ſaw ſuch a comi-
cal Girl in my Life. But go on. I will, Mrs. ?er-
vis, ſaid I, as ſoon as I have open'd the Bundle; for
I was as brisk and as pert as could be, little thinking
who heard me.
Now here, Mrs. Žervis, ſaid I, are my ever worthy
Maſter's Preſents; and then l particulariz'd all thoſe
in the ſecond Bundle. `s -
After which, I turn'd to my own, and ſaid,
Now, Mrs. Žervis, comes poor Pamela's Bundle,
and a little one it is, to the others. Firſt, here is a
Calico Night-gown, that I uſed to wear o' Morn-
ings. Twill be rather too good for me when I get
home; but I muſt have ſomething. Then there is
a quilted Calimanco Coat, and a Pair of Stockens I
bought of the Pedlar, and my Straw-hat with blue
Strings; and a Remnant of Scots Cloth, which will
make two Shirts and two Shifts, the ſame I have on,
for my poor Father and Mother. And here are four
other Shifts, one the Fellow to that I have on ; ano-
ther pretty good one, and the other two old fine ones,
that will ſerve me to turn and wind with at home,
for they are not worth leaving behind me; and
here are two Pair of Shoes; I have taken the Lace
off, which I will burn, and may-be will as: Ine

What do you laugh for, Mrs. §ervis ſaid I.--
Why you are like an April Day; you cry and laugh
in a Breath. * * * * * . -
Well, let me ſeen; ay, here is a Cotton Handker-
chief I bought of the Pedlar; there ſhould be an-
other ſomewhere. O here it is . And here too are
my new-bought knit Mittens. And this is my new
Flannel Coat, the Fellow to that I have on. And in
this Parcel pinn'd together, are ſeveral Pieces of
printed Calico, Remnants of Silks, and ſuch-like,
that; if good Luck ſhould happen, and I ſhould
get Work, would ſerve for Robings and Facings,
and ſuch-like Uſes. And here too are a Pair of
Pockets; they are too fine for me; but I have no
worſe. Bleſs me! ſaid I, I did not think I had ſo many
good Things! - -
Well, Mrs. %rvis, ſaid I, you have ſeen all my
Store, and I will now ſit down, and tell you a Piece
of my Mind.
Be brief then, ſaid ſhe, my good Girl; for ſhe
was afraid, ſhe ſaid afterwards, that I ſhould ſay too
much. -
*
- Why then the Caſe is this: I am to enter upon a
Point of Equity and Conſcience, Mrs. Žervis ; and I
muſt beg, if you love me, you'd let me have my
own Way. Thoſe Things there of my Lady's, I can
have no Claim to, ſo as to take them away; for ſhe
gave them me, ſuppoſing I was to wear them in her
Service, and to do Credit to her bountiful Heart.
: But ſince I am to be turn’d away, you know, I can-
not wear them at my poor Father's; for I ſhould
bring all the little Village upon my Back; and ſo I
reſolve not to have them. . . . .” -
Vo L. I. F Then,

<page 141>
98 P-4 M-E-L 43. Or,
Then, Mrs.jervis, ſaid I, I have far leſs Right te
theſe of my worthy Maſter's. For you ſee what was
his Intention in giving them to me. So they were to
be the Price of my Shame, and if I could make uſe
of them, I ſhould think I ſhould never proſper with
them; and beſides, you know, Mrs. Jervis, if I would
• not do the good Gentleman's Work, why ſhould I
* take his Wages? So in Conſcience, in É. in
everything, I have nothing to ſay to thee, thou ſecond
wicked Bundle!
But, ſaid I, come to my Arms, mydearthird Par-
cel, the Companion of my Poverty, and the Witneſs
of my Honeſty; and may I never deſerve the leaſt
; that is contain'd in thee, when I forfeit a Title
to that Innocence that I hope will ever be the Pride of
my Life 1 and then I am ſure it will be my higheſt
* Comfort at my Death, when all the Riches and Pomps
of the World will be worſe than the vileſt Rags that
i. }: worn by Beggars! And ſo I hugg'd my third
undle.
But, ſaid I, Mrs.jervis, (and ſhe wept to hear me)
one thing more I have to trouble you with, and that's
There are Four Guineas, you know, that came out
of my good Lady's Pocket, when ſhe dy'd, that, with
ſome Silver, my Maſter gave me: Now theſe ſame
Four Guineas I ſent to my poor Father and Mother,
and they have broken them; but would make them
up, if I would: And if you think it ſhould be ſo, it
ſhall. But pray tell me honeſtly, your Mind: As to
the Three Years before my Lady's Death, do you
think, as ºno Wº: may be ſuppos'd to be

ſaid I, and ſtept down; but that was only a Fetch to

ſaid, he thought two or three times to have burſt out
upon me; but he could not ſtand it, and wiſh’d I
might not know he was there. But I tript up again
ſo nimbly, (for there was no Paper) that I juſt ſaw
his Back, as if coming out of that Green Room, and
going into the next to it, the firſt Door that was open.
--I whipt in, and ſhut the Door and bolted it. O Mrs.

reſolv’d to begin firſt, with Submiſſion, to diſarm his

you hope to be forgiven yourſelf, and for the ſake of
my dear good Lady your Mother, who recommended
me to you with her laſt Words, to forgive me all m
Faults: And only grant me this Favour, the laſt

ſuch a Leave of my dear Fellow-ſervants as befits me;
and that my Heart be not quite broken. -
He took me up, in a kinder manner, than ever I
had known; and he ſaid, Shut the Door, Pamela,
and come to me in my Cloſet: I want to have a littlé

He then went into his Cloſet, which is his Library,

you in ſo ſuperior a Light, as ſpeaks what you ought
to be. I have ſeen more of your Letters than you
imagine, (This ſurpris'd me!) and am quite overcome
with your charming Manner of Writing, ſo free, ſo
eaſy, and many of your Sentiments ſo much above
your Years, and your Sex ; and all put together,
makes me, as I tell you, love you to Extravagance.
Now, Pamela, when I have ſtoop'd ſo low as to ac-

make no Doubt, Pamela, you will ſtay this Fortnight

ſo as to deny, and yet not make him ſtorm. But, ſaid
I, Forgive, Sir, your poor diſtreſſed Maiden. Iknow
I cannot poſſibly deſerve . Favour at your Hands,

may I ask you, can that be? Your Honour's noble
Eſtate may eaſily make him happy, and not unuſe-

what Price am P. pay for all this?---You ſhall be

depend upon it. I would have given you ſtill more for
him; but that perhaps you'd ſuſpect I intended it as a
Deſignupon you.--. O'Sir, ſaidſ, take backyour Gui-
neas; I will not touch one, nor will my Father, I am
ſure, till he knows what is to be done for them; and
particularly what is to become of me. Why then,
Pamela, ſaid he, ſuppoſe I find a Man of Probity and
genteel Calling for a Husband for you, that ſhall make
you a Gentlewoman as long as you live?--I want no
Husband, Sir, ſaid I; for now I began to ſee him in all
his black Colours! --- But being in his Power ſo, I
thought I would a little diſſemble. But, ſaid he, you
are ſo pretty, that go where you will, you'll never be

I ſhall think I don't anſwer the Care of my dying Mo-

provide you a Husband to protećt your Virtue and

of for you.

to think how to delude me better: But the Covering
was now toothin, and eaſy to be ſeen through.
I went to my Chamber, and the firſt thing I did,
was to write to him; for I thought it was beſt not
to ſee him again, if I could help it; and I put it
º: his Parlour-door, after I had copy’d it, as
ows:
* Honour’d sir,
& Y OU R laſt Propoſal to me convinces me, that
& I ought not to ſtay; but to go to my Father, if
• it were but to ask his Advice about Mr. Williams.
* And I am ſo ſet upon it, that I am not to be per-
* ſuaded. So, honour’d Šir, with a thouſand Thanks
* for all Favours, I will ſet out to-morrow early; and
• the Honour you deſign'd me, as Mrs. Žervis tells
me, of your Chariot, there will be no Occaſion for;
* becauſe I can hire, I believe, Farmer Brady's Chaiſe.
* So, beggingyou will not take it amiſs, I ſhall ever be
* 1ſour dutiful Servant.
* As to the Purſe, Sir, my poor Father, to be ſure,
‘ won't forgive me, if I take it,’till he can know
.* how to deſerve it. Which is impoſſible.”
So he hasjuſt now ſent Mrs. §ervis to tell me, That
ſince I am reſolv'd to go, go I may, and the tra-
velling Chariot ſhall be ready; but it ſhall be worſe
for me; for that he will never trouble himſelf about
me as long as he lives. Well, ſo I get out of the
Houſe, I care not; only I ſhould have been glad I
could, with Innocence, have made you, my dear Pa-
rents, happy.
I cannot imagine the Reaſon of it, but john, who
I thought was gone with my laſt, is but now going;
and he ſends to know if I have any thing elſe to

I will only add, that I am . -

Let me juſt ſay, That he has this Moment ſent me
Five Guineas by Mrs. Žervis, as a Preſent for

brought them, I thought I might take them. He
ſays he won't ſee me: And I may go when I will

body ſhall go out at the Door with me, not ſo

mela's Trials were not yet over; but the worſt of .
all were to come, at a Time when ſhe thought thematº
an Efid, and that ſhe was returning to her Father: For :
when her Maſter found her Virtue was not to be ſub- ?
du'd, and he had in vain try’d to conquer his Paſſion
for her, being a Gentleman of Pleaſure and Intrigue, he
had order'd his Lincolnſhire Coachman to bring his
travelling Chariot from thence, not caring to truſt his
Body Coachman, who, with the reſt of the Servants,
ſo greatly lov’d and honour’d the fair Damſel; and
having given him Inſtrućtions accordingly, and prohi-
bited his other Servants, on Pretence of reſenting Pa-
mela's Behaviour, from accompanying her any Part of
the Way, he drove her Five Miles on the Way to her
Father's; and then turning off, croſs'd the Country,
and carry'd her onward towardshis Lincolnſhire Eirí.

are determined to oppreſs? . - -
Well, but I will proceed to write what I had hoped
to tell you in a few Hours, that I believed I ſhould
receive your grateful Bleſſings, on my Return to you
from ſo many Hardſhips. . . . . . -
I will begin here with my Account from the laſt
etter I wrote you, in which I incloſed my poor Stuff
of Verſes; and continue it at times, as I have Oppor-
tunity; tho’, as I ſaid, I know not how it can reach
you now. -
The long hop'd-for Thurſday Morning came, that
I was to ſet out. I had taken my Leave of my Fel-
low-ſervants over-night; and a mournful Leave it
was to us all: For Men, as well as Women-ſervants,
wept much to part with me; and, for my Part, I was
overwhelm'd with Tears, and the affecting Inſtances
of their Eſteem. They all would have made me little
Preſents, as Tokens of their Love; but I would not
take any thing from the lower Servants, to be ſure.
But Mr. Longman made me a Preſent of ſeveral Yards
of Holland, and a Silver Snuff-box, and a Gold Ring,
which he deſir'd me to keep for his ſake; and he wept
over me; but ſaid, I am ſure, ſo good a Maiden God
will bleſs; and tho' you return to your poor Father
again, and his low Eſtate, yet Providence will find
you out; and one Day, tho’ I mayn’t live to ſee it,
you will be rewarded. -
I ſaid, O dear Mr. Longman, you make me too rich,
and too mody; and yet I muſt be a Beggar before my:
Time: For I ſhall want often to be ſcribbling, (little
thinking it would be my only Employment ſo ſoon)
and I will beg you, Sir, to favour mé with ſome Pa-
er; and as É. as I get home, I will write you a
etter, to thank you for all your Kindneſs to me; and
a Letter to good Mrs. 7ervis too. -

Mr. Longman gave me above forty Sheets of Paper,

I wrapt in Paper, and put in my Pocket; and ſome

Rachel and Hannah cry’d ſadly when I took my
Leave, and jane, who ſometimes uſed to be a little
croſfiſh, and Cicely too, wept ſadly, and ſaid they
would pray for me; but º: # doubt, ſeldom

Then Arthur the Gardener, our Robin the Coach-
man, and Lincolnſhire Robin too, who was to carry
me, were very civil ; and both had Tears in their
Eyes; which I thought then very good-natur'd in Lin-
colnſhire Robin, becauſe he knew but little of me.---
But ſince, I find he might well be concern’d; for he
had then his Inſtructions, it ſeems, and knew how he
was to be a Means to entrap me. . . º
Then our other three Footmen, Harry, Iſaac,
and Benjamin, and Grooms, and Helpers, were
very much affe&ted likewiſe; and the poor little
jº, Tommy, was ready to run over for
rief. -
They had got all together over-night, expecting
to be differently employ'd in the Morning; and they
all begg'd to ſhake Hands with me, and I kiſs'd the
Maidens, and pray'd to God to bleſs them all; and
thanked them for all their Love and Kindneſſes to

than I would, becauſe I could not ſtand it: Indeed I
could not. Harry (I could not bave thought it; for
he is a little wildiſh, they ſay) cry'd till he ſobb’d again.

from you. But as for the Butler, Mr.jonathan, he
could not ſtay in Company. . . . -
I thought to have told you a deal about this; but I
have worſe things to employ my Thoughts. . . . .
Mrs. Žervis, º: Mrs. Žervis, cry’d all Night
long; and I comforted her all I could : and ſhe made
me promiſe, that if my Maſter went to London to
attend Parliament, or to Lincolnſhire, I would come
and ſtay a Week with her. And ſhe would have given
me Money; but I would not take it. -
... Well, next Morning came, and I wonder'd I ſaw
nothing of poor honeſt jobn; for I waited to take
Leave of him, and thank him for all his Civilities to
me and to you: But I ſuppoſe he was ſent further by
my Maſter, and ſo could not return; and I deſired to
be remember'd to him.
And when Mrs. 7ervis told me, with a ſad Heart,
the Chariot was ready, with four Horſes to it, I was
juſt upon ſinking into the Ground, tho’ I wanted to:
be with you.
My Maſter was above Stairs, and never asked to
ſee me... I was glad of it in the main; but he knew,
falſe Heart as he is that I was not to be out of his
Reach.----O preſerve me, Heaven, from his Power,
and from his Wickedneſs!
... Well, they were not ſuffer'd to #. with me one
Step, as I writ to you before; for he ſtood at the Win--
dow to ſee me go. And in the Paſſage to the Gate,
out of his Sight, there they ſtood all of them, in two
Rows; and we could ſay nothing on both Sides, but,

128 P A M E L A; Or,
God bleſs you! and God bleſ; you! But Harry carried
my own Bundle, my third Bundle, as I was uſed to
call it, to the Čoach, and ſome Plum-cakes, and
Diet-bread, made for me over-night, and ſome
Sweat-meats, and ſix Bottles of Canary Wine, which
Mrs. 7ervis would make me take in a Basket, to
chear our Hearts now-and-then when we got toge-
ther, as ſhe ſaid. And I kiſſed all the Maids again,
and ſhook Hands with the Men again; but Mr. fona-
than and Mr. Longman were not there; and then I
tript down Steps to the Chariot, Mrs. Jervis crying
moſt ſadly.
I look’d up when I got to the Chariot, and I ſaw
my Maſter at the Window, in his Gown; and I
curt’ſy'd three times to him very low, and pray'd for
him with my Hands lifted up; for I could not ſpeak;
indeed I was not able. And he bow’d his Head to
me, which made me then very glad he would take
ſuch Notice of me; and in I ſtept, and was ready to
burſt with Grief; and could only, till Robin began to
drive, wave my white Handkerchief to them, wet
with my Tears. And at laſt away he drove, jehu-like,
as they ſay, out of the Court-yard: And I too ſoon
found I had Cauſe for greater and deeper Grief.
Well, ſaid I to myſelf, at this rate I ſhall ſoon be
with my dear Father and Mother; and till I had got,
as I ſuppoſed, half-way, I thought of the good Friends
I had left. And when, on ſtopping for a little Bait
to the Horſes, Robin told me, f was near half-way,
I thought it was high time to wipe my Eyes, and
think to whom I was going; as then, alack for me!
I thought. So I began to ponder what a Meeting
I ſhould have with you; how glad you’d both be
to ſee me come ſafe and innocent to you, after
all my Dangers; and ſo I began to comfort my-
ſelf, and to baniſh the other gloomy: Side from
my Mind; tho’, too, it return’d now-and-then; for

Well, I believe, I ſet out abºut Eight o’Clock in
the Morning; and I wonder'd, and wonder'd, when
it was about Two, as I ſaw by a Church-dial in a
little Village we paſs'd thro’, that I was ſtill more and
more out of my Knowledge. Hey-day! thought I, to .
drive this ſtrange Pace, and to be ſo long a-going little
more Khan twenty Miles, is very odd! But, to be ſure, ,
thought I, Robin knows the Way. * . . . ."
At laſt he ſtopt, and look’d abouti him, as if he
was at a Loſs for the Way ; and I ſaid, Mr. Robert, ,
ſure you are out of the Way !-- I'm afraid I am,
ſaid he. But it can’t be much ; I'll ask the firſt
Perſon I ſee. Pray do, ſaid I; and he gave his
Horſes a Mouthful of Hay; and I gave him ſome
Cake, and two Glaſſes of Canary Wine; and ſtopt:
about half an Hour in all. Then he drove on very
faſt again. - -
... I had ſo much to think of, of the Dangers I now
doubted not I had eſcaped, of the loving Friends I
had left, and my beſt Friends I was going to, and
the manythings I had to relate to you; that I the
leſs thought of the Way, till I was ſtartled out of
my Meditations by the Sun beginning to ſet, and ſtill
the Man driving on, and his Horſes ſweating and
foaming; and then I began to be alarm'd all at once,
and callſd to him; and he ſaid he had horrid ill Luck,
for he had come ſeveral Miles out of the Way, but
was now right, and ſhould get in ſtill before it was
quite dark, My Heart began then to miſgive me a
little, and I was very much fatigued; for I had noSleep
for ſeveral Nights before, to ſignify; and at laſt Iſaid, .
Pray, Mr. Robert, there is a Town before us; what
do you call it?---If we are ſo much out of the Way, ,
we had better put up there; for the Night comes on
apace; And, Lord protećt me! thought I, I ſhall -

Town before us --- Nay, ſaid I, I may be miſtaken;
for, it is a good while fince I was this Way; but I am
ſure the Face of the Country here is nothing like what
I remember it. * . .
He pretended to be much out of Humour with
himſelf for miſtaking the Way, and at laſt ſtopt at a
Farm-houſe, about two Miles beyond the Village I
had ſeen; and it was then almoſt dark, and he alighted,
and ſaid, We muſt make ſhift here; for I am quite

The Farmer's Wife, and Maid, and Daughter,
came out; and the Wife ſaid, What brings you this
Way at this time of Night, Mr. Robert And with a
Lady too?--Then I began to be frighten’d out of
Wits; and laying Middle' and both Ends º
fell a crying, and ſaid, God give me Patience ... I am
undone for certain ---Pray, Miſtreſs, ſaid I, do you
know Eſquire B. of Bedfºrd hire * . . . . . . .
The wicked Coachman would have prevented the

could not help it. But make the beſt of it now;
here are very civil, reputable Folks; and you'll be ſafe

The good Woman (for I began to ſee Things

offered me a Glaſs of ſome cordial Water, which
accepted, for I was ready to ſink; and then I ſat up in
a Chair a little, tho’ very faintiſh: And they brought
me two Candles, and lighted a Bruſh-wood Fire; and .
ſaid, If I call'd, I ſhould be waited upon inſtantly; .
and ſo left me to ruminate on my ſad Condition, and
to read my Letter, which I was not able to do pre--
ſently. After I had a little come to myſelf, I found it :

I but too well apprehended, that this Letter was
only to pacify me for the preſent; but as my Danger
was not ſo immediate as I had Reaſon to dread, and
he had promiſed to forbear coming to me, and to
write to you, my dear Parents, to quiet your Con-
cern, I was a little more eaſy than I was before: And
I made ſhift to eat a little Bit of boil’d Chicken they
had got for me, and drank a Glaſs of my Sack, and
made each of them do ſo too. - - -
But after I had ſo done, I was again a little flu-
ſter'd; for in came the Coachman with the Look
of a Hangman, I thought, and Madam'd me up
ſtrangely; telling me, he would beg me to get ready
to purſue my Journey, by Five in the Morning, or
elſe he ſhould be late in. I was quite griev'd at this;
for I began not to diſlike my Company, conſidering
how Things ſtood, and was in Hopes to get a Party
among them, and ſo to put myſelf into any worthy
Protećtion in the Neighbourhood, rather than go
forward. -
When he withdrew, I began to tamper with
the Farmer and his Wife. But, alas ! they had had
a Letter deliver'd them at the ſame time I had; ſo
ſecurely had Lucifer put it into his Head to do his

Farmer was ſo prepoſſeſs'd with the Contents of
his Letter to him, that he began to praiſe his Care
and Concern for me, and to adviſe me againſt en-
tertaining Addreſſes without my Friends Advice and
Conſent, and made me the Subjećt of a Leſſon for
his Daughter's Improvement. So I was glad to ſhut
up this Diſcourſe; for I ſaw I was not likely to be
believ'd.
I ſent, however, to tell my Driver, that I was ſo
fatigued, I could not ſet out ſo ſoon the next Morn-
ing. But he inſiſted upon it, and ſaid, It would make
my Day's Journey the lighter; and I found he was a
more faithful Servant to his Maſter, notwithſtanding
what he wrote of his Reluctance, than I could have
wiſh’d: So I ſaw ſtill more and more, that all was
deep Diſfimulation, and Contrivance worſe and
worſe.
Indeed I might have ſhewn them his Letter to
me, as a full Confutation of his to them; but I ſaw
no Probability of engaging them in my Éehalf ; and
ſo thought it ſignify’d little, as I was to go away ſo
ſoon, to enter more particularly into the Matter with
them; and beſides, I ſaw they were not inclinable to
let me ſtay longer for fear of diſobliging him: So I
went to Bed, but had very little Reſt: And they
would make their Servant-maid bear me Company in
the Chariot five Miles, early in the Morning, and ſhe
was to walk back.
I had contriv'd in my Thoughts, when I was on
my Way in the Chariot, on Friday Morning, that
when we came into ſome Town, to bait, as he muſt
do for the Horſes ſake, I would, at the Inn, apply
myſelf, if I ſaw I any way could, to the Mā; of
the Inn, and tell her the Caſe, and refuſe to go far-

contend with.

her Siſter-in-law was the Miſtreſs of it; and ſhe had
provided a little Entertainment for me. -
And this I found, when I deſir'd, as ſoon as I.
came in, to ſpeak with the Miſtreſs of the Houſe.
She came to me, and I ſaid, I am a poor unhappy
young Body, that want your Advice and Aſſiſtance;
and you ſeem to be a good ſort of Gentlewoman,

Well, thought I, here are ſtrange Pains taken to

too long a hatching, to be baffled, I fear. But then I
put my Truſt in God, who I knew was able to do
every thing for me, when all other poſſible Means
fhould fail; And in Him I was reſolv’d to confide.

I’ll aſſure you, Madam, ſaid ſhe, I ſhould be as
ready to cry as he, if I ſhould do you any Harm. It
is not in his Power to help it now, ſaid I; but your
Part is to come, and you may chuſe whether you’ll
contribute to my Ruin or not.—Why, look ye, look
ye, Madam, ſaid ſhe, I have a great Notion of doing
my Duty to my Maſter; and therefore you may de-
pend upon it; if I can do that, and ſerve you, I will:

Something, and now Nothing, juſt as that thinks fit
to ſport with me: And let you and me talk upon a
Foot together; for I am a Servant inferior to you;
and ſo much the more as "I am turn’d out of
Place.
Ay, ay, ſays ſhe, I underſtand ſomething of the

would oblige you, if I could. And I muſt and will
call you Madam; for I am inſtructed to ſhew you all
Reſpect, I'll aſſure you.
S.Who inſtrućted you to do ſo? ſaid I. Who: my
Maſter, to be ſure, ſaid ſhe. Why, ſaid I, how cań.
that be? You have not ſeen him lately. No, that’s
true, ſaid ſhe; but l have been expecting you here
ſome time (O the deep-laid Wickedneſs I thought
I); and beſides, I have a Letter of Inſtructions by
Robin; but, may-be, I ſhould not have ſaid ſo much.
If you would ſhew them to me, ſaid I, I ſhould be
able to judge how far I could, or could not, expect
Favour from you, conſiſtent with your Duty to our
Maſter. I beg your Pardon, fair Miſtreſs, for that,
ſaid ſhe; I am ſufficiently inſtructed, and you may
depend upon it, I will obſerve my Orders; and ſo
far as they will let me, ſo far will I oblige you; and
there's an End of it.
... Well, ſaid I, you will not, I hope, do an unlaw-
ful or wicked thing, for any Maſter in the World.
Look-ye, ſaid ſhe, he is my Maſter; and if he bids
me do a thing that I can do, I think I ought to do
it; and let him, who has flower to command me,
look to the Lawfulneſs of it. Why, ſaid I, ſuppoſe
he ſhould bid you cut my Throat, would you do it?
There's no Danger of that, ſaid ſhe; but to be ſure
I would not; for then I ſhould be hang'd; for that `
would be Murder. Well, ſaid I, an º: he
ſhould reſolve to enſnare a #. young Creature,
and ruin her, would you aſſiſt him in that? For to
rob a Perſon of her Virtue, is worſe than cutting her
Throat. -
Why now, ſays ſhe, how ſtrangely you talk!, Are
not the two Sexes made for one another? And is it
not natural for a Gentleman to love a pretty Woman?
And ſuppoſe he can obtain his Deſires, is that ſo bad
as cutting her. Throat? And then the wied º

So we ended our Diſcourſe here, and I bid her
ſhew me where I muſt lie. --- Why, ſaid ſhe, lie

Torture then wrung my Heart!-- But is it in your
Inſtrućtions that you muſt lie with me?...Yes, indeed,
ſaid ſhe. I am ſorry for it, ſaid I. Why, ńid ſhe,
I am wholſome and cleanly too, I'll aſſure you. Yes,
ſaid I, I don't doubt that; but I love to lie by myſelf.
How ſo? ſaid ſhe was not Mrs. Žervis your Bed-

Now I will give you a Pićture of this Wretch:
She is a broad, ſquat, purſy, fat Thing, quite ugly,
if any thing human can be ſo called; i: forty
Years old. She has a huge Hand, and an Arm as
thick as my Waiſt, I believe. Her Noſe is flat and
crooked, and her Brows grow over her Eyes; a dead,
ſpiteful, grey, goggling Eye, to be ſure ſhe has. And
her Face is flat and broad; and as to Colour, looks
, like as if it had been picked a Month in Salt-petre:
I dare ſay ſhe drinks!---She has a hoarſe man-like
Voice, and is as thick as ſhe's long; and yet looks ſo
deadly ſtrong, that I am afraid ſhe would daſh me at
her Foot in an Inſtant, if I was to vex her. ---So that
with a Heart more ugly than her Face, ſhe frightens

which he had preſcrib'd, it would look like placing a
Confidence in Mrs.jewkes, to ſhew them to her; and
I ſhew’d her at the ſame time my Maſter’s Letter to

which I took up without Mrs. Žewkes's ſeeing me; ,
but I was a thouſand times more ſurpris'd, when f :
return'd to my Cloſet, and opening it, read as s
follows:
Good Mrs. PAMELA,
- IAM griev'd to tell you how much you have -
* * been deceiv'd and betray'd, and that by ſuch as,
* vile Dog as I. Little did I think it would come to ,
* this. But I muſt ſay, if ever there was a Rogue in ,
* the World, it is me. I have all along ſhew'd your-
* Letters to my Maſter: He employ'd me for that:
* Purpoſe; and he ſaw every one before I carry'd :
: them to your Father and Mother, and then ſeal’d
* them up, and ſent me with them. I had ſome Buſi-
‘neſs that way; but not half ſo often as I pretended.
* And as ſoon as I heard how it was with you, I was
: ready to hang myſelf. You may well think I could :
* not ſtand in your Preſence. G vile, vileywretch,
* to bring you to this! If you are ruin'd, I am the .
* Rogue that caus'd it. . All the Juſtice I can do you, .
* is, to tell you, you are invile Hands; and I am afraid :
* will be undone in ſpite of all your ſweet Innocence; ,
* and I believe I ſhall never live after I know it. If f
* you can forgive me, you are exceeding good; but I
* ſhall never forgive myſelf, that’s certain. How- -
‘ ſomever, it will do younogood to make this known; ,
* and may-hap I may live to do you Service. If I can, ,
* I will. I am ſure I ought --- Maſter kept your laſt
* two or three Letters, and did not ſend them at all. .
‘ I am the moſt abandon'd Wretch of Wretches,

* Pray take care of your ſweet Self. Mrs.
c Ž. is a Devil: But in my Maſter's t'other
* Houſe you have not one falſe Heart, but my-
* ſelf. Out upon me for a Villain : *
My dear Father and Mother, when you come to
this Place, I make no doubt your Hair will ſtand
on End, as mine does!--- O the Deceitfulneſs of
the Heart of Man!---This john, that I took to-be
the honeſteſt of Men; that you took for the fame;
that was always praiſing you to me, and me to you,
and for nothing ſo much as for our homeſt Hearts;
this very Fellow was all the while a vile Hypocrite,
and a perfidious Wretch, and helping to carry on
my Ruin. -
But he ſays enough of himſelf; and I can only ſit
down with this ſad Refle&tion, That Power and
Riches never want Tools to promote their vileſt Ends,
and that there is nothing ſo hard to be known as the
Heart of Man!—Yet I can but pity the poor Wretch,
fince he ſeems to have ſome Remorſe, and I believe
it beſt to keep his Wickedneſs ſecret, and, if it lies
in my way, to encourage his Penitence; for I may
poſſibly make ſome Diſcoveries by it. .
One thing I ſhould mention in this Place; he
brought down, in a Portmanteau, all the Cloaths and
Things my Lady and Maſter had given me, and more-
over two Velvet Hoods, and a Velvet Scarf, that uſed
to be worn by my Lady; but I have no Comfort in
them, or any thing elſe.
Mrs. Jewkes had the Portmanteau brought into my
Cloſet, and ſhe ſhew'd me what was in it; but then
lock'd' it up, and ſaid, ſhe would let me have what I
would out of it, when I asked; but if I had the Key
it might make me want to go abroad, may-be; and
ſo the inſolent Woman put it in her Pocket.
I gave

I gave myſelf over to ſad Refle&tions upon this
ſtrange and ſurprizing Diſcovery of john's, and wept
much for him, and for myſelf too; and now I ſee, as ,
he ſays, my Ruin has been ſo long a hatching, that I
can make no Doubt what my Maſter's honourable Pro-
feſſions will end in. What a Heap of Names does the
poor Fellow call himſelf! But what muſt they deſerve,
who ſet him to work? O what has this wicked Maſter
to anſwer for, to be ſo corrupt himſelf, and to corrupt
others, who would have been innocent; and all to car-
on further a more corrupt Scene, and to ruin a poor "
reature, who never did him Harm, nor wiſh’d him
any; and who ſtill can pray for his Happineſs, and
his Repentance?
1 can but wonder what theſe Gentlemen, as they are
called, canthink of themſelves for theſe vile Doings?
john had ſome Inducement; for he hoped to pleaſe his
Maſter, who rewarded him, and was bountiful to him;
and the ſame may be ſaid, bad as ſhe is, for this ſame
odious Mrs. Jewkes. But what Inducement has m
Maſter for taking ſo much Pains to do the Devil's
Work?--If he loves me, as 'tis falſly called, muſt he
therefore lay Traps for me, to ruin me, and to make
me as bad as himſelf? I cannot imagine what Good the
Undoing of ſuch a poor Creature as I can procure him!
--To be ſure, I am a very worthleſs Body. People
indeed ſay I am handſome; but if I was ſo, ſhould not
a Gentleman prefer an honeſt Servant to a guilty Har-
lot?---And muſt he be more earneſt to ſeduce me, ber
cauſe I dread of all Things to be ſeduced, and would
rather loſe my Life than my Honeſty! -
Well, theſe are ſtrange Things to me! I cannot
account for them, for my Share; but ſure nobody
will ſay, that theſe fine Gentlemen have any Tempter
but their own wicked Wills!—This naughty Maſter
could run away from me, iºn he thought none ‘.

ſad Cloſet Affair; but is it not ſtrange, that fleſholā
not be afraid of the All-ſeeing Eye, from which even
that black poiſonous Heart of his, and its moſt ſecret
Motions, could not be hid?--- But what avail me
theſe ſorrowful Refleštions? He is and will be wicked,

TUESDA1 and W.E.D.NESDA r.
I Have been hinder'd, by this wicked Woman's
watching me too cloſe, from writing on Tueſday;
and ſo I will put both theſe Days together. I have
been a little Turn with her, for an Airing, in the
Chariot, and walked ſeveral times in the Garden;
but have always her at my Heels.
Mr. Williams came to ſee us, and took a Walk with
us once; and while her Back was juſt turn'd, (encou-
#. by the Hint he had before given me) f ſaid, Sir,
I ſee two Tiles upon that j Cannot One
cover them with Mould, with a Note between them,
on Occaſion?—A good Hint, ſaid he; let that Sun-
flower by the Back-door of the Garden be the Place;
I have a Key to that; for it is my neareſt way to the
Town. -
So I was forced to begin. O what Inventions
will Neceſſity be the Parent of! I huggid myſelf
with the Thought; and ſhe coming to us, he ſaid,
as if he was continuing the Diſcourſe we were in;
No, not extraordinary pleaſant. What's that P what's
that? ſaid Mrs. Žewkes.---Only, ſaid he, the Town
I’m ſaying, is not very pleaſant. No, indeed, àid
ſhe, 'tis not; 'tis a poor Town, to my thinking.
Aréthere any Gentry in it? ſaid L. And ſo we “.

ted on about the Town, to deceive her. But my
Deceit intended no Hurt to any body. -
* We then talked of the Garden, how large and
§. and the like; and ſat down on the turfted
lope of the fine Fiſh-pond, to ſee the Fiſhes play
upon the Surface of the Water; and ſhe ſaid, I
ſhould angle if I would.
I wiſh, ſaid I, you'd be ſo kind to fetch me a
Rod and Baits. Pretty Miſtreſs! ſaid ſhe---I know
better than that, I’ll aſſure you, at this time.---I mean
no Harm, ſaid I, indeed. Let me tell you, ſaid ſhe,
I know no one that has their Thoughts more about
them than you. A body ought to look to it, where
you are. But we'll e a little to-morrow. Mr.
Williams, who is much afraid of her, turn'd the Diſ-
courſe to a general Subjećt. I ſaunter'd in, and left
them to É by themſelves; but he went away to
Town, and ſhe was ſoon after me.
I had got to my Pen and Ink; and I ſaid, I want
ſome Paper (putting what I was about in my Bo-
ſom): You know I have written two Letters, and ſent
them by john (O how his Name, poor guilty Fel-
low, grieves me!), Well, ſaid ſhe, you have ſome
left; one Sheet did for thoſe two Letters. Yes, ſaid
I; but I uſed half another for a Wrapper, you know;
and ſee how I have ſcribbled the other º3.
- and ſo f
ſhewed her a Parcel of broken Scraps of Verſes
which I had tºyd to recoiled, and which f had
written purpoſely that ſhe might ſee, and think me
- *". employ'd to ſuch idle Purpoſes. Ay, ſaid
fhe, ſo you have; well, I'll give you two Sheets
more; but let me ſee how you diſpoſe of them,
either written or blank. Well, thought I, I hope ſtill,
Argus, to be too hard for thee. Now Argus, the
Poets ſay, had an hundred Eyes, and was made to
watch with themail, as fiedº.” ---
She

<page 201>
158 P A M E L A; Or,
She brought me the Paper, and ſaid, Now, Ma-
dam, let me ſee you write ſomething I will, ſaid
I; and took the Pen, and wrote, “ I wiſh Mrs.
“ jewkes would be as good to me, as I would be to
“her, if I had it in my Power!”—That's pretty
now! ſaid ſhe ; well, I hope I am; but what then P
“Why then (wrote I) ſhe would do me the Favour
“ to let me know, what I have done to be made her
“Priſoner; and what ſhe thinks is to become of me.”
Well, and what then P ſaid ſhe, “Why then, of
“Conſequence, (ſtribbled I) ſhe would let me ſee
“ her Inſtrućtions, that I may know far to blameher,
“ or acquit her.” -.
Thus I fooled on, to ſhew her my Fondneſs for
ſcribbling; for I had no Expectation of any Good
from her; that ſo ſhe might ſuppoſe I employ'd my-
ſelf, as I ſaid, to no better Purpoſe at other Times:
For ſhe will have it, that I am upon the ſome Plot, I
am ſo ſilent, and love ſo much to be myſelf. ---
She would have me write on a little further. No,
ſaid I, you have not anſwer'd me. Why, ſaid ſhe,
what can you doubt, when my Maſter himſelf aſſures
you of his Honour? Ay, ſaid I; but lay your Hand
to your Heart, Mrs.jewkes, and tell me, if you your-
ſelf believe him. Yes, ſaid ſhe, to be ſure I do.
But, ſaid I, what do you call Honour?---Why, ſaid
ſhe, what does he call Honour, think you?—Ruin!
Shame! Diſgrace! ſaid I, I fear.---Pho, phoſ ſaid
ſhe; if you have any Doubt about it, he can beſt ex-
plain his own Meaning:—I’ll ſend him Word to come
to ſatisfy you, if you will.---Horrid Creature! ſaid I,
all in a Fright—Can'ſt thou not ſtab me to the Heart 1
I'd rather thou wouldſt, than ſay ſuch another Word!
—But I hope there is no Thought of his coming.
She had the Wickedneſs to #. No, no; he don't
intend to come, as I know of:--But if ſº .

-
I would not be long away.--—What means the Wo-
man? ſaid I.---Mean I ſaid ſhe (turning it off); why
I mean, I would come, if I was he, and put an End
to all your Fears---by making you as happy as you
wiſh. 'Tis out of his Power, ſaid I, to make me
happy, great and rich as he is but by leaving me in-
nocent, and giving me Liberty to go to my dear Fa-
ther and Mother. *
She went away ſoon after, and I ended my Letter,
in Hopes to have an Opportunity to lay it in the ap-
pointed Place. So I went to her, and ſaid; I ſup-
poſe, as it is not dark, I may take another Turn in
the Garden. Tis too late, ſaid ſhe ; but if you will
go, don't ſtay; and, Nam, ſee and attend Madam, as
ſhe called me.
So I went towards the Pond, the Wench follow-
ing me, and dropt purpoſely my Huſſey: And
when I came near the Tiles, I ſaid, Mrs. Ann, I
have dropt my Huſſey; be ſo kind as to look for it:
I had it by the Pond-ſide. The Wench went to
look, and I ſlipt the Note between the Tiles, and
cover'd them as quick, as I could with the light
Mould, quite unperceiv'd ; and the Maid finding the
Huſſey, } took it, and ſaunter'd in again, and met
Mrs.jewkes coming to ſee after me. What I wrote
was this:

But I muſt tell you, firſt, how I have been beaten by
Mrs.jewkes 1’Tis very true!–And thus it came about:
My Impatience was great to walk in the Garden, to
ſee if anything had offer'd, anſwerable to my Hopes.
But this wicked Mrs. Žewkes would not let me go
without her; and ſhe ſaid ſhe was not at Leiſure. We
had a great many Words about it; for I ſaid, it was
very hard I could not be truſted to walk by myſelf in
the Garden for a little Air; but muſt be dogg’d and
watch'd worſe than a Thief. S}

She ſtill pleaded her Inſtrućtions, and ſaid ſhe was
not to truſt me out of her Sight: And you had better,
ſaid ſhe, be eaſy and contented, I aſſure you; for I
have worſe Orders than you have yet found. I re-
member, ſaid ſhe, your asking Mr. Williams if there
were any Gentry in the Neighbourhood: This makes
me ſuſpect you want to get away to them, to tell your
ſad diſmal Story, as you call it.
My Heart was at my Mouth; for I fear'd by that
Hint, ſhe had ſeen my Letter under the Tiles: O
how uneaſy I was . At laſt ſhe ſaid, Well, ſince you
take ſo on, you may take a Turn, and I will be with
you in a Minute. -
I went out; and when I was out of Sight of her
Window, I ſpeeded towards the hopeful Place; but
was ſoon forced to ſlacken my Pace, by her odious
Voice; Hey-day, why ſo nimble, and whither ſo faſt?
ſaid ſhe: What I are you upon a Wager ? I ſtopt for
her, till her purſy Sides were waddled up to me; and
ſhe held by my Arm, half out of Breath: So I was
forced to paſs by the dear Place, without daring to
look at it.
The Gardener was at Work a little further, and ſo
we looked upon him, and I began to talk about his
Art; but ſhe ſaid ſoftly, My Inſtrućtions are, not to
let you be ſo familiar with the Servants. Why, ſaid
I, are you afraid I ſhould confederate with them to
commit a Robbery upon my Maſter? May-be I am,
ſaid the odious Wretch; for to rob him of yourſelf,
would be the worſt that could happen to him, in his
Opinion. -
And pray, ſaid I, walking on, how came I to be
his Property P What Right has he in me, but ſuch as
a Thief may plead to ſtolen Goods?—-Why, was
ever the like heard, ſays ſhe'—This is downright
Rebellion, I proteſt!—Well, well, Lambkin, (wº

the Fooliſh often calls me) if I was in his Place, he
ſhould not have his Property in you long queſtion-
able. Why, what would you do, ſaid I, if you were
he 2–Not ſtand ſhill-I, ſhall-I, as he does; but put
you and himſelf both out of your Pain.--Why, je-
zebel, ſaid I, (I could not help it) would you ruin
me by Force?---Upon this ſhe gave me a deadly Slap
upon my Shoulder:Take that, ſaid ſhe; whom do you
call jezebel? -
I was ſo ſurpris'd, (for you never beat me, my dear
Father and Mother, in your Lives) that I was as
one thunder-ſtruck; and looked round, as if I
wanted ſomebody to help me; but, alas! I had no-
body; and ſaid, at laſt, rubbing my Shoulder, Is
this alſo in your Inſtructions --Alas! for me! am
I to be beaten too? And ſo I fell a-crying, and threw
myſelf upon the Graſs-walk we were upon.---Said
ſhe, in a great Pet, I won’t be call’d ſuch Names,
I'll aſſure you. Marry come up! I ſee you have a
Spirit: You muſt and ſhall be kept under. I’ll ma-
nage ſuch little provoking Things as you, I warrant

I did not know what to do. This was a cruel thing
to me, and I blam'd myſelf for my free Speech; for
now I had given her ſome Pretence; and Oh! thought
I, here I have, by my Malpertneſs, ruin'd the only
Projećt I had left. -
The Gardener ſaw this Scene; but ſhe called to

what you're upon. And away he walk'd, to another
Quarter, out of Sight. -
Well, thought I, I muſt put on the Diſſembler a

Pañon, I ſaw, and I was out of my Wits. Thought
I, I have often heard Women blam'd for their

do, ſaid I, too well; and will you not uſe me worſe-
when I come in 2--- So †. and ſhe mutter'd to
herſelf all the way, She to be a jezebel with me, that
had uſed me ſo well and ſuch-like.
When I came near the Houſe, I ſaid, ſitting downs
upon a Settle-bench, Well, I will not go in, till you:
ſay, you will forgive me, Mrs. Žewkes.--If you will:
forgive my calling you that Name, I will forgive your
beating me.--- She ſat down by me, and ſeem'd in a
great Pucker, and ſaid, Well, come, I will forgive

am to walk, and go, and give me what Liberty you

ought to bear it. I ſay, love, ſaid Il Come, ſaid ſhe,

am ſure; and I’ll ſend her, and you ſhall take ano-
ther Walk in the Garden, if you will: May-be,
ſaid ſhe, it will get you a Stomach to your Dinner;
for you don't eat enough to keep Life and Soul to-
gether. You are Beauty to the Bone, added the
ſtrange Wretch, or you could not look ſo well as you
do, with ſo little Stomach, ſo little Reſt, and ſo much
Fº and whining for nothing at all. Wei, thought
2 ſay what thou wilt, ſo I can be rid of thy bad
Tongue and Company: And I hop'd to find ſome
Opportunity now, to come at my Sun-flower. But
I walked the other way, to take that in my Return, to
avoid Suſpicion.
I forced my Diſcourſe to the Wench; but it was
all upon general things; for I find ſhe is asked after
| every thing I ſay and do. When I came near the
Place, as I had been deviſing, I ſaid, Pray, ſtep to the
‘Gardener, and ask him to gather a Sallad for me to
Dinner. She called out, #. !-- Said I, he can’t
Thear you ſo far off; and pray tell him, I ſhould like a
Cucumber too, if he has one. When ſhe had ſlept
about a Bow-ſhot from me, I popt down, and whipt
my Fingers under the upper Tile, and pulled out a
Letter, without Direétion, and thruſt it in my Boſom,
trembling for Joy. She was with me before I could
well ſecure it; and I was in ſuch a taking, that I feared
I ſhould diſcover myſelf. You ſeem frighted, Ma-
dam, ſaid ſhe Why, ſaid I, with a lucky Thought,
(alas' your poor Daughter will make an Intriguer by-
and-by ; but I hope an innocent one!) I ſtoop'd to
ſmell at the Sun-flower, and a great naſty Worm ran
into the Ground, that ſtartled me ; for I don't love
Worms. Said ſhe, Sun-flowers don’t ſmell. So I
find, reply'd I. And ſo we walked in; and Mrs.

ſhall go another time.

I had time but juſt to tranſcribe this, before I was
called to Dinner; and I put that for Mr. Williams,
with a Wafer in it, in my Boſom, to get an Oppor-
tunity to # it in the dear Place. - -
O'good Sirs! Of all the Flowers in the Garden,
the Sun-flower, ſure, is the lovelieſt 1---It is a pro-
itious one to me! How º my Plot ſucceeds !
}. I begin to be afraid my Writings may be diſ-
cover'd; for they grow large: Iſtitch them hitherto
in my Under-coat, next my Linen. But if this Brute
£hould ſearch me !--I muſt try to pleaſe her, and then
ſhe won’t.
Well, I am but juſt come off from a Walk in
the Garden ; and have depoſited my Letter by a
fimple Wile. I got ſome Horſe-beans ; and we
took a Turn in the Garden, to angle, as Mrs.
ewkes had promis'd me. She baited the Hook, and
held it, and ſoon hooked a lovely Carp. Play it,
Vol. I, I play

<page 213>
I fo P A M E L A ; Or,
play it, ſaid ſhe ; I did, and brought it to the Bank.
A ſad Thought juſt then came into my Head ; and
I took it, and threw it in again ; and O the Plea-
ſure it ſeem'd to have, to flounce in, when at Li-
berty?--Why this?, ſays ſhe. O Mrs.jewkes 1 ſaid
I, I was thinking this poor Carp was the unhappy
Pamela. , I was likening, you and myſelf to my
naughty Maſter. As we hooked and deceived the
poor Carp, ſo was I betrayed by falſe Baits; and
when you ſaid, Play it, play it, it went to my Heart,
to think I ſhould ſport with the Deſtruction of the
poor Fiſh I had betray’d ; and I could not but fling it
in again: And did you not ſee the Joy with which
the happy Carp flounced from us! O! ſaid I, may
ſome good merciful Body procure me my Li-
berty in the ſame manner ; for, to be ſure, I think
my 5. equal - - *
Lord bleſs thee! ſaid ſhe, what a Thought is there!
---Well, ſaid I, I can angle no more. I’ll try m
Fortune, ſaid ſhe, and took the Rod. Well, ſaid I,
I will plant Life then, if I can, while you are de-
ſtroying it. I have ſome Horſe-beans here, and
will go and ſtick them into one of the Borders, to
ſee how long they will be coming up; and I will
call them my Garden. -
So you ſee, dear Father and Mother, (I hope now
you will ſoon ſee; for, may-be, if I can’t get away
ſo ſoon myſelf, I may ſend my Papers ſome-how ;
I ſay, you will ſee) that this furniſhes me withagood
Excuſe to look after my Garden another time; and
if the Mould ſhould look a little freſhiſh, it won't
be ſo much ſuſpected. She miſtruſted nothing of
this ; and I went and ſtuck in here and there my
Beans, for about the Length of five Ells, of each
ſide of the Sun-flower ; and eaſily repoſited my
Letter. And not a little proud am I of this Con-
triyance. Sure ſomething will do at laſt! R I.

This Night the Man from the Poſt-houſe brought
a Letter for Mrs. Jewkes, in which was one in-
cloſed to me: She brought it me up. Said ſhe,
Well, my good Maſter don't forget us... He has
ſent you a Letter; and fee what he writes to me.
So ſhe read, That he hoped her fair Charge was
well, happy, and contented: Ay, to be ſure, ſaid I,
I can’t chuſe !---That he did not doubt her Care and
Kindneſs to me; that I was very dear to him, and
ſhe could not uſe me too well; and the like. There’s
a Maſter for you, ſaid ſhel Sure you will love and
pray for him. I deſir’d her to read the reſt. No, no,
ſaid ſhe, but I won't. Said "I, Are there any
Orders for taking my Shoes away, and for beating
me? No, ſaid ſhe, nor about jezebel neither. Well,

ewkes, any of my Beans can have ſtruck ſince

I have hinted your Caſe to Mr. Peters, the Mi-
niſter of this Pariſh ; but I am concern'd to ſay,
that he imputed ſelfiſh Views to me, as if I would
make an Intereſt in your Affections, by my Zeal.
And when I repreſented the Duties of our Fun-
&tion, and the like, and proteſted my Diſintereſt-
edneſs, he coldly ſaid, I was very good ; but was
a young Man, and knew little of the World, And
tho’’twas a Thing to be lamented, yet when he
and I ſet about to reform Mankind in this reſpect,
we ſhould have enough upon our Hands; for, he
ſaid, it was too common and faſhionable a Caſe to
be withſtood by a private Clergyman or two: And
then he utter’d ſome Refle&tions upon the Condućt
of the preſent Fathers of the Church, in regard
to the firſt Perſonages of the Realm, as a Juſtifi-
cation ef his Coldneſs on this ſcore.
* I repreſented the different Circumſtances of your
Affair ; , that other Women liv'd evilly by their
own Conſent; but to ſerve you, was to ſave an
Innocence that had but few £º: ; and then
I ſhew’d him your Letter. º

ought to be *...*. ; but what, ſaid he, would
you have me do, Mr. Williams ? Why, ſuppoſe

I'll aſſure you !---And I would have you confider

he, that he promiſes to do honourably by her; and
her Shyneſs will procure her good Terms enough;

: “I am greatly concern’d for him, I aſſure you ;
but am not diſcourag’d by this ill Succeſs, let what
will come of it, if I can ſerve you.
“I don’t hear, as yet, that Mr. B. is coming; I
am glad of your Hint as to that unhappy Fellow
john Arnold; ſomething, perhaps, will ſtrike out
from that, which may be uſeful. As to your
Pacquets, if you ſeal them up, and lay them in the
uſual Place, if you find it not ſuſpected, I will
watch an Opportunity to convey them; but if
they are large, you had beſt be very cautious.
This evil Woman, I find, miſtruſts me much.
" I juſt hear that the Gentleman is dying, whoſe
Living Mr. B. has promis'd me. I have almoſt
a Scruple of taking it, as I am acting ſo contrary
to his Deſires ; but I hope he’ll one Day thank
me for it. As to Money, don’t think of it at

Power to do for you, without Reſerve. . . . ."
“I believe, when we hear he is coming, it will be
beſt to make uſe of the Key, which I ſhall ſoon
procure you; and I can borrow a Horſe for you, I
believe, to wait within half a Mile of the Back-
door, over the Paſture; and will contrive by my-

to thank him moſtgratefully for his kind Endeavours;
to lament the little Concern the Gentry had for my
deplorable Cafe; the Wickedneſs of the World, firſt .
to give way to ſuch iniquitous Faſhions, and then
plead the Frequency of them, againſt the Attempt to
amend them; and how .#. People were to
the Diſtreſſes of others. I recall'd my former Hint
as to writing to Lady Davers, which f fear'd, I ſaid,
would only ſerve to apprize her Brother, that ſhe
knew his wicked Scheme, and more harden him in
it, and make him come down the ſooner, and to be
the more determin’d on my Ruin; beſides, that it
might make Mr. Williams gueſs'd at, as a means of
conveying my Letter: And being very fearful, that
if that good Lady would intereſt herſelf in my Be-
half, (which was a Doubt, becauſe ſhe both lov’d
and fear'd her Brother) it would have no Effect upon
bim ; and that, therefore, I would wait the happy
Event I might hope for from his kind Aſſiſtance in
the Key and the Horſe. I intimated my Maſter's
Letter, begging to be permitted to come down: Was
fearful it might be ſudden ; and that I was of Opi-
nion no Time was to be loſt; for we might loſe all
our Opportunities; telling him the Money-trick
of this vile Woman, &c.
I had not Time to take a Copy of this Letter, I
was ſo watch'd. But when I had it ready in my Bo-
ſom, I was eaſy.' And ſo I went to ſeek out Mrs.
jewkes, and told her I would have her Advice upon
the Letter I had receiv'd from my Maſter, which
Point of Confidence in her, pleaſed her not a little.
Ay, ſaid ſhe, now this is ſomething like: And,
we'll take a furnin the Garden, or where you pleaſe.
I pretended it was indifferent to me; and ſo we
walk’d into the Garden. I began to talk to her of the
Letter; but was far from acquainting her with all the
Contents; only that he wanted my Conſent to come
I 5 down,

<page 221>
178 P A. M. E. L. A ; Or,

down, and hop’d ſhe us'd me kindly, and the like.
And I ſaid, Now, Mrs. Jewkes, Jet me have your
Advice as to this. Why then, ſaid ſhe, I will give
it you freely. E'en ſend to him to come down. It
will highly oblige him, and I dare ſay you’ll fare the
better for it. How the better? ſaid I---I dare ſay:
ou think yourſelf, that he intends my Ruin. I
hate, ſaid ſhe, that fooliſh Word; your Ruin ſ-
Why ne'er a Lady in the Lady may live happier than
you, if you will, or be more honourably uſed.
Well, Mrs. Jewkes, ſaid I, I ſhall not at this time
diſpute with you about the Words Ruin or honour-
able ; for I find, we have quite different Notions
of both : But now I will ſpeak plainer than ever I
did. Do you think he intends to make Propoſals to
me, as to a kept Miſtreſs, or kept Slave rather, or
do you not?---Why, Lambkin, ſaid ſhe, what doſt
thou think thyſelf?---I fear, ſaid I, he does. Well,
ſaid ſhe, but if he does, (for I know nothing of the
Matter, I aſſure you) you may have your own
Terms---I ſee that; for you may do anything with
him.
I could not bear this to be ſpoken, tho' it was all I
fear'd of a long time;. and began to exclaim moſt
ſadly. Nay, ſaid ſhe, he may marry you, as far as I
know.---No, no, ſaid I, that cannot be---I neither
deſire nor expect it. His Condition don’t permit me
to have ſuch a Thought, and that, and the whole
Series of his Condućt, convinces me of the con-
trary 3, and you would have me invite him to
come down, would you ? Is not this to invite my
Ruin
'Tis what I would do, ſaid ſhe, in your Place;
and if it was to be as you think, I ſhould rather be
out of my Pain, than live in continual Frights and
Apprehenſions, as you do. No, reply'd I, an Hour of
Innocence is worth an Age of Guilt; and were my

Who knows what Providence may do for me !
ou may prevail upon him by your Prayers and

bettery let him come down... Well, ſaid I, I will
write him a Letter, becauſe he expeds an Anſwer,
or may-be he will make that a Pretence to come
down. How can it go?
, I'll take care of that, ſaid ſhe ; it is in my In-
ſtructions—Ay, thought I, ſo I doubt, by the
Hint Mr. Williams gave me, about the Poſt-houſe. 4
The Gardener coming by, I ſaid, Mr. Jacob, I
have planted a few Beans, and I call the Place my
Garden. It is juſt by the Door out-yonder, I’ll ſhew
it you; pray don’t dig them up. So I went on with
him ; and when we had turn’d the Alley, out of her
Sight, and were near the Place, ſaid I, Pray ſtep to
Mrs. Jewkes, and aſk her if ſhe has any more Beans
for me to plant? He ſmil'd, I ſuppoſe at my Fooliſh-
neſs, and I popt the Letter under the Mould, and
ſtept back, as if waiting for his Return; which being
near, was immediate, and ſhe follow’d him. What
ſhould I do with Beans? ſaid ſhe---and ſadly ſcar'd
me; for ſhe whiſper'd me, I am afraid of ſome Fetch!
&; don’t uſe to ſend of ſuch ſimple Errands.-
hat Fetch?, ſaid I ; it is hard I can neither ſtir,
nor ſpeak, but I muſt be ſuſpe&ted.—Why, ſaid
ſhe, my Maſter writes, that I muſt have all my
:Eyes about me; for, tho’ you are as innocent as a
Dove, yet you’re as cunning as a Serpent. But I'll
forgive you, if you cheat me. -
Then I thought of my Money, and could have

Mrs. Jewkes, now you talk of forgiving me, if I
cheat you, be ſo kind as to pay me my Money;

you was but in Jeſt, and intended to give it me
again. You ſhall have it in a propertime, ſaid ſhe 3.
but, indeed, I was in earneſt to get it out of your
Hands, for fear you ſhould make an ill Uſe of it.
And ſo we cavilled upon this Subječt as we walk’d
in, and I went up to write my Letter to my Maſter;
and, as I intended to ſhew it her, I reſolv'd to
write accordingly as to her Part of it ; ; for I made
little Account of his Offer of Mrs. Jervis to me,
inſtead of this wicked Woman, (tho’ the moſt agree-
able thing that could have befallen me, except my
Eſcape from hence) nor indeed of any thing he
ſaid: For to be honourable, in the juſt Senſe of the
Word, he need not have caus'd me to be run away
with, and confin’d as I am. I wrote as follows:
* Honoured Sir, -

upon my being in that ſtrange manner run away

you think, Sir, (pardon your poor Servant's Free-
dom. ; my Fears make me bold; do you think,
I ſay) that your general Aſſurances of Honour to
me, can have the Effeót upon me, that, were it not
for theſe Things, all your Words ought to have?

I wiſh you would tell me if you have taken my Ad-

If it will oblige you, ſaid I, I will read it to you.
That’s good, ſaid ſhe ; then I’ll love you dearly.--
Said I, then you muſt not offer to alter oneWord.
I won’t, reply'd ſhe. So I read it to her, and ſhe prais'd
me much for my Wording it; but ſaid, ſhe thought
I puſh’d the Matter very cloſe ; and it would better
bear talking of, than writing about. She wanted an
Explanation or two, as about the Propoſal to a cer-
tain Perſon; but I ſaid, ſhe muſt take it as ſhe heard
it. Well, well, ſaid ſhe, I make no doubt you un-

I Write now with a little more Liking, tho’ leſs

Parcel of my Papers ſafe, in his Hands, to ſend
them to you, as he has Opportunity ; ſo I am not
quite uſeleſly employ'd ; and I am deliver'd, beſides,
from the Fear of their being found, if I ſhould be

half a Mile, and then is a Common, and near that:
a private Horſe-road, where I hope to find an Op-:

— My hard Caſe makes me ſerious. He found
means to ſlide a Letter into my Hands, and is gone
away: He look’d at me with ſuch Reſpect and
Solemnneſs at Parting, that Mrs.jewkes ſaid, Why,
Madam, I believe our young Parſon is half in Love
with you.---Ah! Mrs. Jewkes, ſaid I, he knows
better. Said ſhe, (I believe to ſound me) Why I
can’t ſee you can either of you do better; and I
have lately been ſo touch'd for you, ſeeing how
heavily you apprehend Diſhonour from my Maſter,
that Y think it is Pity you ſhould not have Mr.
Williams. > - - -
I knew this muſt be a Fetch of hers, becauſe in-
ſtead of being troubled for me, as ſhe pretended,
fhe watched me cloſer, and him too; and ſo I ſaid,
There is not the Man living that I deſire to marry.
If I can but keep myſelf honeſt, it is all my Deſire:
And to be a Comfort and Aſſiſtance to my poor Pa-
rents, if it ſhould be my happy Lot to be ſo, is the
very Top of my Ambition. ell, but, ſaid ſhe, I
have been thinking very ſeriouſly, that Mr. Williams
would make you a good Huſband; and as he will owe
all his Fortune to my Maſter, he will be very glad,
to be ſure, to be oblig'd to him for a Wife of his
chuſing: Eſpecially, ſaid ſhe, ſuch a pretty one,
and one ſo ingenious and genteelly educated. -
. This gave me a Doubt, whether ſhe knew of
my Maſter's Intimation of that ſort formerly; and
I aſked her, if ſhe had Reaſon to ſurmiſe, that that
was in View No, ſhe ſaid; it was only her own
Thought ; but it was very likely that my Maſter had
either that in View, or ſomething better for me.
But, if I approv’d of it, ſhe would propoſe ſuch a
thing to her Maſter directly; and gave a deteſtable
ºint, that I might take Reſolutions upon it, of
tº -º bring-

bringing ſuch an Affair to Effect. I told her, I ab-

I thought him a civil good ſort of Man ; but as on
... one ſide, he was above me; ſo on the other, of
all Things, I did not love a Parſon. So finding
ſhe could make nothing of me, ſhe quitted the
. Subjećt.
. . I will open his Letter by-and-by, and give you
the Contents of it; for ſhe is up and down ſo
much, that I am afraid of her ſurpriſing me.
Well, I ſee Providence has not abandon'd me: I
ſhall be under no Neceſſity to make Advances to
Mr. Williams, if I was (as I am ſure I am not)
diſpos'd to it. This is his Letter :
º I Know not how to expreſs myſelf, leſt I ſhould

one effectual and honourable Way to diſengage

t is that of Marriage with ſome Perſon that you
could make happy in your Approbation. As for
my own part, it would be, as Things ſtand, m
apparent Ruin; and, worſe ſtill, I ſhould involve
you in Miſery too. . But yet, ſo great is my Vene-
ration for you, and ſo intire my Reliance in Pro-

myſelf but too happy, if I might be accepted. I

and be your Condućtor to ſome ſafe Diſtance.
But why do I ſay, in this Caſe? That I will do,
whether you think fit to reward me ſo eminently

to be Almost (I took Notice of that Word) at an
End ſhe came up to us again; and ſaid, Well, I had
a good mind to ſhew you the way to Church to-

preſent doubtful Situation, I ſhould not have choſen
it, yet I would have encourag’d her Propoſal, to be
able to judge by her being in Earneſt or otherwiſe,
whether one might depend upon the reſt. But Mr.
Williams again indiſcreetly help'd her to an Excuſe;
by ſaying, that it was now beſt to defer it one Sunday,
and till Matters were riper for my Appearance ; and
ſhe readily took holdofit, and confirm'd his Opinion.
After all, I hope the beſt ; but if this ſhould turn
out to be a Plot, I fear nothing but a Miracle can
ſave me. But ſure, the Heart of Man is not capable
of ſuch black Deceit. Beſides, Mr. Williams has it
under his own Hand, and he dare not but be in Ear-
neſt; and then again, tho’ to be ſure he has been
very wrong to me, yet his Education, and Parents

I was forc'd to be very reſerved to him ; for the
poor Gentleman has no Guard, no Caution at all.

her, as I could do very ſafely, that there was not a
Man on Earth I wiſh'd to have; and, as to Mr.
Williams, he might do better by far, and I had pro-
poſed ſo much Happineſs in living with my poor
Father and Mother, that I could not think of any
Scheme of Life, with Pleaſure, till I had try’d that.
I ask'd her for my Money; and ſhe ſaid it was
above in her ſtrong Box, but that I ſhall have it
to-morrow. All theſe Things look well, as I
fuid.
Mr. Williams would go home this Night, tho’
late, becauſe he would diſpatch a Meſſenger to you
with a Letter he had propos'd from himſelf, and
my Pacquet. But pray don’t encourage him, as
I ſaid; for he is much too heady and precipitate
as to this Matter, in my way of thinking; tho’,
to be ſure, he is a very good Man, and I am much
oblig'd to him.
M O N D A r Morning,
AL...lay! we have bad News from poor Mr.
Williams. He has had a ſad Miſchance; fallen
among Rogues in his Way home laſt Night; but
by good Chance has ſav'd my Papers. This is the
Account he gives of it to Mrs. Jewkes.
* Gºod Mrs. J E w K E s,
º I Have had a ſore Misfortune in going from you.
* * When I had got as near the Town as the Dam,
* and was goingtocroſs the Wooden-bridge, two Fel-
“lows got hold of me, and ſwore bitterly they would
* kill me, if I did not give them what I had. They
* romag'd my Pockets, and took from me my Snuff-
* Box, my Seal-ring, and Half a Guinea, and ſome
‘Silver, and Half-pence; alſo my Handkerchief,

* Shins and Knees were bruis’d much in the Fall
* againſt one of the Stumps; and I had like to have
* been ſuffocated in Water and Mudd. To be ſure,
* I ſhan’t be able to ſtir out this Day or two. For
* I am a fearful Spectacle ! My Hat and Wig I
* was forc’d to leave behind me, and go home a
“Mile and a half without ; but they were found
* next Morning, and brought me, with my Snuff-
‘box, which the Rogues muſt have dropt. My
‘Caſſock is ſadly torn, as is my Band. To be

The wicked Brute fell a laughing when ſhe had
read this Letter, till her fat Sides ſhook; ſaid ſhe, I
can but think how the poor Parſon look’d, after
parting with his pretty Miſtreſs in ſuch high Spirits,

to laugh at ſuch a Misfortune: But ſhe ſaid, As he
was ſafe, ſhe laughed; otherwiſe ſhe ſhould have
been ſorry: And ſhe was glad to ſee me ſo concern'd
for him—It look’d jº, ſhe ſaid. - * ,--
I heeded not her Refle&tion; but as I have been
uſed to Cauſes for Miſtruſts, I cannot help ſaying,
that I don't like this thing: And their taking his
Letters moſt alarms me.—How happy it was, they
miſs'd my Pacquet ! I know not what to think of

Peace? But yet it will do ſo while I ſtay here. ,
Mrs. Jewkes is mightily at me, to go with her in

cunning, artful Woman, I know not what to make

could not ſee I was watch'd; ſo this looks well. But
if any thing ſhould go bad afterwards, I ſhould never
forgive myſelf, for not taking this Qpportunity:
Well, I will go down again, and ſee if all is clear, and
how it looks out at the Back-door in the Paſture.
- To be ſure, there is Witchcraft in this Houſe;

a Bow-ſhoot into the Paſture; but there ſtood
that horrid Bull, ſtaring me full in the Face, with
fiery ſaucer Eyes, as I thought. So, I got in again;
for fear he ſhould come at me. Nóbody ſaw me,
however.--Do you think there are ſuch things as

But after all, if my Maſter ſhould mean well, he
can’t be angry at my Fears, if I ſhould eſcape; and
no body can blame me; and I can more eaſily be
induced with you, when all my Apprehenſions are
over, to conſider his Propoſal of Mr. Williams, than
I could here; and he pretends as you have read in
his Letter, he will leave me at my Choice: Why
then ſhould I be afraid? I will go down again, I
think! But yet my Heart miſgives me, becauſe of
the Difficulties before me, in eſcaping; and being
ſo poor and ſo friendleſs! – O good God! the Pre-

Well, I have juſt now a fort of ſtrange Per-

Alack-a-day! what a Fate is this! I have not the

again, as I was before, out of the Back door; and
I looked, and ſaw the Bull, as I thought, between
me and the Door; and another Bull coming towards
me the other way: Well, thought I, here is double

Maſter in one Bull; and Mrs.jewkes's in the other:
and now I am gone, to be ſure! O help ! cry’d I,
like a Fool, and run back to the Door, as ſwift as
if I flew. When I had got the Door in my Hand,
I ventur'd to look back, to ſee if theſe ſuppoſed
Bulls were coming; and I ſaw they were only two
poor Cows, a grazing in diſtant Places, that my
Fears had made all this Rout about. But as eve-
ry thing is ſo frightful to me, I find I am not fit
to think of my Eſcape: For I ſhall be as much
frighted at the firſt ſtrange Man that I meet with.
And I am perſuaded, that Fear brings one into more
Dangers, than the Caution, that goes along with it,
delivers one from.
I then locked the Door, and put the Key in my
Pocket, and was in a ſad Quandary; but I was ſoon
determined; for the Maid Nan came in Sight, and
asked, if any thing was the matter, that I was ſo
often up and down Stairs? God forgive me; but I
had a ſad Lye at my Tongue’s End: ſaid I, Tho’
, Mrs. Jewkes is ſometimes a little hard upon me, yet
I know not where I am without her: I go up, and
I come down to walk about in the Garden: and
not having her, know ſcarcely what to do with my-
ſelf. Ay, ſaid the Idiot, ſhe is main good Com-
pany, Madam; no wonder you miſs her.
So here I am again; and here likely to be; for I
have no Courage to help myſelf any-where elſe... O
why are poor fooliſh Maidens try’d with ſuch Dan-
gers, when they have ſuch weak Minds to grapple
with them!—I will, ſince it is ſo, hope the beſt:
But yet I cannot but obſerve how grievouſly every
ºthing makes againſt me: For here are the Robbers;
tho' I fell not into their Hands myſelf, yet they
gave me as much Terror: and had as great an Ef-
feót upon my Fears, as if I had: And here is, the

S9, Mrs.jewkes is returned from her Viſit: Well,
ſaid ſhe, I would have you ſet your Heart at reſt;
for Mr. Williams will do very well again. He is not
half ſo badly off as he fancy’d. Otheſe Scholars,
ſaid ſhe, they have not the Hearts of Mice! He has
only a few Scratches on his Face; which, ſaid ſhe,
I ſuppoſe he got by grabbling among the Gravel,
at the bottom of the Dam, to try to find a Hole
in the Ground, to hide himſelf from the Robbers.
His Shin and his Knee are hardly to be ſeen to ail
any thing. He ſays in his Letter, he was a fright-
ful Spe&tacle: He might be ſo indeed, when he firſt
came in a-doors ; but he looks well enough now ;
and, only for a few Groans now-and-then, when he
thinks of his Danger, I ſee nothing is the matter
with him. So, Mrs. Pamela, ſaid ſhe, I would have
you be very eaſy about it. I am glad of it, ſaid I,
for all your Jokes, Mrs.jewkes.
Well, ſaid ſhe, he talks of nothing but you; and
when I told him, I would fain have perſuaded you
to come with me, the Man was out of his Wits.

his Heart to me, and told me all that has paſſed,

poſed, we had no Opportunity for it, from your

I was ſo troubled at what might have paſſed be-
tween Mr. Williams and her, that I could not hide
it. And ſhe ſaid, Well, Mrs. Pamela, ſince all Mat-
ters are likely to be ſo ſoon and ſo happily ended,
let me adviſe you to be a little leſs concern’d at his
Diſcoveries: and make me your Confident, as he has
done, and I ſhall think you have ſome Favour for

not repent it. -

for her Kindneſs to Mr. Williams in her Viſit to
him ; which was only to get out of him what ſhe
could. Why, Mrs. Jewkes, ſaid I, is all this fiſhing
about for ſomething, where there is nothing, if there
be an end of your Watchments, as you call them?
Nothing, ſaid ſhe, but Womaniſh Curioſity, I'll
aſſure you ; for one is naturally led to find out Mat-
ters, where there is ſuch Privacy intended. Well,
ſaid I, pray let me know what he has ſaid; and then
I’ll give you an Anſwer to your Curioſity. I don’t

I will cloſe this Day’s writing, with juſt ſaying,
that ſhe is mighty ſilent and reſerved, to what ſhe
was, and ſays nothing but No, or Yes, to what I
ask. Something muſt be hatching, I doubt 1– I
the rather think ſo, becauſe I find ſhe does not keep
her word with me, about lying by myſelf, and my
Money; to both which Points, ſhe returned ſuſpi-
cious Anſwers, ſaying, as to the one, Why you are
mighty earneſt for your Money: I ſhan’t run away
with it: And to the other, Good lack! you need not
be ſo willing, as I know of, to part with me for a
Bedfellow, till you are ſure of one you like better.

MR: Williams has been here; but we have had
no Opportunity to talk together: He ſeem’d
confounded at Mrs.jewkes's Change of Temper, and
Refervedneſs, after her kind Viſit, and their Free-
dom with one another, and much more at what I
am going to tell you. He asked, if I would take a
Turn in the Garden with Mrs. Jewkes and him.
No, ſaid ſhe, I can’t go. Said he, may not Mrs.
Pamela take a Walk?–No, ſaid ſhe; I deſire ſhe
won’t. Why, Mrs. fewkes, ſaid he? I am afraid I
have ſome-how diſobliged you. Not at all, reply'd
ſhe ; but I ſuppoſe you will ſoon be at Liberty to walk
together as much as you pleaſe: And F have ſent
a Meſſenger for my laſt Inſtructions, about this and
more weighty Matters; and when they come, I
ſhall leave you to do as you both will; but till then,
it is no matter how little you are together. This
alarm'd us both; and he ſeem’d quite ſtruck of a

Countenance. So I went behind her Back, and
beld my two Hands together, flat, with a Bit of Pa-
per, I had, between them, and looked at him; and
he ſeemed to take me, as I intended, intimating the
renewing of the Correſpondence by the Tiles.
So I left them both together, and retired to my
Cloſet, to write a Letter for the Tiles; but having
no Time for a Copy, I will give you the Subſtance

“hope, after all, this is only a Touch of this ill

* But he ſays, Lady Davers is at their Houſe, and
is to accompany her Brother to London, or meet
him there, he knows not which. He profeſſes
great Zeal and Affe&tion to your Service. But I
find he refers to a Letter he ſent me before, but
which is not come to my Hand. I think there
can be no Treachery; for it is a particular Friend
at Gainſborough, that I have order'd him to are&t
to ; and this is come ſafe to my Hands by this
means; for well I know, I durſt truſt nothing to
Brett, at the Poſt-houſe here. This gives me a
little Pain; but I hope all will end well, and we
ſhall ſoon hear, if it be neceſſary to purſue our
former Intentions. If it be, I will loſe no time
to provide a Horſe for you, and another for my-
ſelf; for I can never do either God or myſelf

Concern to make me happy with you. I hint-

Mr. Williams was a little nettled at my Impatience;
and ſo I wrote to aſſure him I would be as eaſy as
Icould, and wholly direéted by him; eſpecially as my
Father, whoſe Reſpects I mentioned, had aſſured me,
my Maſter was ſetting out for London, which he
muſt have ſome-how from his own Family, or he
would not have written me word of it.
S A TU R D A 1: S UN D A 1:
MR. Williams has been here both theſe Days, as
uſual; but is very indifferently received ſtill
by Mrs. Jewkes; and to avoid Suſpicion, I left
them together, and went up to my Cloſet, moſt of
the Time he was here. He and ſhe, I found by
her, had a Quarrel; and ſhe ſeems quite out of Hu-
mour with him; but I thought it beſt not to ſay
anything. And he ſaid, he would very little trouble
the Houſe, till he had an Anſwer to his Letter from
Mr. B. And ſhe return'd, The leſs, the better.
Poor Man! he has got but little by his Openneſs,
and making Mrs.jewkes his Confident, as ſhe brag-
ged, and would have had me to do likewiſe.
I am more and more ſatisfied there is Miſchief
brewing, and ſhall begin to hide my Papers, and be
circumſpect. She ſeems mighty impatient for an
Anſwer to her Letter to my Maſter.

A Meſſenger is return'd, and now allis out! O
wretched, wretched Pamela / What, at laſt, will be-
come of me! — Such ſtrange Turns and Trials ſure
never poor Creature of my Years, experienced. He
brought two Letters, one to Mrs. Jewkes; and one
to me: But, as the greateſt Wits may be ſometimes
miſtaken, they being folded and ſealed alike, that
for me, was direéted to Mrs. |..". ; and that
for her, was direéted to me. But both are ſtark
naught, abominably bad!' She brought me up that
direéted for me, and ſaid, Here's a Letter for you:
Long look’d-for is come at laſt. I will ask the
Meſſenger a few Queſtions, and then I will read
mine. So ſhe went down, and I broke it open in
my Cloſet, and found it direéted, To Mrs. PAME LA
AND REws. But when I open'd it, it began, Mrs.
jewkes. I was quite confounded; but, thinks I,
this may be a lucky Miſtake; I may diſcover ſome-
thing. And ſo I read on theſe horrid Contents:
*** Mrs. Jew k es, - • * * ~ *

can truſt; and ſo let him be your Aſſiſtant: For
the artful Creature is enough to corrupt a Nation
by her ſeeming Innocence and Simplicity; and
ſhe may have got a Party, perhaps, among my
Servants with you, as ſhe has here. Even john
Arnold, whom I confided in, and favour’d more
than any, has proved an execrable Villain ; and
ſhall meet his Reward for it. -
“As to that College Novice Williams, Ineed not bid
you take care he ſees not this painted Bauble; for I
have order'd Mr. Shorter, my Attorney, to throw
hiin inſtantly into Goal, on an Aćtion of Debt, for
Money he has had of me, which I had intended
never to carry to account againſt him; for I know
all his raſcally Pračtices; beſides what you write
me of his perfidious Intrigue with that Girl, and
his acknowledged Contrivances for her Eſcape ;
when he knew not, for certain, that I deſign'd her
any Miſchief; and when, if he had been guided
by a Senſe of Piety, or Compaſſion for injured In-
nocence, as he pretends, he would have expoſtu-
lated with me, as his Funètion, and my Friendſhip
for him, might have allow’d him. But to enter
into a vile Intrigue, charm’d, like a godly Senſua-
liſt, with the amiable Gewgaw, to favour her Eſ-
cape in ſo baſe a manner, (to ſay nothing of his
diſgraceful Pračtices againſt me, in Sir Simon Darn-
ford's Family; of which Sir Simon himſelf has in-
form'd me) is a Condućt that, inſtead of prefer-
ring the ingrateful Wretch, as I had intended,
ſhall pull down upon him utter Ruin.
* Monſieur Colbrand, my truſty Swiſs, will obey
ou without Reſerve, if my other Servants refuſe.
“As for her denying that ſhe encouraged his De-
claration, I believe it not. 'Tis certain the ſpeak-
ing Pićture, with all that pretended Innocence,
and Baſhfulneſs, would have run away with

him. Yes, ſhe would have run away witha Fellow
that ſhe had been acquainted with (and that not
intimately, if you was as careful as you ought
to be) but few Days ; at a time, when ſhe had the
ſtrongeſt Aſſurances of my Honour to her.
* Well, I think I now hate her perfeótly; and
tho' I will do nothing to her myſelf, yet I can
bear, for the ſake of my Revenge, and my injur’d
Honour, and ſlighted Love, to ſee any thing, even
what ſhe moſt fears, be done to her ; and then ſhe
may be turned looſe to her evil Deſtiny, and
echo to the Woods and Groves her piteous La-
mentations for the Loſs of her fantaſtical Inno-
cence, which the romantic Idiot makes ſuch a
work about. I ſhall go to London, with mySiſter
Davers; and the Moment I can diſengage myſelf,
which perhaps may be in three Weeks from this
time, I will be with you, and decide her Fate,
and put an End to your Trouble. Mean time, be
doubly careful; for this Innocent, as I have warn’d
you, is full of Contrivances, I am -

I had but juſt read this dreadfulLetter thro’, when
Mrs. Jewkes came up, in a great Fright, gueſfing at
the Miſtake, and that I had her Letter; and ſhe
found me with it open in my Hand, juſt ſinking
away. What Buſineſs, ſaid ſhe, had you to read my
Letter? and ſnatch'd it from me. You ſee, ſaid ſhe, a
looking upon it, it ſays, Mrs.jewkes, at top: You
ought in Manners, to have read no further. O
add not, ſaid I, to my Afflićtions! I ſhall be ſoon
out of all your ways! This is too much! too much!
I never can ſupport this!—and threw myſelf upon
the Couch, in my Cloſet, and wept moſt bitterly.
She read it in the next Room, and came in .
after-

<page 259>
216 P A M E L A ; Or,
aſterwards; Why this, ſaid ſhe, is a ſad Letter in-
deed! I am ſorry for it: But I fear'd you would carry
your Niceties too far!—Leave me, leave me, Mrs.
jewkes, ſaid I, for a-while: I cannot ſpeak nor talk!
—Poor Heart! ſaid ſhe; well, I’ll come up again
preſently, and hope to find you better. But here,
take your own Letter; I wiſh you well, but this is
a ſad Miſtake 1 And ſo ſhe put down by me, that
which was intended for me. But I have no Spirit to
read it at preſent. O Man!Man! hard-hearted, cruel
Man! what Miſchiefs art thou not capable of, un-
relenting Perſecutor as thou art!
I ſat ruminating, when I had a little come to my-
ſelf, upon the Terms of this wicked Letter; and
had no Inclination to look into my own. The bad
Names, Fool’s Plaything, artful Creature, painted
Bauble, Gewgaw, ſpeaking Pićture, are hard Words
for your poor Pamela; and I began to think, whether
I was not indeed a very naughty Body, and had not
done vile Things: But when I thought of his having
diſcover'd poor john, and of Sir Simon's baſe Offi-
ciouſneſs, in telling him of Mr. Williams, with
what he had reſolved againſt him, in Revenge for
his Goodneſs to me, I was quite diſpirited; and
yet ſtillmore, about that fearful Colebrand, and what
he could ſee done to me; for then I was ready to
gaſp for Breath, and my Heart quite failed me.
Then how dreadful are the Words, that he will de-
cide my Fate in three Weeks! Gracious Heaven,
ſaid I, ſtrike me dead before that time, with a
Thunderbolt, or provide ſome way for my eſcaping
theſe threaten’d Miſchiefs! God forgive me if I
finned. -
At laſt, I took up the Letter direéted for Mrs.
jewkes, but deſigned for me; and I find that little
better than the other. Theſe are the hard Terms
it contains:

WELL have you done, perverſe, forward,
- artful, yet fooliſh Pamela, to convince
me, before it was too late, how ill. I had done
to place my Affections on ſo unworthy an Ob-
ject. I had vow’d Honour and Love to your
Unworthineſs, believing you a Mirror of baſhful
Modeſty, and unſpotted Innocence; and that no
perfidious Deſigns lurked in ſo fair a Boſom. But
now I have found you out, you ſpecious Hypo- .
crite! and I ſee, that tho’ you could not repoſe
the leaſt Confidence in one you had known for
*Years, and who, under my good Mother’s miſ-
placed Favour for you, had grown up, in a man-
ner, with you ; when my Paſſion, in ſpite of my
Pride, and the Difference of our Condition, made
me ſtoop to a Meanneſs that now I deſpiſe my-
ſelf for ; yet you could enter into an Intrigue
with a Man you never knew, till within theſe few
Days paſt, and reſolve to run away with a Stranger,
whom your fair Face, and inſinuating Arts, had
bewitched to break thro' all the Ties of Honour
and Gratitude to me, even at a Time when the
Happineſs of his future Life depended upon my
Favour.
: ‘Henceforth, for Pamela's ſake, whenever I ſee
a lovely Face, will I miſtruſt a deceitful Heart:
And whenever I hear of the greateſt Pretences to
Innocence, will I ſuſpect ſome deep. laid Miſchief.
You were determin'd to place no Confidence in
me, tho’ I have ſolemnly, over and over, engaged
my Honour to you. What, tho’ I had alarm'd
your Fears, in ſending you one way, when you
hoped to go another; yet, had I not, to convince
you of my Reſolution to do juſtly by you, (altho’
with great Reluctance, ſuch then was my Love
‘ for you) engaged not to come near you without

* Mrs. Žewkes has Direétions concerning you;
“And if your Lot is now harder thanyou might
“wiſh, you will bear it the eaſier, becauſe your
“own raſh Folly has brought it upon you.
Alas! for me, what a Fate is mine, to be thus
thought artful and forward, and ingrateful when
all I intended, was to preſerve my Innocence; and
when all the poor little Shifts, which his ſuperior
wicked Wit and Cunning have render'd ineffectual,
were forced upon me in my own neceſſary De-
fence!
When Mrs.jewkes cameuptomeagain, ſhefound
me bathed in Tears. She ſeemed, as I thought, to
be moved to ſome Compaſſion ; and finding my-
ſelf now intirely in her Power, and that it is not for
me to provoke her, I ſaid, It is now, I ſee, in vain
for me to contend againſt my evil Deſtiny, and the
ſuperior Arts of my barbarous Maſter. I will reſign
myſelf to the Divine Will, and prepare to expe&t the
worſt. But you ſee how this poor Mr. Williams

is drawn in and undone; I am ſorry I am made
the Cauſe of his Ruin:—Poor, poor Man!—to
be taken in thus, and for my Sake too!—But, if
you’ll believe me, ſaid I, I gave no Encouragement
to what he propoſed, as to Marriage; nor would he
have propoſed it, I believe, but as the only honour-
able way he thought was left to ſave me: And
his principal Motive to it all, was Virtue and Com-
paſſion to one in Diſtreſs. What other View could
he have? You know I am poor and friendleſs. All I
beg of you, is to let the poor Gentleman have No-
tice of my Maſter's Reſentment; and let him flee
the Country, and not be thrown into Goal: This
will anſwer my Maſter's End as well; for it will as
effectually hinder him from affiſting me, as if he was
in a Priſon.
Aſk me, ſaid ſhe, to do anything that is in my
Power, conſiſtent with my Duty and Truſt, and I
will do it; for I am ſorry for you both. But, to
be ſure, I ſhall keep no Correſpondence with him,
nor let you. I offer'd to talk of a Duty ſuperior to
that ſhe mention'd, of, which would obligeher to help
diſtreſſed Innocence, and not permit her to go the
Lengths injoin’d by lawleſs Tyranny; but ſheplainly
bid me be ſilent on that Head; for it was in vain
to attempt to perſuade her to betray her Truſt.—
All I have to adviſe you, ſaid ſhe, is to be eaſy;
lay aſide all your Contrivances and Arts to get away,
and make me your Friend, by giving me no Reaſon
to ſuſpect you; for, ſaid ſhe, I glory in my Fidelity
to my Maſter: And you have both pračtiſed ſome
ſtrange ſly Arts, to make ſuch a Progreſs as he has
own'd there was between you, ſo ſeldomas, I thought,
you ſaw one another; and I muſt be more circum-
ſpect than I have been.
This doubled my Concern; for I now apprehend-
ed I ſhould be much cloſer watch'd than before.
- L 2 Well,

<page 263>
220 P. A. M. E. L.A.; Or,
Well, ſaid I, ſince I have, by this ſtrange Acci-
dent, diſcover'd my hard Deſtiny, let me read over
again that fearful Letter of yours, that I may get it
by heart, and feed my Diſtreſs upon it; for now I
have nothing elſe to think of, and muſt familiarize
myſelf to Calamity. Then, ſaid ſhe, let me read
yours again. I gave her mine, and ſhe lent me hers;
and ſo I took a Copy of it, with her Leave ; be-
cauſe, as I ſaid, I would, by it, prepare myſelf for
the worſt. And when i had done, I pinn’d it on
the Head of the Couch: This, ſaid I, is the Uſe I
ſhall make of this wretched Copy of your Letter;
and here you ſhall always find it wet with my Tears.
She ſaid, She would go down to order Supper,
and inſiſted upon my Company to it: I would have
excuſed myſelf; but ſhe begun to put on a com-
manding Air, that I durſt not oppoſe. And when
I went down, ſhe took me by the Hand, and pre:
fented me to the moſt hideous Monſter I ever ſaw
in my Life. Here, Monſieur Colbrand, ſaid ſhe, here
is your pretty Ward and mine ; let us try to make
her Time with us eaſy. He bow’d, and put on
his foreign Grimaces, and ſeem'd to bleſs himſelf!
and, in broken Engliſh, told me, I was happy in de
Afféétions of de vineſt Gentleman in de W. !—
I was quite frighten’d, and ready to drop down ;
and I will deſcribe him to you, my dear Father and
Mother, if now you will ever ſee this; and you ſhall
judge if I had not Reaſon, eſpecially not knowing
he was to be there, and being appriz'd, as I was,
of his hated Employment, to watch me cloſer.
He is a Giant of a Man, for Stature; taller by a
good deal, than Harry Mawlidge, in your Neigh-
bourhood, and large-bon'd, and ſcraggy ; and has a
Hand!—I never ſaw ſuch an one in my Life. He
has great ſtaring Eyes, like the Bull's that frighten’d
me ſo. Vaſt Jaw-bones ſticking out; Eyebrows
- hanging

<page 264>
V_1 R T U E Rewarded. 221
hanging over his Eyes; two great Scars upon his
Forehead, and one on his left Cheek; and two huge
Whiſkers, and a monſtrous wide Mouth ; blubber
Lips; long yellow Teeth, and a hideous Grin. He
wears his own frightful long Hair, ty’d up in a great
black Bag; a black Crape Neckloth, about a long
ugly Neck; and his Throat ſticking out like a Wen.
As to the reſt, he was dreſt well enough, and had a
Sword on, with a naſty red Knot to it; Leather
Garters, buckled below his Knees; and a Foot–
near as long as my Arm, I verily think.
... He ſaid, he fright de Lady, and offer'd to with-
draw; but ſhe bid him not; and I told Mrs.jewkes,
That as ſhe knew I had been crying, ſhe ſhould
not have called me to the Gentleman without letting
me know he was there. I ſoon went up to my
Cloſet; for my Heart aked all the time I was at
Table; not being able to look upon him without
Horror; and this Brute of a Woman, tho’ ſhe ſaw
my Diſtreſs, before this Addition to it, no doubt
did it on purpoſe to ſtrike me myle into Terror.
And indeed it had its Effect; for when I went to-
bed, I could think of nothing but his hideous Per-
ſon, and my Maſter's more hideous Aëtions; and
thought them too well pair’d ; and when I dropt
aſleep, I dream'd they were both coming to my
Bed-ſide, with the worſt Deſigns; and I jump'd cut
of Bed in my Sleep, and frighted Mrs. Jewkes; till,
waking with the Terror, I told her my Dream:
And the wicked Creature only laughed, and ſaid,
All I fear'd was but a Dream, as well as that; and
when it was over, and I was well awake, I ſhould
laugh at it as ſuch! . -

<page 265>
22.2 P A M E 14, Or,
And now I am come to the Cloſe of W E D NES-
DAY, the 27th Day of my Diſtreſs.
P99R,Mr. Williams is ačtually arreſted, and
carried away to Stamford. So there is an End
of all my Hopes in him. Poor Gentleman! his
Over-ſecurity and Openneſs, have ruin'd us both } :
I was but too well convinced, that we ought not to
have loſt a Moment's time; but he was half angry,
and thought me too impatient; and then his fatal
Confeſſions, and the deteſtable Artifice of my Ma-
ſter!—But one might well think, that he who had
ſo cunningly, and ſo wickedly, contrived all his Stra-
tagems hitherto, that it was impoſſible to avoid
them, would ſtick at nothing to complete them. I
fear I ſhall ſoon find it ſo! ** -
But one Stratagem I have juſt invented, tho’ a
very diſcouraging one to think of ; becauſe I have
neither Friends nor Money, nor know one Step of
the Way, if I was out of the Houſe. But let Bulls,
and Bears, and Lions, and Tygers, and, what is
worſe, falſe, treacherous, deceitful Men, ſtand in
my Way, I cannot be in more Danger than I am;
and I depend nothing upon his three Weeks: For
how do I know, now he is in ſuch a Paſfion, and
has already begun his Vengeance on poor Mr. Wil-
liams, that he will not change his Mind, and come
down to Lincolnſhire before he goes to London? ºr
My Stratagem is this; I will endeavour toget Mrs. .
jewkes to go to-bed without me, as ſhe often does,
while I ſit lock’d up in my Cloſet; and as ſhe ſleeps
very ſound in her firſt Sleep, of which ſhe never fails
to give Notice by ſnoring, if I can but then get out
between the two Bars of the Window, (for you
know, I am very ſlender, and I find I can get my
Head thro') then I can drop upon the Leads under-
a - * * * * neath

neath, which are little more than my Height, and
which Leads are over a little Summer-parlour, that
juts out towards the Garden, and as I am light,
I can eaſily drop from them; for they are not high
from the Ground: Then Iſhall get into the Garden;
and then, as I have the Key of the Back-door, I
will get out. But I have another Piece of Cunning
ſtill; good Heaven, ſucceed to me my dangerous,
but innocent Devices!— I have read of a great
Captain, who being in Danger, leap'd over-board,
into the Sea; and his Enemies ſhooting at him with
Bows and Arrows; he got off his upper Garment,
and ſwam away, while they ſtuck that full of their
Darts and Arrows ; and he eſcaped, and triumphed
over them all. So what will I do, but ſtrip off my
upper Petticoat, and throw it into the Pond, with
my Neck-handkerchief; for, to be ſure, when
they miſs me, they will go to the Pond firſt, think-
ing I have drowned myſelf; and ſo, when they ſee
ſome of my Cloaths floating there, they will be all
employ'd in dragging the Pond, which is a very large
one: and as I ſhall not, perhaps, be miſs'd till the
Morning, this will give me Opportunity to get a
great way off; and I am ſure I will run for it when
I am out. And ſo I truſt, that Providence will di-
rečt my Steps to ſome good Place of Safety, and
make ſome worthy Body my Friend; for ſure, if I
ſuffer ever ſo, I cannot be in more Danger, nor in
worſe Hands, than where I am ; and with ſuch
avow’d bad Deſigns.
O my dear Parents! don’t be frighted when you
come to read this!—But all will be over before
K. can ſee it; and ſo God direct me for the beſt.
y Writings, for fear I ſhould not eſcape, I will
bury in the Garden; for, to be ſure, I ſhall be
ſearch'd, and uſed dreadfully, if I can’t get off. And

ſo I will cloſe here, for the preſent, to prepare for
my Plot. Proſper thou, O gracious Protector of
oppreſſed Innocence I this laſt Effort of thy poor
Handmaid I that I may eſcape the crafty Devices
and Snares that have begun to entangle my Vir-
tue! and from which, but by this one Trial, I ſee
no way of eſcaping! And Oh! whatever becomes
of me, bleſs my dear Parents, and protećt poor
Mr. Williams from Ruin! for he was happy before
he knew me ! -
Juſt now, juſt now! I heard Mrs.jewkes, who is
in her Cups, own, to the horrid Colbrand, that the
robbing of poor Mr. Williams, was a Contrivance
of hers, and executed by the Groom and a Helper,
in crder to ſeize my Letters upon him, which they
miſs'd. They are now both laughing at the diſmal
Story, which they little think I heard—O how
my Heart akes! for what are not ſuch Wretches ca-
pable of ! Can you blame me for endeavouring, thro'
any Danger, to get out of ſuch Clutches?" , *.

with; an Enemy ſhe never thought of before ; and
was hardly able to ſtand againſt. I mean, the Weak-
neſs and Preſumption, both in one, of herown Mind!
which had well nigh, had not divine Grace inter-
poſed, ſunk her into the loweſt laſt Abyſs of Miſery
and Perdition . - (i.
; I will proceed, as I have Opportunity, with my
ſad Relation: For my Pen and Ink (in my now
doubly-ſecur'd Cloſet) is all that I have, beſides my
own Weakneſs of Body, to employ myſelf with :
And, till yeſterday Evening, I have not been able to
hold a Pen. - ..
I took with me but one Shift, beſides what I had
on, and two Handkerchiefs, and two Caps, which
my Pocket held, (for it was not for me to incumber
myſelf) and all my Stock of Money, which was but
five or ſix Shillings, to ſet out for Iknew not where;
and got out of the Window, not without ſome Diffi-
culty, ſticking a little at my Shoulders and Hips;
but I was reſolv’d to get out, if poſſible. And it
was further from the Leads than I thought, and I
was afraid I had ſprain'd my Ancle; and when I had
dropt from the Leads to the Ground, it was ſtill
further off; but I did pretty well there; at leaſt, I
got no Hurt to hinder me from purſuing my Inten-

Papers under a Roſe-buſh, and cover'd them over
with Mould, and there they ſtill lie, as I hope. Then
I hy'd away to the Pond: The Clock ſtruck
Twelve, º: as I got out; and it was a dark miſty
Night, and coldiſh; but I felt none then. . . . . º
* When I came to the Pond-ſide, I flung in my
Upper-coat, as I had deſign'd, and my Neck-
handkerchief, and a round ear’d Cap, with a Knot;
and then with great Speed ran to the Door, and took
the Key out of my Pocket, my poor Heart beating
all the Time againſt my Boſom, as if it would have
forc’d its way thro' it: Andbeat it wellmight! For I
then, toolate, found, that I was moſt miſerably diſap-
pointed; for the wicked Woman had taken off that
Lock, and put another on; ſo that my Key would
not open it. I try’d and try’d, and feeling about,
I found a Padlock beſides, on another Part of the
Door. Othen how my Heart ſunk!—I dropt down
with Grief and Confuſion, unable to ſtir or ſupport
myſelf for a while. But my Fears awakening my
Reſolution, and knowing that my Attempt would be
as terrible for me, as any other Danger I could then
encounter, I clamber'd up upon the Ledges of the
Door, and upon the Lock, which was a great wooden
one, and reached the Top of the Door with m
Hands; then, little thinking I could climb ſo well,
I made ſhift to lay hold on the Top of the Wall with
my Hands; but, alas for me! nothing but ill Luck!
— no Eſcape for poor Pamela / The Wall being
old, the Bricks I held by, gave way, juſt as I was
taking a Spring to get up, and down came I, and
received ſuch a Blow upon my Head, with one of the
Bricks, that it quite ſtunn'd me; and I broke my
Shins and my Ancle beſides, and beat off the Heel
of one of my Shoes,

In this dreadful way, flat upon the Ground, lay
poor l, for I believe five or ſix Minutes; and when
I would have got up, I could hardly ſtand; for I
found I had bruis'd my left Hip and Shoulder, and
was full of Pain with it; and befides my Head bled,
and ak’d with the Blow I had with the Brick.-Yet
this I valued not but crawl’d a good way, upon
my Feet and Hands, in Search of a Ladder, I juſt
recollečted to have ſeen againſt the Wall two Days
before, on which the Gardner was nailing a Ne-
étarine Branch, that was blown off from the Wall:
But no Ladder could I find, and the Wall was very
high. What now, thinks I, muſt become of the
miſerable Pamela! — Then I began to wiſh
myſelf moſt heartily again in my Cloſet, and to re-
pent of my Attempt, which I now cenſur’d as raſh,
becauſe it did not ſucceed. |
º, God forgive me! but a ſad Thought came juſt
then into my Head!--- I tremble to think of it!

meet with, had like to have made me miſerable for
ever! O my dear, dear Parents, forgive your poor
Child; but being then quite deſperate, H crept along
till I could get up on my Feet, tho’ I could hardly
fland; and away limp'd I l—What to do, but to
throw myſelf into the Pond, and ſo put a Period to
all my Griefs in this World!—But, Oh! to find them
infinitely aggravated (had I not, by the Divine
Grace, been with-held) in a miſerable Eternity / As
I have eſcap'd this Temptation, (bleſſed be God for

228 P A M E L A; Or,
It was well for me, as I have ſince thought, that
I was ſo maim’d, as made me the longer before I
got to the Water ; for, this gave me ſome Re-
flection,andabated that Impetuouſneſs of my Paffions,
which poſſibly might otherwiſe have hurry’d me in
my firſt Tranſport of Grief, (on my ſeeing no way to
eſcape, and the hard Uſage I had Reaſon to expect
from my dreadful Keepers) to throw myſelf, in
without Confideration; but my Weakneſs of Body
made me move ſo ſlowly, that it gave Time for
a little Refle&tion, a Ray of Grace, to dart in upon
my benighted Mind; and ſo, when I came to the
Pond-ſide, I ſat myſelf down on the ſloping Bank,
and began to ponder my wretched Condition: And
thus I reaſon'd with myſelf. -
Pauſe here a little, Pamela, on what thou art
about, before thou takeſt the dreadful Leap ; and
conſider whether there be noway yet left, no Hope,
if not to eſcape from this wicked Houſe, yet from
the Miſchiefs threaten’d thee in it. - -
I then confider'd, and after I had caſt about in
my Mind, every thing that could make me hope,
and ſaw no Probability; a wicked Woman devoid of
all Compaſſion a horrid Helper juſt arriv'd in this
dreadful Calbrandſ an angry and reſenting Maſter,
who now hated me, and threaten’d the moſt afflićt-
ing Evils! and, that I ſhould, in all Probability, be
depriv'd even of the Opportunity I now had before
me, to free myſelf from all their Perſecutions. --
What haſt thou to do, diſtreſſed Creature, ſaid I
to myſelf, but throw thyſelf upon a merciful God,
(who knows how innocently I ſuffer) to avoid the
mercileſs Wickedneſs of thoſe who are determin'd on
my Ruin: - •
And then thought I, (and Oh! that Thought was
ſurely of the Devil's Inſtigation; for it was very ſooth-
ing, and powerful with me) theſe wicked wº

who now have no Remorſe, no Pity on me,will then
be mov’d to lament their Miſdoings; and when they
fee the dead Corpſe of the unhappy Pamela dragg'd
out to theſe ſlopy. Banks, and lying breathleſs at their
Feet, they will find that Remorſe to wring theirob-
durate Hearts, which, now, has no Place there!-
And my Maſter, my angry Maſter, will then forget
his Reſentments, and ſay, O this is the unhappy
Pamela 1 that I have ſo cauſeleſly perſecuted and de-
ſtroy’d! Now do I ſee ſhe preferr'd her Honeſty to
her Life, will he ſay, and is no Hypocrite, nor De-
ceiver; but really was the innocent Creature ſhe pre-
tended to be! Then, thinks I, will he, perhaps, ſhed
a few Tears over the poor Corſe of his perſecuted
Servant ; and, tho’ he may give out, it was I.Ove
and Diſappointment, and that too, (in order to hide
his own Guilt) for the unfortunate Mr. Williams,
perhaps; yet will he be inwardly griev'd, and order
me a decent Funeral, and ſave me, or rather this
Part of me, from the dreadful Stake, and the High-
way Interrment; and the young Men and Maidens
all-around my dear Father's, will pity poor Pamela'ſ
But O! I hope I ſhall not be the Subjećt of their
Ballads and Elegies ; but that my Memory, for the
ſake of my dear Father and Mother, may quickly
ſlide into Oblivion!... * -
I was once riſing, ſo indulgent was I to this ſadway
of thinking, to throw myſelf in : But again, my
Bruiſes made meſlow; and I thought, What art thou
about to do, wretched Pamela P how knoweſt thou,
tho' the Proſpect be all dark to thy ſhort-fighted Eye,
what God may do for thee, even when all human
Means fail? God Almighty would not lay me un-

This A&t of Deſpondency, thought I, is a Sin, that,
if I purſue it, admits of no Repentance, and can
therefore claim no Forgiveneſs.--And-wilt thou, for

I will continue my ſad Relation.

and not finding me in Bed, ſhe call'd me; and no

Anſwer being return'd, ſhe relates, that ſhe got out
of Bed, and run to my Cloſet; and not finding me,
ſearched under the Bed, and in another Cloſet, find-
ing the Chamber-door as ſhe had left it, quite faſt,
and the Key, as uſual, about her Wriſt. For if I
could have got out at the Chamber-door; there were
two or three Paſſages, and Doors to them all, double
lock'd and barr'd, to go thro’, into the great Gar-
den ; ſo that, to eſcape, there was no Way, but
that of the Window; and that very Window,
becauſe of the Summer-parlour under it; for the
other Windows are a great way from the Ground.
She ſays ſhe was exceſſively frighted, and in-
ſtantly rais'd the Swift, and the two Maids, who
lay not far off; and finding every Door faſt, ſhe ſaid;
I muſt be carry'd away as St. Peter was out of Pri-
ſon, by ſome Angel. It is a Wonder ſhe had not a
worſe Thought!
She ſays, ſhe wept and wrung her Hands, and
took on ſadly, running about like a mad Woman,
little thinking I could have got out of the Cloſet
Window, between the Iron Bars; and indeed I don’t
know if I could do ſo again. But at laſt finding
that Caſement open, they concluded it muſt be ſo;
and ſo they ran out into the Garden, and found
my Footſteps in the Mould of the Bed which I
dropt down upon from the Leads: And ſo ſpeeded
away, all of them, that is to ſay, Mrs.jewkes, Colbrand
and Nan, towards the Back-door, to ſee if that was
faſt, while the Cook was ſent te the Out-offices to
raiſe the Men, and make them get Horſes ready,
to take each a ſeveral Way to purſue me. -
But it ſeems, finding that Door double-lock'd
and padlock'd, and the Heel of my Shoe, and the
broken Bricks, they verily concluded I was got away
by ſome Means, ever the Wall; and then, they
ſay, Mrs, jewkes ſeem’d like a diſtraćted wº

<page 277>
234 P A M E L A ; Or, a
Till at laſt, Nan had the Thought to go towards the
Pond, and there ſeeing my Coat, and Cap and Hand-
kerchief in the Water, caſt almoſt to the Banks by
the daſhing of the Waves, ſhe thought it was me,
and ſcreaming out, run to Mrs. Jewkes, and ſaid,
Q Madam, Madam! here's a piteous Thing 1-
Mrs. Pamela lies drown'd in the Pond l—Thither
they all ran and finding my Cloaths, doubted not
I was at the Bottom; and they all, Swiſs among the
reſt, beat their Breaſts, and made moſt diſmal La-
mentations; and Mrs. jewkes ſent Nan to the Men,
to bid them get the Drag-net ready, and leave the
Horſes, and come to try to find the poor Innocent!
as ſhe, it ſeems, then call'd me, beating her Breaſt,
and lamenting my hard Hap; but moſt what would
become of them, and what Account they ſhould
give to my Maſter.
While every one was thus differently employ'd,
ſome weeping and wailing, ſome running here and
there, Nan came into the Wood-houſe ; and there
lay poor I; ſo weak, ſo low, and dejećted, and withal
ſo ſtiff with my Bruiſes, that I could not ſtir nor
help myſelf to get upon my Feet. And I ſaid, with
a low Voice, (for I could hardly ſpeak) Mrs. Ann,
Mrs. Ann /–The Creature was ſadly frighted, but
was taking up a Billet to knock me on the Head,
believing I was ſome Thief, as ſhe ſaid; but I cry’d
out, OMrs. Ann, Mrs. Ann, help me, for Pity’s ſake,
to Mrs. Jewkes / for I cannot get up!---Bleſs me,
ſaid ſhe, what!' you, Madam ---Why our Hearts
are almoſt broke, and we were going to drag the
Pond for you, believing you had drown'd yourſelf.
Now, ſaid ſhe, you’ll make us all alive again!
And without helping me, ſhe run away to the
Pond, and brought all the Crew to the Wood-houſe.

crafts! She ſhall dearly repent of this Trick, if my
Name be jewkes; and coming to me, took hold of
my Arm, ſo roughly, and gave me ſuch a Pull, as
made me ſqueal out, (my Shoulder being bruis'd on
that Side) and drew me on my Face. O cruel Crea-
ture! ſaid I, if you knew what I have ſuffer'd, it
would move you to pity me ! -
Even Colbrand ſeem'd to be concern'd, and ſaid,
Fie, Madam, fiel you ſee ſhe is almoſt dead! You
muſt not be ſo, rough with her. The Coachman
Fobin ſeem'd to be ſorry for me too, and ſaid,
with Sobs, What a Scene is here ! Don't you ſee
fhe is all bloody in her Head, and cannot ſtir 2–
Curſe of her Contrivances! ſaid the horridCreature;
£he has frighted me out of my Wits, I’m ſure. How
the D–l came you here?–O! ſaid I, ask me now
no Queſtions, but let the Maids carry me up to my
Priſon; and there let me die decently, and in Peace!
For indeed I thought I could not live two Hours. .
. The ſtill more inhuman Tygreſs ſaid, I ſuppoſe
you want Mr. Williams to pray by you, don't you?
Well, I’ll ſend for my Maſter this Minute; let him
come and watch you himſelf, for me; for there's
no ſuch thing as holding you, I’m ſure. *
So the Maids took me up between them, and car-
ry'd me to my Chamber; and when the Wretch
ſaw how bad I was, ſhe began a little to relent--while
every one wonder'd (at what I had neither Strength
nor Inclination to tell them) how all this came to paſs
which they imputed to Sorcery and Witchcraft.
I was ſo weak, when I had got up Stairs, that I
fainted away, with Dejećtion, Pain and Fatigue;
and they undreſs'd me, and got me to Bed, and Mrs.
jewkes order'd Nan to bathe my Shoulder, and Arm,
and Ancle, with ſome old Rum warm'd; and they
cut the Hair a little from the back Part of my Head,
and waſh'd that; for it was clotted with Blood, from
a pretty

a pretty long, but not deep Gaſh; and put a Family
Plaiſter upon it; for if this Woman has any good
Quality, it is, it ſeems, in a Readineſs and Skill to
manage in Caſes, where ſudden Misfortunes happen
in a Family. - * *
* After this, I fell into a pretty ſound and refreſh-
ing Sleep, and lay till Twelve o’Clock, tolerably
eaſy, conſidering I was very feveriſh and aguiſhly in-
clin’d ; and ſhe took a deal of Care to fit me
to undergo more Trials, which I had hop'd would
have been more happily ended: But Providence
did not ſee fit. -
She would make me riſe about Twelve; but I was
ſo weak, I could only fit up till the Bedwas made,and
went into it again; and was, as they ſaid, delirious
ſome Part of the Afternoon. But having a tolerable
Night on Thurſday, I was a good deal better on
Friday, and on Saturday got up, and eat a little
Spoon-meat, and my Feveriſhneſs ſeem'd to be gone,
and I was ſo mended by Evening, that I begg’d her
Indulgence in my Cloſet, to be left to myſelf; which
ſhe conſented to, it being double-barr'd the Day
before, and I aſſuring her that all my Contrivances,
as ſhe call'd them, were at an End. But firſt ſhe
made me tell her the whole Story of my Enterprize ;
which I did very faithfully, knowing now that no-
thing could ſtand me in any ſtead, or contribute tomy
Safety and Eſcape: And ſhe ſeem'd full of Wonder
at my Reſolution and Ventureſomeneſs, but told me
frankly, that I ſhould have found a hard Matter to
get quite off; for, that ſhe was provided witha War-
rant from my Maſter, (who is a Juſtice of Peace in
this County, as well as the other) to get me appre-
hended, if I had got away, on Suſpicion of wrong-
ing him, let me have been where I would.

me the Truth of what was hinted to me formerly at
the other Houſe, that my Maſter ſwore he would have
me! O preſerve me, Heaven! from being his, in

I muſt add, that now this Woman ſees me pick
up ſo faſt, ſhe uſes me worſe, and has abridg’d me of
Paper all but one Sheet, which I am to ſhew her
written or unwritten on Demand, and has reduc’d

You may believe ſhe muſt talk ſadly to make me ſay
ſuch harſh Words: Indeed it cannot be repeated ;
and ſhe is a Diſgrace to her Sex. And then ſhe ri-
dicules me, and laughs at my Notions of Honeſty;
and tells me, impudent Creature that ſhe is what a
fine Bedfellow I ſhallmake for my Maſter, (and ſuch-
like) with ſuch whimſical Notions about me !—

was ready to die with Grief and Apprehenſion.—
He ſaid, Well may you hide your Face! well may
łyou be aſhamed to ſee me, vile forward one, as you
are!—I ſobb'd, and wept, but could not ſpeak.
“And he let me lie, and went to the Door, and called

I had but juſt finiſhed takinga Copy of this, and
laid the Letter where Ibad it, and unbolted the Door,
when ſhe came up in a great Fright, for fear I ſhould
have ſeen it; but I being in my Cloſet, and that
}. as ſhe left it, ſhe did not miſłruſt. O, ſaid ſhe,
'I was afraid you had ſeen my Maſter's Letter here,
which I careleſly left on the Table. I wiſh, ſaid I, I
had known that. Why ſure, ſaid ſhe, if you had,
you would not have offered to read my Letters! In-
deed, ſaid I, I ſhould, at this time, if it had been
in my way:---Do, let me ſee it.--Well, ſaid ſhe, I
wiſh poor Mr. Williams well off: I underſtand my
Maſter is gone to makeup Matters with him; which
is very good. To be ſure, added ſhe, he is a very good
Gentleman, and very forgiving! --Why, ſaid I, as
if I had known nothing of the Matter, how can he
make up Matters with him? Is not Mr. Williams at
Stamford? Yes, ſaid ſhe, I believe ſo ; but Parſon
. Peters pleads for him, and he is gone with him to
Stamford, and will not be back to-night: So, we
have nothing to do, but to eat our Suppers betimes,
and go to-bed. Ay, that's pure, ſaid I ; and I ſhall
have good Reſt, this Night, I hope. So, ſaid ſhe,
%. might every Night, but for your own idle
ears. You are afraid of your Friends, when none
are near you." Ay, that's true, ſaid I; for I have
not one near me. . . . . . . . . . . . .
So have I one more good honeſt Night before me:
What the next may be, I know not; and ſo I’ll try
to take in a good deal of Sleep, while I can be a little
eaſy. #. here I ſay, Good-night, my dear Pº-
rents; for I have no more to write about this Night:

OR the future, I will always miſtruſt moſt,
when Appearances look faireſt. O your poor
Daughter what has ſhe not ſuffer'd ſince what I
wrote of Sunday Night !---My worſt Trial, and my
fearfulleſt Danger O how I ſhudder to write you
an Account of this wicked Interval of Time! For,
my dear Parents, will you not be too much frighten’d
and affected with my Diſtreſs, when I tell you, that
his Journey to Stamford was all abominable Pre-
tence for he came home privately, and had well
nigh effected all his vile Purpoſes, and the Ruin of
your poor Daughter; and that by ſuch a Plot as I
was not in the leaſt apprehenfive of: And Oh! you’ll
hear what a vile and unwomanly Part that wicked
Wretch, Mrs. Jewkes, ačted in it!
I left off with letting you know how much I was
pleaſed, that I had one Night's Reprieve added to
my Honeſty. But I had leſs Occaſion to rejoice
than ever, as you will judge by what I have ſaid
already. Take then the dreadful Story as well as I
can relate it. - - - **
The Maid Nan is a little apt to drink, if ſhe can
get at Liquor ; and Mrs. Jewkes happen'd, or de-
ſign'd, as is too probable, to leavea Bottle of Cherry-
brandy in her way, and the Wench drank ſome of
it more than ſhe ſhould; and when ſhe came in to lay
the Cloth, Mrs. Jewkes perceiv'd it, and fellarating
at her moſt ſadly; for ſhe has too many Faults of
her own, to ſuffer any of the like ſort in any body
elſe, if ſhe can help it; and ſhe bid her get out
of her Sight, when we had ſupp'd, and go to-
bed, to ſleep off her Liquor, before we came to-
bed.

bed. And ſo the poor Maid went muttering up
Stairs. - - - -
About two Hours after, which was near Eleven
o'Clock, Mrs. Žewkes and I went up to go to-bed; I
pleaſing myſelf with what a charming Night I ſhould
have. We lock'd both Doors, and ſaw poor Nan, as
I thought, (for Oh!’twas my abominable Maſter, as
ou ſhall hear by-and-by) ſitting faſt aſleep, in an
lbow-chair, in a dark Corner of the Room, with
her Apron thrown over her Head and Neck. And
Mrs.jewkes ſaid, There is that Beaſtofa Wench faſt
aſleep, inſtead of being a bed! I knew, ſaid ſhe,
ſhe had taken a fine Doſe. I’ll wake her, ſaid I,
No, don’t, ſaid ſhe, let her ſleep on ; we ſhall lie
better without her. Ay, ſaid I, ſo we ſhall; but
won't ſhe get Cold * * * *
Said ſhe, I hope you have no Writing to-night.
No, reply'd I, I will go to-bed with you, Mrs
jewkes. Said ſhe, I wonder what you can find to
write about ſo much; and am ſure you have better
Gonveniencies of that kind, and more Paper, than
I am aware of; and I had intended to romage you,
if my Maſter had not come down; for I’ſpy’d a
broken Tea-cup with Ink, which gave me a Suſpi-
eion; but as he is come, let him look after you, if he
will ; and if you deceive him, it will behis own Fault.
All this time we were undreſfing ourſelves. And
I fetch'd a deep Sigh! What do you figh for? ſaid
fhe, I am thinking, Mrs. Jewkes, anſwer'd I, what
a ſad Life I live, and how hard is my Lot. I am
ſure the Thief that has robb'd, is much better off
than I,’bating the Guilt; and Iſhould, Ithink, take
it for a Mercy, to be hang'd out of the way, rather
than live in theſecruel Apprehenſions. So, being not
ſleepy, and in a prattling Vein, Ibegan to give a little
Hiſtory of myſelf, as I did once before to Mrs. Žer-
vis; in this manner: -
N 2 - Here,

<page 311>
268 P A M E. L. A.; Or,
Here, ſaid I, were my poor honeſt Parents; they
took care to inſtil good Principles into my Mind,
till I was almoſt twelve Years of Age; and taught
me to prefer-Goodneſs and Poverty to the higheſt
Condition of Life; and they confirm'd their Leſſons
by their own Pračtice; for they were of late Years
remarkably poor, and always as remarkably honeſt,
even to a Proverb; for, As honeſ as Goodman
AND REws, was a Bye-word. . . . . . . -
Well then, ſaid I, comes my late dear good Lady,
and takes a Fancy to me, and ſaid, ſhe would be the
...; of me, if I was a good Girl; and ſhe put
me to ſing, to dance, to play on the Spinnet, in order
to divert her melancholy Hours; and alſo learnt me
all manner of fine Needle-work; but ſtill this was
her Leſſon, My good Pamela, be virtuous, and keep
the Men at a Diſtance: Well, ſo I was, I hope, and
ſo I did; and yet, tho' I ſay it, they all loved me
and reſpected me; and would do anything for me,
as if I was a Gentlewoman. . º ºr
But then, what comes next?---Why, it pleaſed
God to take my good Lady; and then comes my
Maſter: And what ſays he?---Why, in Effect, it
is, Be Not Wirtuous, Pamela. . . . . . . . . . . . .
So here have I lived above ſixteen Years in Virtue
and Reputation, and, all 'at once, when I come to
know what is Good, and what is Evil, I muſt re-
nounce all the Good, all the whole Sixteen Years In-
nocence, which, next to God’s Grace, I owed chiefly
to my Parents and my Lady's good Leſſons and Ex-
amples; and chuſe the Evil; and ſo, in a Moment’s
Time, become the vileſt of Creatures! And all this,
for what, I pray : Why truly, for a Pair of Diamond
Far-rings, a Necklace, and a Diamond Ring for my
Finger; which would not become me : for a few
paltry fine Cloaths; which when I wore, it would
make but my former Poverty more ridiculous to
º, . . . every

<page 312>
Vºr R T u e Rewarded. 269
every body that ſawme; eſpecially when they knew
the baſe Terms I wore them upon. But indeed, I
was to have a great Parcel of Guineas beſide; I
forget how many; for had there been ten tim's
more, they would have been not ſo much to me,
as the honeſt Six Guineas you trick'd me out of,
Mrs. Yewkes. - * . . . . .
Well, forſooth but then I was to have I know
not how many Pounds a Year for my Life; and my
poor Father (there was the Jeſt of it !) was to be the
Manager for the abandon’d Proſtitute his Daughter:
And then (there was the Jeſt again!) my kind, for-
giving, virtuous Maſter, would pardon me all my
Miſdeeds! -
- Yes, thank him for nothing, truly. And what,
pray, are all theſe violent Miſdeeds?---Why, they
are for daring to adhere to the good Leſſons that
were taught me; and not learning a new one, that
would have reverſed all my former: For not being
contented when I was run away with, in order to
ruin me; but contriving, if my poor Wits had been
able, to get out of Danger, and preſerve myſelf
honeſt. . . -- " - - - - º
: Then was he once jealous of poor john, tho’ he
knew john was his own Creature, and helped to
deceive me. ** -
Then was he outrageous againſt poor Parſon Wil-
liams; and him has this good, merciful Maſter
thrown into Goal; and for what? Why truly, for
that being a Divine, and a good Man, he had the
Fear of God before his Eyes, and was willing to
forego all his Expectations of Intereſt, and aſſiſt an
oppreſſed poor Creature. . . . -
But to be ſure, I muſt be forward, bold, ſaucy,
and what not? to dare to runaway from certain Ruin,
and to ſtrive to eſcape from an unjuſt Confinement;
and Imuſt be married to the Parſon, nothing ſo ſure t

He would have had but a poor Catch of me, had I
conſented; but he, and you too, know, I did not want
to marry any body. I only wanted to go to my poor
Parents, and to have my own Liberty, and not to
be confined to ſuch an unlawful Reſtraint ; and
which would not be inflićted upon me, but only that
1 am a poor, deſtitute, young Body, and have no
Friend that is able to right me. . .
So, Mrs. Jewkes, ſaid I, here is my Hiſtory in
brief. And I am a very unhappy young Creature,
to be ſure ---And why am I ſo?---Why, becauſe
my Maſter ſees ſomething in my Perſon that takes
his preſent Fancy; and becauſe I would not be un-
done.---Why therefore, to chuſe, I muſt, and I
ſhall be undone!---And this is all the Reaſon that
can be given - º - -
She heard me run on all this time, while I, was
undreſfing, without any Interruption ; and I ſaid,
Well, I muſt go to the two Cloſets, ever ſince an
Affair of the Cloſet at the other Houſe, tho’ he is
fo far off. And I have a good mind to wake this poor
Maid. No, don’t, ſaid ſhe, I charge you... lam
very angry with her, and ſhe'll get no Harm there;
but if ſhe wakes, ſhe may come to-bedwell enough,
as long as there is a Candle in the Chimney. -
So I looked into the Cloſets, and kneeled down in
my own, as I uſed to do, to ſay my Prayers, and this
with my under Cloaths in my Hand, all undreſt; and
paſſed by the poor ſleeping Wench, as I thought, in
my Return. But, Oh! little did I think, it was my
wicked, wicked Maſter in a Gown and Petticoat of
hers, and her Apron, over his Face and Shoulders,
What Meanneſſes will not Lucifer make his Wota-
ries ſtoop to, to gain their abominable Ends!
- Mrs. Jewkes, by this time, was got to-bed, on
the further Side, as ſhe uſed to be ; and, to make
room for the Maid, when ſhe ſhould awake, I got
- into

into Bed, and lay cloſe to her. And I ſaid, Where
are the Keys? tho’, ſaid I, I am not ſo much afraid
to-night. Here, ſaid the wicked Woman, put your
Arm under mine, and you ſhall find them about my
Wriſt, as they uſed to be. So I did, and the abomi-
nable Deſigner held my Hand with her Right-hand,
as my Right-arm was under her Left.
In leſs than a quarter of an Hour, I ſaid, There's
poor Nan awake; I hear her ſtir. Let us go to
ſleep, ſaid ſhe, and not mind her: She’ll come to-
bed, when ſhe's quite awake. Poor Soul ſaid I,
I’ll warrant ſhe will have the Head-ach finely to-
morrow for it! Be ſilent, ſaid ſhe, and go to ſleep;
you keep me awake; and I never found you in ſo
talkative a Humour in my Life. - Don’t chide me,
ſaid I; I will ſay but one thing more: Do you
think Nancouldhear me talk of my Maſter's Offers?
No, no, ſaid ſhe ; ſhe was dead aſleep. I’m glad of
that, ſaid i ; becauſe I would not expoſe my Maſter
to his common Servants; and I knew you were no
Stranger to his fine Articles. Said ſhe, I think they
were fine Articles, and you were bewitch'd you did
not cloſe in with them: Butlet us go to ſleep. So
I was filent; and the pretended Nan (O wicked
baſe, villainous Deſigner! what a Plot, what an
unexpected Plot, was this 1) ſeem'd to be awaking;
and Mrs. Jewkes, abhorred Creature! ſaid, Come,
Nant---what, are you awake at laſt? Pr’ythee come
to-bed; for Mrs. Pamela is in a talking Fit, and
won’t go to ſleep one while.
!. At that the pretended She came to the Bed ſide;
and ſitting down in a Chair, where the Curtain hid
her, began to undreſs. Said I, Poor Mrs. Ann, I
warrant your Head aches moſt ſadly How do you
do?---She anſwer'd not one Word. Said the ſu-
perlatively wicked Woman, You know I have or-
N 4 der'd
-

<page 315>
272 P A M E L A ; Or,
der'd her not to anſwer you. And this Plot, to be
ſure, was laid when ſhe gave her theſe Orders, the
Night before.
. I heard her, as I thought, breathe all quick and
ſhort: Indeed, ſaid I, Mrs. Jewkes, the poor Maid
is not well. What ails you, Mrs. Ann? And ſtill
no Anſwer was made. *
. . But, I tremble to relate it! the pretended She
came into Bed; but quiver'd like an Aſpen-leaf;
aad I, poor Fool that I was pitied her much.--But
well might the barbarous Deceiver trembleathis vile
Diſfimulation, and baſe Deſigns.
What Words ſhall I find, my dear Mother, (for
my Father ſhould not ſee this ſhocking Part) to de-
ſcribe the reſt, and my Confuſion, when theguilty
Wretch took my left Arm, and laid it under his
Neck, as the vile Kººiſ. held my Right; and then
he claſp'd me round my Waiſt!-
Said I, Is the Wench mad! Why, how now,
Confidence? thinking ſtill it had been Nan. But he
kiſſed me with frightful Vehemence; and then his
Voice broke upon melikea Clap of Thunder. Now,
Pamela, ſaid he, is the dreadful Time of Reckoning
come, that I have threaten’d.---I ſcream'd out in
ſuch a manner, as never any body heard the like.
But there was nobody to help me: And both my
Hands were ſecured, as I ſaid. Sure never poor
Soul was in ſuch Agonies as I. Wicked Man l ſaid.
I; wicked, abominable Woman! O God! my God!
this Time, this one Time! deliver me from this Di-
ftreſs or ſtrike me dead, this Moment. And then
I ſcream'd again and again. ... . . . . --
Says he, One Word with you, Pamela; one Word
hear me but ; and hitherto you ſee I offer nothing
to you... Is this nothing, ſaid I, to be in Bed here *
To hold my Hands between you? I will hear, if

you will inſtantly leave the Bed, and take this vil-
lainous Woman from me! . . . . .”.
Said ſhe, (O Diſgrace of Womankind!) What
you do, Sir, do; don’t ſtand dilly-dallying. She
cannot exclaim worſe than ſhe has done. And ſhe'll
be quieter when ſhe knows the worſt.
Silence! ſaid he to her; I muſt ſay one Word
to you, Pamela; it is this: You ſee, now you are in
my Power ---You cannot get from me, nor help
yourſelf: Yet have I not offer'd any thing amiſs to .
you. But if you reſolve not to comply with my
Propoſals, I will not loſe this Opportunity: If you
do, I will yet-leave you. . .
O Sir, ſaid I, leave me, leave me but, and I will do
anything I ought to do.---Swear then to me, ſaid
he, that you will accept my Propoſals!---and then
(for this was alldeteſtable Grimace) heput'his Hand
in my Boſom. With Struggling, Fright, Terror,
I fainted away quite, and did not come to myſelf
ſoon; ſo that they both, from the cold Sweats that
I was in, thought me dying---And I remember no
more, than that, when, with great Difficulty, they
brought me to myſelf, ſhe was ſitting on one ſide of
the Bed, with her Cloaths on ; and he on the other
with his, and in his Gown and Slippers.
Your poor Pamela cannot anſwer for the Liber-
ties taken with her in her deplorable State of Death.
And when I ſaw them there, I ſat up in my Bed,
without any Regard to what Appearance I made,
and nothing about my Neck; and he ſoothing me,
with an Aſpect of Pity and Concern, I put my
Hand to his Mouth, and ſaid, O tell me, yet tell
me not, what I have ſuffer'd in this Diſtreſs And
I talked quite wild, and knew not what; for, to be
ſure, I was on the Point of Diſtraćtion.
He moſt ſolemnly, and with a bitter Imprecation,
vow'd, that he had not offer'd the leaſt Indecency;

that he was frighten’d at the terrible manner I was
taken with the Fit: That he would deſiſt from his
Attempt; and begg’d but to ſee me eaſy and quiet,
and he would leave me directly, and go to his own.
Bed... O then, ſaid I, take from me this moſt wick-
ed Woman, this vile Mrs.jewkes, as an Earneſt
that I may believe you! . . . - -
And will you, Sir, ſaid the wicked Wretch, for a
Fit or two, give up fuch an Opportunity as this?—
I thought you had known the Sex better.—She is
now, you fee, quite well again? +
: This I heard; more ſhe might ſay; but I fainted
away once more, at theſe Words, and at his claſping
his Arms about me again. And when I came a little
to myſelf, I ſaw him fit there, and the Maid Nan,
holding a Smelling-bottle to my Noſe, and no Mrs.
jewkes. - -
He ſaid, taking my Hand, Now will I vow to
you, my dear Pamela, that I will leave you the Mo-
ment I ſee you better, and pacify’d. Here's Nan
knows, and will tell you, my Concern for you. I
vow to God, I have not offered any Indecency to
you. And ſince I found Mrs. #ewkes ſo offenſive
to you, I have ſent her to the Maid's Bed, and the
Maid ſhall lie with you to-night. And but promiſe
me that you will compoſe yourſelf, and I will leave
you. But, ſaid I, will not Nan alſo hold my Hand?
And will not ſhe let you come in again to me?-
He ſaid, by Heaven! I will not come in again
to-night. Nan, undreſs yourſelf, go to-bed, and
do all you can to comfort the dear Creature: And
now, Pamela, ſaid he, give me but your Hand,
and ſay you forgive me, and I will leave you to
your Repoſe. I held out my trembling Hand,
which he vouchſafed to kiſs, and I ſaid, God for-
give you, Sir, as you have been juſt in my Diſtreſs;
and as you will be juſt to what you promiſe And

he withdrew, with a Countenance of Remorſe, as
I hoped; and ſhe ſhut the Doors, and, at my Re-
queſt, brought the Keys to-bed.
This, O my dear Parents was a moſt dreadful
Trial. I tremble ſtill to think of it; and dare not
recal all the horrid Circumſtances of it. I hope,
as he aſſures me, he was not guilty of Indecency ;
but have Reaſon to bleſs God, who, by diſabling
me in my Faculties, enabled me to preſerve my
Innocence ; and when all my Strength would have
ſignified nothing, magnified himſelf in my Weak-
neſs. -
I was ſo weak all Day on Monday, that Ilaya-bed.
My Maſter ſhew’d great Tenderneſs for me; and
I hope he is really ſorry, and that this will be his laſt
Attempt; but he does not ſay ſo neither.
He camg in the Morning, as ſoon as he heard the
Door open: And I began to be fearful. He ſtopt
ſhort of the Bed, and ſaid, Rather than give you
Apprehenſions, I will come no further. I ſaid,
Your Honour, Sir, and your Mercy, is all I have
to beg. He ſat himſelf on the Side of the Bed,
and aſked kindly how I did ---begg'd me to be
compos’d; ſaid Yſ. look’d a little wildly. And
I ſaid, Pray; good Sir, let me not ſee this infamous
Mrs. Jewkes; I doubt I cannot bear her Sight.
She ſhan’t come near you all this Day, if you’ll
promiſe to compoſe yourſelf. Then, Sir, I will
try. He preſſed my Hand very tenderly, and went
out. What a Change does this ſhew 1---O may it
be laſting! But alas! he ſeems only to have alter'd
his Method of Proceeding ; but retains, I doubt,
his wicked Purpoſe! -
On Tueſday about Ten o’Clock, when my Maſter
heard I was up, he ſent for me down into the F.

lour. When I came, he ſaid, Come nearer to me,
Pamela. I did ſo, and he took my Hand, and ſaid, -
You begin to look well again. I am glad of it. You
little Slut, how didyou frightenmeon Sunday Night!
—Sir, ſaid I, pray name not that Night; and my
Eyes overflow’d at the Remembrance, and I turn'd
my Head aſide. … , -
Said he, Place ſome little Confidence in me: I
know what thoſe charming Eyesmean, and you ſhall
not need to explain yourſelf: For I do aſſure you,
that as ſoon as I ſaw you change, and a cold Sweat
bedev your pretty Face, and you fainted away, I
quitted the Bed, and Mrs. jewkes did ſo too. And I
put on my Gown, and ſhe fetch'd her Smelling-bottle,
and we did all we could to reſtoreyou; and my Paſſion
for you was all ſwallowed up in the Concern Ihad for
your Recovery; for I thought I never ſaw a Fit ſo
ſtrong and violent in my Life; and fear'd we ſhould
not bring you to Life again; for what I ſaw you in
once before, was nothing to it. This, ſaid he, might
be my Folly, and my Unacquaintedneſs with what
}. Sex can ſhew when they are in Earneſt. But this
repeat to you, that your Mind may be intirely com-
forted—All I offer'd to you, (and that, I am ſure,
was innocent) was before you fainted away. º
Sir, ſaid I, that was very bad : And it was too
plain you had the worſt Defigns. When, ſaid he,
I tell you the Truth in one Inſtance, you may believe
me in the other. I know not, I declare beyond this
lovely Boſom, your Sex; but that I did intend what ".
you call the worſt, is moſt certain: And tho’ I
would not too much alarm you now, I could curſe
my Weakneſs, and my Folly, which makes me own,
that I love you beyond all your Sex, and cannot live
without you. But, if I am Maſter of myſelf, and my
own Reſolution, I will not attempt to force you to
any thing agaip, Sir, ſaid I, you may eaſily keep
º - your

<page 320>
V 1 R T u e Rewarded. 277
your Reſolution, if you will ſend me out of your
way, to my poor Parents; that is all I beg. . . . .
'Tis a Folly to talk of it, ſaid he. You muſt not,
ſhall not go!. And if I could be aſſur’d you would
not attempt it, you ſhould have better Uſage, and
our Confinement ſhould be made eaſier to you,
}. to what End, Sir, am I to ſtay? ſaid I: %. -
yourſelf ſeem not ſure you can keep your own pre- .
ſent good Reſolutions; and do you think, if I was
to ſtay, when I could get away, and be ſafe, it would
not look, as if either I confided too much in my
own Strength, or would tempt my Ruin? And as
if I was not in Earneſt to wiſh myſelf ſafe and out
of Danger?–And then, how long am I to ſtay ? "
And to what Purpoſe?, And in what Light muſt I
.appear to the World? Would not that cenſure me,
altho' I might be innocent And you will allow,
Sir, that if there be any thing valuable or exemplary
in a good Name, or fair Reputation, one muſt
not deſpiſe the World's Cenſure, if one can avoid
1t. . - .
Well, ſaid he, I ſent not for you on this Account,
juſt now; but for two Reaſons: The firſt is, that
you promiſe me, that for a Fortnight to come you
will not offer to go away without my expreſs Con-
ſent; and this I expect for your own ſake, that I may
give you a little more Liberty. And the ſecond
is, That you will ſee and forgive Mrs. jewkes :
She takes on much, and thinks, that, as all her Fault
was her Obedience to me, it would be very hard
to ſacrifice her, as ſhe calls it, to your Reſent-
ment. . - - º
As to the firſt, Sir, ſaid I, it is a hard Injunétion, "
for the Reaſons I have mentioned. And as to the
ſecond, conſidering her vile unwomanly Wicked- '
neſs, and her Endeavours to inſtigate you more to .
ruin me, when your returning Goodneſs *: to "

have ſome Compaſſion upon me, it is ſtill harder.
But to ſhew my Obedience to your Commands,
(for you know, my dear Parents, I might as well
make a Merit of my Compliance, when my Re-
fuſal would ſtand me in no ſtead) I will con-
ſent to both; and to every thing elſe, that you
ſhall be pleas'd to injoin, which I can do with
Innocence. - :
That's my good Girl! ſaid he, and kiſs'd me. This
is quite prudent, and ſhews me, that you don't take
inſolent Advantage of my Favour for you; and will,
perhaps, ſtand you in more ſtead than you are aware
of. -
So he rung the Bell, and ſaid, call down Mrs.
jewkes. She came down, and he took my Hand,
and put it into hers; and ſaid, Mrs. Žewkes, I am
oblig'd to you for all your Diligence and Fidelity to
me; but Pamela, I muſt own, is not; becauſe the
Service Lemploy'd you in was not ſo very obliging to
her, as I could have wiſh’d ſhe would have thought
it; and you were not to favour her, but obey me.
But yet I'll aſſure you, at the very firſt Word, ſhe
has once obliged me, by conſenting to be Friends
with you; and, if ſhe gives me no great Cauſe, I
ſhall not, perhaps, put you on ſuch diſagreeable Ser-
vice again.---Now, therefore, be you once more
Bed-fellows and Board-fellows, as I may ſay, for
ſome Days longer; and ſee that Pamela ſends no
Letters nor Meſſages out of the Houſe, nor keeps a
Correſpondence unknown to me, eſpecially with that
Williams; and, as for the reſt, ſhew the dear Girl all
the Reſpect that is due to one I muſt love, if ſhe will
deſerve it, as I hope ſhe will yet ; and let her be
under no unneceſſary or harſh Reſtraints. But your
watchful Care is not, however, to ceaſe: And re-
member, that you are not to diſoblige me, to oblige
her; and that I will not, cannot, yet part with her.

would be glad ſtill to do me a good Turn, if it lay
in her Power. . . . . . . . . . i.
I took Courage then to drop a Word or two for
poor Mr. Williams; but he was angry with me for
it, and ſaid, he could not endure to hear his Name
in my Mouth; ſo I was forc’d to have done for that
time, •º
All this time my Papers that I had bury’d under
the Roſe-buſh, lay there ſtill; and I begg’d for Leave
to ſend a Letter to you. . So I ſhould, he ſaid, if he
might read it firſt. But this did not anſwer my De-
ſign; and yet I would have ſent you ſuch a Letter
as he might ſee, if I had been ſure my Danger was
over. But that I cannot ; for he now ſeems to take
another Method, and what I am more afraid of, be-
cauſe, may-be, he may watch an Opportunity, and
join Force with it, on Occaſion, when I am leaſt
prepar'd : For now he ſeems to abound with Kind-
neſs, and talks of Love without Reſerve, and makes
nothing of allowing himſelf in the Liberty of kiſſing
me, which he calls innocent; but which I do not
like, and eſpecially in the manner he does it : but
for a Maſter to do it at all to a Servant, has Mean-
ing too much in it, not to alarm an honeſt Body.

I Find I am watched and ſuſpected ſtill very cloſe:
and I wiſh I was with you; but that muſt not be,

I doubt. -
My Maſter juſt now ſent for me down to take a

way his Arm about my Waiſt, and ſaid abundafice
of fond Things to me, enough to make me proud, if
his Deſign had not been apparent. After walking
about, he led me into a little Alcove, on the further
Part of the Garden; and really made me afraid of
myſelf. For he began to be very tiezing, and made
me ſit on his Knee, and was ſo often kiſſing me,
that I ſaid, Sir, I don’t like to be here at all, I aſſure
you. Indeed you make me afraid!—And what made
me the more ſo, was what he once ſaid to Mrs.
jewkes, and did not think I heard him, and which,
tho' always uppermoſt with me, I did not mention
before, becauſe I did not know how to bring it in,
in my Writing. -- -
She, I ſuppoſe, had been encouraging him in his
Wickedneſs; for it was before the laſt dreadful Trial;
and I only heard what he anſwer'd.
Said he, I will try once more; but I have begun
wrong. For I ſee Terror does but add to her Froſt;
but ſhe is a charming Girl, and may be thaw'd by
Kindneſs; and I ſhould have melted her by Love,
inſtead of freezing her by Fear. **

be ſure, I bluſh while I write it. But I truſt,
that that God who has deliver'd me from the Paw
of the Lion and the Bear; that is, his and Mrs.
jewkes's Violences; will alſo deliver me from this:
Philiſtine, myſelf, and my own Infirmities, that
% may not defy the Commands of the Living
od / e
But, as I was ſaying, this Expreſſion coming into
my Thoughts, I was of Opinion, I could not be too
much on my Guard, at all times; more eſpecially
when he took ſuch Liberties: For he profeſſed Ho-
nour all the Time with his Mouth, while his A&tions
jid not correſpond... I begg’d and pray’d he would
let me go: And had I not appear'd quite regardleſs

help it, I know not how far he would have pro-
ceeded: For I was forced to fall down upon my
Knees. - -- - - - * *
At laſt he walk’d out with me, ſtill bragging of
his Honour, and his Love. Yes, yes, Sir, ſaid I,
your Honour is to deſtroy mine; and your Love is
to ruin me, I ſee it too plainly, But, indeed, I will
not walk with you, Sir, ſaid I, any more. Do
you know, ſaid he, whom you talk to, and where
you are : - - - -
You may believe I had Reaſon to think him not
ſo decent as he ſhould be; for I ſaid, As to where
I am, Sir, I know it too well, and that I have no
Creature to befriend me: And, as to who you are,
Sir, let me aſk you, what you would have me
anſwer f. . .
Why tell me, ſaid he, What Anſwer you would
make? It will only make you angry, ſaid I; and ſo
I ſhall fare worſe, if poſſible. I won’t be angry,
ſaid he. Why then, Sir, ſaid I, you cannot be my
late good Lady’s Son; for ſhe lov’d me, and taught
me Virtue. You cannot then be my Maſter; for no
Maſter demeans himſelf ſo to his poor Servant. -
. He put his Arm round me, and his other Hand
on my Neck; which made me more angry and
bold; and he ſaid, What then am I? Why, ſaid I,
(ſtruggling from him, and in a great Paſſion) to be
ſure you are Lucifer himſelf in the Shape of my .
Maſter, or you could not uſe me thus. Theſe are
too great Liberties, ſaid he, in Anger, and I deſire
that you will not repeat them, for your own ſake:
For if you have no Decency towards me, I’ll have
none to you.
I was running from him; and he ſaid, Come back,
when I bid you.-So, knowing every Place was
alike dangerous to me, and I had nobody to run to,

faid, Pray, Sir, forgive me. No, ſaid he, rather
ſay, Pray, Lucifer, forgive me; and now, ſince
you take me for the Devil, how can you expect any
Good from me?--How, rather, can you expect any
thing but the worſt Treatment from me?---You
have given me a Charaćter, Pamela, and blame me
not that I ačt up to it. * -
Sir, ſaid I, let me beg you to forgive me. I am
really ſorry for my Boldneſs ; but indeed you don’t
uſe me like a Gentleman; and how can I expreſs my
Reſentment, if I mince the Matter, while you are
ſo indecent
Preciſe Fool ſaid he, what Indecencies have I
offer'd you?---I was bewitch'd I had not gone thro'
my Purpoſe laſt Sunday Night; and then your licen-
tious Tongue had not given the worſt Napmetolittle

Hand, and toſſing it from him, and learn another
Condućt, and more Wit; and I will lay aſide my
fooliſh Regard for you, and aſſert myſelf. Begone,
ſaid he, again, with a haughty Air. . * tº

You creep by little and little upon me; and now
ſooth me, and now threaten me; and if I ſhould for-
bear to ſhew my Reſentment, when you offer In-
civilities to me, would not that be to be loſt by
degrees? Would it not ſhew, that I could bear any
thing from you, if I did not expreſs all the Indig-
nation I could expreſs, at the firſt Approaches you
make to what I dread? And, have you not as good

How then, Sir, can I act, but by ſhewing my Ab-

can theſe Words be other than ſuch ſtrong ones, as
ſhall ſhew the Deteſtation, which, from the Bottom
of my Heart, I have for every Attempt upon my
Virtue Judge for me, Sir, and pardon me.
Pardon you ! ſaid he, what! when you don’t re-
pent?---When you have the Boldneſs to juſtify
yourſelf in your Fault? Why don’t you ſay, you
never will again offend me? I will endeavour,
Sir, ſaid I, always to preſerve that Decency towards
you which becomes me. But really, Sir, I muſt
beg your Excuſe for ſaying, That when you forget
what belongs to Decency in your A&tions, and when
Words are all that are left me, to ſhew my Re-
ſentment of ſuch A&tions, I will not promiſe to for-
bear the ſtrongeſt Expreſſions that my diſtreſſed.Mind

deter me, when my Honeſty is in Queſtion. . . .
What then, ſaid he, do you beg Pardon for?
Where is the Promiſe of Amendment, for which I
ſhould forgive you? Indeed, Sir, ſaid I, I own that

I will bear anything you can inflićt upon me with
Patience, even to the laying down of my Life, to

he walk’d by the Side of me ſome Yards, without

I F, my dear Parents, I am not deſtin'd more
ſurely than ever for Ruin, I have now, more
Comfort before me, than ever I yet knew: Andam
either nearer my Happineſs, or my Miſery, than ever
I was. God protect me from the latter, if it be his
bleſſed Will! I have now ſuch a Scence to open to
you, that I know will alarm both your Hopes and
your Fears, as it does mine. And this it is:
After my Maſter had din'd, he took a Turn into
the Stables, to look at his Stud of Horſes; and,
when he came in, he open'd the Parlour-door,
where Mrs. jewkes and I ſat at Dinner; and, at his
Entrance, we both roſe up; but he ſaid, Sit ſtill, fit
ſtill; and let me ſee how you eat your Vićtuals, Pa-
mela. O, ſaid Mrs. jewkes, very poorly, Sir, I’ll
aſſure you. No, ſaid I, pretty well, Sir, conſidering.
Noneof your Conſiderings! ſaid he, Pretty-face; and
tapp'd me on the Cheek. I bluſh'd, but was glad he
was ſo good-humour’d; but I could not tell how to
fit before him, nor to behave myſelf. So he ſaid,
I know, Pamela, you are a nice Carver: My Mo-
ther uſed to ſay ſo. My Lady, Sir, ſaid I, was very
good to me, in every thing, and would always make
me do the Honours of her Table for her, when ſhe
was with her few ſelect Friends that ſhe lov’d. Cut
up, ſaid he, that Chicken. I did ſo. Now, ſaid he,
and took a Knife and Fork, and put a Wing upon
my Plate, let me ſee you eat that. O Sir, ſaid I,"
I have eat a whole Breaſt of a Chicken already, and
cannot eat ſo much. But he ſaid, I muſt eat it for
his ſake, and he would learn me to eat heartily: So
I did eat it; but was much confuſed at his ſo kind
and unuſual Freedom and Condeſcenſion. And,

good Sirst you can’t imagine how Mrs. Žewkes
look'd, and ſtar'd, and how reſpectful ſhe ſeem'd to
me, and call'd me good A4adam, I’ll aſſure you!
urging me to take a little Bit of Tart. . . .
My Maſter took two or three Turns about the
Room, muſing and thoughtful, as I had never be-
fore ſeen him; and at laſt he went out, ſaying, I
am going into the Garden: You know, Pamela,
what I ſaid to you before Dinner. I roſe and
curt’ſy’d, ſaying, I would attend his Honour; and
he ſaid, Do, good Girl! ; : * ~ *
Well, ſaid Mrs. Jewkes, I ſee how things will go.
O Madam, as ſhe call'd me again, I am ſure you are
to be our Miſtreſs! And then I know what will be-
come of me. Ah! Mrs. Jewkes, ſaid I, if I can but
keep myſelf virtuous, ’tis the moſt of my Ambition;
and, I hope, no Temptation ſhall make me other-
wiſe. . . . . . - *
Nothwithſtanding I had no Reaſon to be pleas'd
with his Treatment of me before Dinner, yet I made
haſte to attend him; and I found him walking by the
Side of that Pond, which, for want of Grace, and
thro' a ſinful Deſpondence, had like to have been ſo
fatal to me, and the Sight of which, ever ſince, has
been a Trouble and Reproach to me... And it was
by the Side of this Pond, and not far from the Place
where I had that dreadful Conflićt, that my preſent
Hopes, if I am not to be deceiv'd again, began to
dawn; which I preſume to flatter myſelf with being
an happy Omen for me, as if God Almighty would
thew your poor ſinful Daughter, how well I did, to
put my Affiance in his Goodneſs, and not to throw
away myſelf, becauſe my Ruin ſeem’d inevitable to
my ſhort-fighted Apprehenſion. . . .
So he was pleaſed to ſay, Well, Pamela, I am
glad you are come of your own Accord, as I may
ſay: Give me your Hand, I did ſo; and he look’d at
me

at laſt ſaid, I will now talk to you in a ſerious
manner. -º - ". . . . - . ſº º 'º --> *
You have a great deal of Wit, a great deal of
Penetration, much beyond your ºars; and, as I
thought, your Opportunities. You are poſſeſſed of
an open, frank and generous Mind; and a Perſon ſo
lovely, that you excel all your Sex, in my Eyes. All
theſe Accompliſhments haveengag’dmy Affeations ſo
deeply, that as I have often ſaid, I cannot live with-
out you; and I would divide, with all my Soul, my
Fſtate with you, to make you mine upon my own
Terms. Theſe you have abſolutely reječted ; and
that, tho’ in ſaucy Terms enough, yet, in ſuch a
manner, as makes me admire you more. Your
§. Chit-chat to Mrs, jewkes, the laſt Sunday
ight, ſo innocent, and ſo full of beautiful Simpli-
city, halfdiſarmed my Reſolutions before Iapproach'd
your Bed. And I ſee you ſo watchful over your Vir-
tue, that, tho’ I hop'd to find it otherwiſe, I cannot
but ſay, my Paſſion for you is increas'd by it. But
| now what ſhall I ſay further, Pamela P– I will
makeyou, tho' a Party, my Adviſer in this Matter;
| tho' not perhaps my definitive Judge. " 'º'; .
You know I am notavery abandon'd Profligate:
I have hitherto been guilty of no very enormous or
* vile Aëtions. This of ſeizing you, and confining
* you thus, may, perhaps, be one of the worſt, .
* - leaſt to Perſons of real Innocence. Had I been
utterly given up to my Paſſions, I ſhould before
now have gratify’d them, and not have ſhewn that
Remorſe and Compaſſion for you, which have
º repriev'd you more than once, when abſolutely in
º my Power; and you are as inviolate a Virgin as you
were when you came into my Houſe. - - -

Condition. I cannot endure the Thought of Mar-

riage, even with a Perſon of equal or ſuperior
Degree to myſelf; and have declin'd ſeveral Pro-
poſals of that kind: How then, with the Diſtance
between us, and in the World's Judgment, can I
think of making you my Wife?---Yet Imuſt have
you; I cannot bear the Thoughts of any other Man
ſupplanting me in your Affe&tions. And the very
Apprehenſion of that has made me hate the Name
of Williams, and uſe him in a manner unworthy of
my Temper. - ~
Now, Pamela, judge for me; and, ſince I have
told you thus candidly my Mind, and I ſee yours is
big with ſome important Meaning, by your Eyes,
your Bluſhes, and that ſweet Confuſion which Ibe-
hold ſtruggling in your Boſom, tell me with like
Openneſs and Candour, what you think I ought to -
do, and what you would have me do.--- " . .
It is impoſſible for me to expreſs the Agitations
of my Mind on this unexpe&ted Declaration, ſo con-
trary to his former Behaviour. His Manner, too, had
ſomething ſo noble, and ſo ſincere, as I . 5.
that, alas for me! I found I had Need of all my
poor Diſcretion, to ward off the Blow which this
Treatment gave to my moſt guarded Thoughts. I
threw myſelf at his Feet; for I trembled, and could
hardly ſtand: O Sir, ſaid I, ſpare your poor Servant's
Confuſion! O ſpare the poor Pamela 1---Speak out,
ſaid he, and tell me what I bid you, What you
think I ought to do? I cannot ſay what you ought
to do, anſwer'd I : But I only beg you will not
ruin me; and, if you think me virtuous, if you
think me ſincerely honeſt, let me go to my poor
Parents. I will vow to you, that I will never ſuffer
myſelf to be engag'd without your Approbation.
Still he inſiſted upon a more explicit Anſwer to
his Queſtion, of what I thought he ought to do.
And l ſaid, As to my poor Thoughts, of what à.

ought to do, I muſt needs ſay, that, indeed, I
think you ought to regard the World's Opinion,
and avoid doing any thing diſgraceful to your Birth
and Fortune; and therefore, if you really honour
the poor Pamela with your Reſpect, a little Time,
Abſence, and the Converſation of worthier Perſons
of my Sex, will effectually enable you to overcome
a Regard ſo unworthy of your Condition: And this,
good Sir, is the beſt Advice I can offer.
Charming Creature! lovely Pamela / ſaid he, (with
an Ardor, that was never before ſo agreeable to me)
this generous Manner is of a Piece with all the reſt
of your Condućt. But tell me ſtill more explicitly,
what you would adviſe me to in the Caſe.
O'Sir, ſaid I, take not Advantage of my Credulity,
and theſe my weak Moments; but, were I the firſt
Lady in the Land, inſtead of the poor abjećt Pa-
mela, I would, I could tell you. But I can ſay no

O my dear Father and Mother! now I know you

for myſelf:—And now I begin to be afraid, I know
too well the Reaſon, 'why all his hard Trials of me,
and my black Apprehenſions, would not let me hate
him. . . . .
But be aſſur’d ſtill, by God's Grace, that I ſhall
do nothing unworthy of your Pamela; and if I find
that he is ſtill capable of deceiving me, and that this
Condućt is only put on to delude me more, I ſhall
think nothing in this World ſo vile and ſo odious; and
nothing, if he be not the worſt of his Kind, (as he
ſays, and, I hope, he is not) ſo deſperately guileful
as the Heart of Man. -
He generouſly ſaid, I will ſpare your Confuſion,
Pamela. But fº, I may promiſe myſelf, that
you can love me preferably to any other Man; and
that no one in the World has had any Share in your
Affections ;

Affections; for I am very jealous of what I love,
and if I thought 3. had a ſecret Whiſpering in
your Soul, that had not yet come up to a Wiſh, for
any other Man breathing, I ſhould not forgive my-
ſelf to perfiſt in my Affection for you; nor you, if
you did not frankly acquaint me with it. -
As I ſtill continued on my Knees, on the Graſs
Slope by the Pond-fide, he ſat himſelf down on the
Graſs by me, and took me in his Arms, Why he-
ſitates my Pamela, ſaid he * – Can you not anſwer
me with Truth, as I wiſh 2 If you cannot, ſpeak,
and I will forgive you." .
O, good Sir, ſaid I, it is not that ; indeed it is
* not: But a frightful Word, or two that you
ſaid to Mrs. Jewkes, when you thought I was not in
hearing, comes croſs my Mind; and makes mc
dread, that I am in more Danger than ever I was in
my Life. . .
You have never found me a common Liar, ſaid
he, (too fearful and fooliſh Pamela 1) nor will
I anſwer, how long I may hold in my preſent
Mind ; for my Pride ſtruggles hard within me,
Pll aſſure you; and if you doubt me, I have no
Obligation to your Confidence or Opinion. But at
preſent, I am really ſincere in what I ſay: And I
expet you will be ſo too ; and anſwer direétly my
“Queſtion.

Queſtion is of ſuch a Nature, that I only want to

fineſt Lady in England.
O Sir, ſaid I, my Virtue is as dear to me, as if I
was of the higheſt Quality; and my Doubts (for
which you know I have had too much Reaſon) have
made me troubleſome. But now, Sir, I will tell
you what I heard, which has given me great Un-
eaſineſs.
You talked to Mrs. Žewkes of having begun wrong
with me, in trying to ſubdue me with #. and of
Froſt, and ſuch-like;— you remember it well:—and
that you would, for the future, change your Con-
dućt, and try to melt me, that was your Word, by
Kindneſs.
I fear not, Sir, the Grace of God ſupporting me,
‘that any A&s of Kindneſs would make me forget
what I owe to my Virtue; but, Sir, I may, I find,
be made more miſerable by ſuch Aćts, than by Ter-
ror; becauſe my Nature is too. frank and open to
make me wiſh to be ingrateful; and if I ſhould be
taught a Leſſon I never yet learnt, with what Re-
gret ſhould I deſcend to the Grave, to think, that I
could not hate my Undoer? And, that, at the laſt
great Day, I muſt ſtand up as an Accuſer of the poor
Fºrpſ Soul, that I could wiſh it in my Power to

given me a Hint that will hold melong. But, ſweet
Creature, ſaid he, tell me what is this Leſſon, which
3. neveryet learnt, and which you are ſo afraid of
learning? - ... . .
If, Sir, ſaid I, you will again generouſly ſpare my
‘Confuſion, I need not ſay it: . But this I will ſay, in

of with ſuch a Hope. I had brought my Mind ſo
to love Poverty, that I hop'd for nothing but to .
return to the beſt, tho’ the pooreſt, of Parents; and
to employ myſelf in ſerving God, and comforting .
them; and you know not, Sir, how you diſap-
pointed my Hopes, and my propoſed honeſt Plea- -
ſures, when you ſent me hither.
Well then, ſaid he, I may promiſe myſelf, that
neither the Parſon, nor any other Man, is any the
leaſt ſecret Motive to your ſtedfaſt Refuſal of my
Offers? Indeed, Sir, ſaid I, you may; and, as you
was pleaſed to ask, I anſwer, that I have not the leaſt
Shadow of a Wiſh, or Thought, for any Man
living. -
But, ſaid he; for I am fooliſhly jealous, and yet it :
ſhews my Fondneſs for you ; have you not en- -
courag’d Williams to think you will have him? In- -
deed, Sir, ſaid I, I have not; but the very contrary.
And would you not have had him, ſaid he, if you
had got away by his Means? I had reſolv’d, Sir,
ſaid I, in my Mind otherwiſe; and he knew it, and
the poor Man-- I charge you, ſaid he, ſay not a
Word in his Favour ! You will excite a Whirlwind
in my Soul, if you name him with Kindneſs, and
then you'll be borne away with the Tempeſt.

not have done; let me know the whole. If you
have any Regard for him, ſpeak out; for, it would
end fearfully for you, for me, and for him, if I
found, that you diſguis'd any Secret of your Soul
from me, in this nice Particular.

convinc'd that you are not prepoſſeſs'd, my Vanity
makes me aſſur’d, that I need not to fear, a Place in
your Eſteem, equal, if not preferable to any Man
in England. But yet it ſtings my Pride to the quick,
that you was ſo eaſily brought, and at ſuch a ſhort
Acquaintance, to run away with that College No-
Vice :
*O good 'Sir, ſaid I, may I be heard one Thing,
and tho’ I bring upon me your higheſt Indignation,
‘I will tell you, perhaps the unneceſſary and impru-
dent, but yet, the whole.Truth. -
My Honeſty (I am poor and lowly, and am not
'intitled to call it Honour), was in Danger. I ſaw
'no Means of ſecurin myſelf from your avow’d At-
tempts. You had ſhew'd you would not ſtick at
"little Matters; and what, Sir, could any body have
thought of my Sincerity, in preferring that to all
other Conſiderations, if I had not eſcap'd from
theſe Dangers, if I could have found any way for
it?– I am not going to ſay any thing for him;
but indeed, indeed, Sir, I was the Cauſe of putting
him upon aſſiſting me in my Eſcape. I got him
to acquaint me, what Gentry there were in the
Neighbourhood, that I might fly to; and prevail'd
* upon him ; – Don't frown at me, good Sir, for
I muſt tell you the whole Truth ! — to apply to
‘ene Lady jones ; to Lady Darnford; and º: Was
‘ſo good to apply to Mr. Peters the Miniſter: but
* they all refus'd me; and then it was he let me know,
“that there was no honourable Way but Mºjº:

.
That I declin'd; and he agreed to aſſiſt me for
God’s ſake. . . . " -
Now, ſaid he, you are going-I boldly put
Hand before his Mouth, hardly knowing i. i.
I took; Pray, Sir, ſaid I, don't be angry; I have
juſt done—I would only ſay, That rather than have
ſtaid to be ruin'd, I would have thrown myſelf upon
the pooreſt Beggar that ever the World ſaw, if I
thought him honeſt.— And I hope, when you duly
weigh all Matters, you will forgive me, and not
think me ſo bold and ſo forward as you have been
pleas'd to call me.
Well, ſaid he, even in this your laſt Speech, which,
let me tell you, ſhews more your Honeſty of Heart,
than your Prudence, you have not overmuch pleas'd
me. But I muſt love you; and that vexes me not
a little. But tell me, Pamela ; for now the former
Queſtion recurs;:Since you ſo much prize your Ho-
nour and your Virtue; ſince all Attempts againſt
that are ſo odious to ?: and, ſince I have avow-
edly made ſeveral of theſe Attempts, do you think
it is poſſible for you to love me preferably to any
other of my Sex?
Ah! Sir, ſaid I, and here my Doubt recurs,
that you may thus graciouſly uſe me, to take Advan-
tage of my Credulity.
Still perverſe and doubting, ſaid hel Cannot you
take me as I am at preſent; and that, I have told
you, is ſincere and undeſigning, whatever I may
be hereafter P --
Ah! Sir, reply'd I, what can I ſay? - I have
already ſaid too much, if this dreadful Hereafter
fhould take place. Don't bid me ſay how well I
can — And then, my Face, glowing as the Fire, I,
all abaſh'd, lean'd upon his Shoulder, to hide my
‘Confuſion,
He

<page 337>
294 P4M E L 4: Or,
... He claſp'd metohim with great Ardour, and ſaid,
Hide your dear Face in my Boſom, my beloved
Pamela; your innocent Freedoms charm me!—But
then ſay, How well--what? . . . . ." .
* If you will be good, ſaid I, to your poor Servant,
and ſpare her, I cannot ſay too much! But if not,
I am doubly undone! – Undone indeed!
Said he, f hope my preſent Temper will hold;
for I tell you frankly, that I have known in this
agreeable Hour more fincere Pleaſure, than I have
experienc'd in all the guilty Tumults that my deſiring
‘Soul put me into, in the ... poſſeſſing you on
my own Terms. And, Pamela, you muſt pray for the
Continuance of this Temper; and I hope your
Prayers will get the better of my Temptations.
This ſweet Goodneſs overpower'd all my Reſerves.
I threw myſelf at his Feet, and embrac'd his Knees:
What Pleaſure, Sir, you give me, at theſe gracious
Words, is not lent your poor Servant to §.
I ſhall be too much rewarded for all my Sufferings,
if this Goodneſs hold! God grant it may, for your
“own Soul's ſake, as well as mine. And Oh! how
happy ſhould I be, if– . . . . -
#. ſtopt me, and ſaid, But, my dear Girl, what
muſt we do about the World, and the World's Cen-
... ſure ?–Indeed, I cannot marry! .
Now was I again ſtruck all of a Heap. However,
ſoon recolle&ting myſelf, Sir, ſaid I, I have not the
Preſumption to hope ſuch an Honour. If I may be
ermitted to return in Peace and Safety to my poor
Parents, to pray for you there; it is all I at preſent
requeſt This, Sir, after all my Apprehenſions and
Dangers, will be a great Pleaſure to me. And, if I
know my own poor Heart, I ſhall wiſh you happy
in a Lady of ſuitable Degree: And rejoice moſt
ſincerely in every Circumſtance that ſhall make for

the Happineſs of my late good Lady's moſt be-
loved Sön -- - - - . . .
Well, ſaid he, this Converſation, Pamela, is gone
farther than I intended it. You need not be afraid,
at this rate, of truſting yourſelf with me : But it is
I, that ought to be doubtful of myſelf, when I am
with you. — But, before I ſay any thing further on
this Subjećt, I will take my proud Heart to Task;
and, till then, let every **, be, as if this, Con-
nly, let me tell you,
that the more Confidence you place in me, the
more you’ll oblige me: But your Doubts will only
beget Cauſe of Doubts. And with this ambiguous
Saying, he ſaluted me in a more formal manner, if
I may ſo ſay, than before, and lent me his Hand,
and ſo we walk'd towards the Houſe, Side-by-ſide,
he ſeeming very thoughtful and penſive, as if he had
already repented him of his Goodneſs.
What ſhall I do, what Steps take, if all this
be deſigning! — O the Perplexities of theſe eruel
Doubtings!—To be ſure, if he be falſe, as I may
call it, I have gone too far, much too far ! - I am
ready, on the Apprehenſion of this, to bite my for-
ward Tongue, (or rather to beat my more forward
Heart, that dićtated to that poor Machine) for what
I have ſaid. But ſure, at leaſt, he muſt be ſincere
for the Time ! — He could not be ſuch a pračtiſed
Diſſembler | – If he could, O how deſperately
wicked is the Heart of Man!— And where could
he learn all theſe barbarous Arts? — If ſo, it muſt
be native ſurely to the Sex!— But, ſilent be my
raſh Cenſurings; be huſh'd, ye ſtormy Tumults of
my diſturbed Mind; for have I not a Father who is
a Man!—A Man who knows no Guile! who would
do no Wrong! - who would not deceive or oppreſs
to

native to the Sex?, And I muſt alſº hope my good
Lady's Son cannot be the worſt of Men! — } he is,
hard the Lot of the excellent Woman that bore him
-- But much harder the Hap of your poor Pamela,
who has fallen into ſuch Hands! — But yet I will
truſt in God, and hope the beſt; and ſo lay down
my tired Pen for this Time.
