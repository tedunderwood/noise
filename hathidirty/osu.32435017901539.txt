to every enlightened quarter of the univerſe!

PREFACE,

<page 12>
P. R. E. F. A. C. E.
SELECTION of the Beauties of Sterne is
A what has been looked for by a number of
his admirers for ſome time; well knowing they
would form ſuch a Volume as perhaps this,
nor any other language, could equal. Indeed
it was highly neceſſary on a particular ſcore to
make this ſelection : the chaſe lovers of litera-
ture were not only deprived themſelves of the
pleaſure and inſtruction ſo conſpicuous in this
magnificent aſſemblage of Genius, but their riſing
offspring, whoſe minds it would poliſh to the
higheſt perfection were prevented from taſting
the enjoyment likewiſe. The chaſe part of the
world complained ſo loudly of the obſcenity
which taints the writings of Sterne, (and, in-
deed, with ſome reaſon), that thoſe readers un-
der their immediate inſpection were not ſuffered
to penetrate beyond the title-page of his Triºram
Shandy;—his Sentimental journey, in ſome de-
gree, eſcaped the general cenſure ; though that
is not entirely free of the fault complained of.

-
To accommodate thoſe who are ſtrangers to
the firſt of theſe works, I have, (I hope with
ſome degree of judgment), extracted the moſt
diſtinguiſhed paſſages on which the ſun of Genius
ſhines ſo reſplendent, that all his competitors,
in his manner of writing, are loſt in an eclipſe
of affectation and unnatural rhapſody. I intended
to have arranged them alphabetically, till I found
the ſtories of Le Fever, the Aſonk, and Alaria,
would be too cloſely connected for the feeling
reader, and would wound the boſom of ſenſibility
too deeply: I therefore placed them at a proper
diſtance from each other.—I need not explain
my motive for introducing the Sermon on the
abuſes of Conſcience, with the effuſions of hu-
manity throughout it ; every parent and gover-
nor, I believe, (unleſs a bigotted Papiſt), will
thank me.—I wiſh I could infuſe the pleaſure
that attended me in compiling this little work,
into the breaſt of the reader, yet unacquainted
with Sterne—as it is, I promiſe him, the hours
he may devote to this great maſter of nature
and the paſſions, will be marked with more fe-
licity, than any, ſince genius led him to the love
of letters, \
The Author's opinion of many parts of the
ſacred writings may with truth be applied to
a great

<page 14>
P R. E. F A C E. vii
a great part of his own, that there is to be
found in them, “Sublime and noble paſſages,
& 4 which, by the rules of ſound criticiſm and
“ reaſon, may be demonſtrated to be truly elo-
“ quent and beautiful.
“ There is ſomething in them ſo thoroughly
4.
{
affecting, and ſo noble and ſublime withal,
4
{
that one might challenge the writings of the
“ moſt celebrated orators of antiquity to pro-
&
G
duce any thing like them.”
Before I conclude, I cannot help obſerving
with an excellent writer, that, “ there are
“minds upon which the rays of fancy may be
“ pointed without effect, and which no fire of
“ſentiment can agitate, or exalt.”—May ſuch
minds never violate the Beauties of Sterne; but
let them be, while the virtues find ſanétuary in
the hearts of the amiable—their amuſement
only. º

HE readers of this and the former editions
will perceive the publiſher not behind hand
in the gratitude he owes them:-he has added
to this edition above forty pages of new mat-
ter, which will be found equally worthy of their
patronage and attention. Senſible, at the ſame
time, how pleaſing it would be to the lovers of
fine writing to have a well engraved likeneſs of
ſuch an illuſtrious promoter of virtue, humanity,
and that rapturous amuſement that is ever en-
tertaining and ever new, he has procured one from
the hand of that ingenious artiſt, Mr. Trotter,
which he believes will give general ſatisfaction.
—The few errors in this edition, which aroſe
principally from the avidity of the public, whoſe
demands preſſed ſo hard upon the printer, that
he was obliged to produce the work in too ſhort

a ſpace of time, it is hoped will be overlooked
by the reader. This favour obtained, he has not
a doubt remaining but this ſelection will place
his gratitude for the countenance with which his
readers have honoured him, in the moſt pleaſing
and conſpicuous point of view : and that it will,
every hour, like the returning light of Heaven,
diſpel the miſts of error and inſenſibility from
the ſoul, and illume the glorious proſpect of
virtue and humanity to be the chief admiration
of mankind.

HE Author of the annexed pages of ſuper-
lative genius was born at Clonmel in the
ſouth of Ireland, November the 24th, 1713; his
father was a lieutenant in Hamdafide’s regiment,
and grandſon to Dr. Richard Sterne, Archbiſhop
of York, who died in 1683. Our Author was
born a few days after his father and mother's
arrival from Dunkirk.-His birth-day, he tells
us, “was ominous to his poor father, who was,
the day after his arrival, with many other brave
officers broke, and ſent adrift into the wide
world with a wife and two children.” On his
father’s being diſbanded he removed to his fa-

mily ſeat at Elvington, near York, where his mo-
ther reſided. Here they ſojourned for ten months,
when the regiment was cºſtabliſhed, and they all
repaired to Dublin–Within a month of their
arrival, his father was ordered to Exeter, to
which place they all followed him. In about a
year after we find them in Dublin again. Here
his father ſeemed to entertain ſome hopes of re-
ſiding ſome time, for he took a large houſe, fur-
niſhed it, and in a year and half’s time ſpent a
great deal of noney.
In 1719 the regiment was ordered, with many
others, to the Iſle of Hight, in order to embark
for Spain in the Jigo expedition. Our Author's
mother, ſiſter, and himſelf, remained at the Iſle
of Hight during the ſigo expedition, and until
the regiment had got back to Wicklow in Ireland,
from whence his father ſent for them. They
embarked for Dublin, and had all been caſt away
by a moſt violent ſtorm ; but through the inter-
ceſſions of his mother, the captain was prevailed
upon to turn back into Wales, where they ſtayed
a month, and at length got into Dublin, and
travelled by land to Wicklow, where his father
had for ſome wccks given them over for loſt.
They lived in the barracks at Wicklow, one year,

(one thouſand ſeven hundred and twenty) from
thence they decamped to ſtay half a year with
Mr. Fetherſtone, a clergyman, about ſeven miles
from Wicklow, who being a relation of Mrs.
Sterne’s, invited them to his parſonage at Animo.
—It was in this pariſh during their ſtay, that
our author had that wonderful eſcape in falling
through a mill-race whilſt the mill was going,
and of being taken up unhurt—the ſtory is in-
credible, but known for truth in all that part of
Ireland—where hundreds of the common people
flocked to ſee him.—From hence they followed
the regiment to Dublin, where they lay in the
barracks a year: in which year, 1721, our author
learned to write, &c.—The next year the regi-
ment was ordered to Carrickfergus, in the north
of Ireland ; but when they arrived at Drogheda,
in their route, they were ordered to AMullingar,
where by Providence they ſtumbled upon a kind
relation, a collateral deſcendant from Archbiſhop
Sterne, who took them all to his caſtle, and enter-
tained them with cordial hoſpitality for a year
—and ſent them to the regiment at Carrickfer-
guy, loaded with kindneſſes. Some ſhort time
after our author's father got leave of his Colonel
to fix him at ſchool—which he did near Hallifax,
in Yorkſhire, with an able maſter; with whom

º
he ſtaid ſome time, till by God’s care of him his
couſin Sterne, of Elvington, became a father to
him, and ſent him to the univerſity, &c.
Our Author remained at Hallifax till about the
latter end of the year 1731. Here he takes oc-
caſion to mention the following ancedote of him-
ſelf, and ſchoolmaſter “The ceiling of the
“ ſchool-room was new white-waſhed—--the
“ladder remained there—I one unlucky day
“ mounted it, and wrote with a bruſh in large
“ capital letters, LAUR. STERNE, for which
“ the uſher ſeverely whipped me. My maſter
“ was much hurt at this, and ſaid, before me,
“ that never ſhould that name be effaced, for I
“ was a boy of genius, and he was ſure I ſhould
“ come to preferment—this expreſſion made
“ me forget the ſtripes I had received.”
In the year 1732 his couſin ſent him to the
univerſity. He was admitted of jeſus College,
in the univerſity of Cambridge, 6th of July, 1733,
under the tuition of Mr. Cannon.—Matriculated
29th March, 1735. Admitted to the degree of
B. A. in Žanuary, 1736–M. A. at the com-
mencement, 1740.-From the univerſity he re-
moved to York. His uncle 7aques Sterne, LL.D.
- who

<page 30>

who was prependary of Durham, &c. &c. &c, got
him the living of Sutton. At York he became
acquainted with Mrs. Sterne, who thought her-
ſelf at that time not rich enough, or our author
too poor to agree to a union. Some time
after, ſhe fell into a conſumption—and one even-
ing when he was ſitting by her with an almoſt
broken heart, ſhe ſaid, “My dear Lawry, I
-can never be yours, for I verily believe I have
not long to live—but I have left you every ſhil-
ling of my fortune;”—upon that ſhe ſhewed him
her will—which generoſity, he ſays, overpower-
ed him. -
She recovered, and they were married 1741.
His uncle got him the prebendary of York ;
and through his wife’s intercft he got the living
of stillington. He reſided at Sutton near twenty
years, doing duty at both places.
In the year 1760, he took a houſe at York,
and immediately after came to London to pub-
liſh his two firſt volumes of Shandy: which vo-
lumes were publiſhed the year before at York.
In 1760 Lord Falconbridge preſented him with
the curacy of Coxwould. In 1762 he went to
Iºrance, and his ſuily followed him. In two

years after he went tº Italy for the recovery of
his health, and returned in May 1766.-He left
York about the latter end of the year 1767, and
came to London to publiſh the Sentimental 7our-
mey, which he had written the ſummer before
at his favourite living of Coxworld. His health
had been for ſome time declining, but he con-
tinued to viſit his friends, and retained his wont-
ed flow of ſpirits. In February, 1768, he per-
ceived the approaches of death, and after a ſhort
ſtruggle with his diſorder, his debilitated and
worn out frame ſubmitted to fate on the 18th
day of March 1768, at his lodgings in Bond-

and Yorick, to take this young creature out of theſe
women’s hands, and put him into thoſe of a pri-
vate governor.
Now as I conſider the perſon who is to be
about my ſon, as the mirror in which he is to
view himſelf from morning to night, and by which
he is to adjuſt his looks, his carriage, and perhaps
the inmoſt ſentiments of his heart ; –I would have
one, Yorick, if poſſible, poliſhed at all points, fit
for my child to look into.
There is, continued my father, a certain mien
and motion of the body and all its parts, both in
acting and ſpeaking, which argues a ma well

continued my father, which let a penetrating eye
at once into a man’s ſoul; and I maintain it, add-
ed he, that a man of ſenſe does not lay down his
hat in coming into a room, or take it up in go-
ing out of it, but ſomething eſcapes, which diſ-
covers him.
I will have him, continued my father, cheerful,

quick in reſolving doubts and ſpeculative queſtions;

cried my uncle Toby, free, and generous, and

uncle Toby, raiſing himſelf off the chair, and lay-

T was ſome time in the ſummer of that year in
which Dendermond was taken by the Allies;
when my uncle Toby was one evening getting his
ſupper, with Trim ſitting behind him at a ſmall
ſideboard,—I ſay fitting—for in conſideration of
the Corporal’s lame knee (which ſometimes gave
him exquiſite pain)—when my uncle Toby dined
or ſupped alone, he would never ſuffer the Corporal
to ſtand; and the poor fellow’s veneration for his
maſter was ſuch, that with a proper artillery, my
uncle Toby could have taken Dendermond itſelf,
with leſs trouble then he was able to gain this
point over him; for many a time when my uncle
Toby ſuppoſed the Corporal’s leg was at reſt, he
would look back, and dete&t him ſtanding behind
him with the moſt dutiful reſpect: this bred more
little ſquabbles betwixt them, than all other cauſes
for five-and-twenty years together—But this is
neither here nor there—why do I mention it?—

He was one evening ſitting thus at his ſupper,
when the landlord of a little inn in the village came
into the parlour with an empty phial in his hand,
to beg a glaſs or two of ſack; 'Tis for a poor gen-
tleman,—H think of the army, ſaid the landlord,
who has been taken ill at my houſe four days
ago, and has never held up his head ſince, or had
a deſire to taſte any thing, till juſt now, that he
has a fancy for a glaſs of ſack, and a thin toaſt,--
“I think,” ſays he, taking his hand from his fore-
head, “it would comfort me.”
—If I could neither beg, borrow, or buy ſuch a
thing, added the landlord, I would almoſt ſteal
it for the poor gentleman, he is ſo ill.—I hope in
God he will ſtill mend continued he, we are all
of us concerned for him.
Thou art a good-natured ſoul, I will anſwer for
thee, cried my uncle Toby: and thou ſhalt drink
the poor gentleman’s health in a glaſs of ſack
thyſelf-and take a couple of bottles with my
ſervice, and tell him he is heartily wereometo them,
and to a dozen more if they will do him good.
Though I am perſuaded, ſaid my uncle Toby, as
the landlord ſhut the door, he is a very compaſ.

taining a high opinion of his gueſt too; there muſt
be ſomething more than common in him, that in
ſo ſhort a time ſhould win ſo much upon the affec-
tions of his hoſts—And of his whole family, added
the Corporal, for they are all concerned for him.—
Step after him, ſaid my uncle Toby, do Trim,
and aſk if he knows his name.
—I have quite forgot it, truly, ſaid the landlord,
coming back into the parlour with the Corporal,—
but I can aſk his ſon again:—Has he a ſon with
him then? ſaid my uncle Toby.—A boy, replied
the landlord, of about eleven or twelve years of
age;—but the poor creatnre has taſted almoſt as
little as his father; he does nothing but mourn and
lament for him night and day:-He has not ſtir-
red from the bedſide theſe two days.
My uncle Toby laid down his knife and fork,
and thruſt his plate from before him as the land-
lord gave him the account; and Trim, without
being ordered, took away; without ſaying one
word, and in a few minutes after, brought him his
pipe and tobacco.
Trim! ſaid my uncle Toby, I have a projećt in
my head, as it is a bad night, of wrapping myſelf

up warm in my roquelaure, and paying a viſit to
this poor gentleman—Your honour's roquelaure,
replied the Corporal, has not once been had on,
ſince the night before your honour received your
wound, when we mounted guard in the trenches
before the gate of St. Nicholas;—and befides, it is
ſo cold and rainy a night, that what with the roque-
laure, and what with the weather, it will be enough
to give your honour your death, and bring on your
honour’s torment in your groin, I fear ſo, replied
my uncle Toby ; but I am not at reſt in my mind,
Trim, ſince the account the landlord has given me.
—I wiſh I had not known ſo much of this affair,
added my uncle Toby,+or that I had known more
of it:—How ſhall we manage it? Leave it, an’
pleaſe your honour, to me, quoth the Corporal;—
I’ll take my hat and ſtick and go to the houſe and
reconnoitre, and act accordingly; and I will bring
your honour a full account in an hour.—Thou ſhalt
go, Trim, ſaid my uncle Toby, and here’s a ſhilling
for thee to drink with his ſervant.—I ſhall get it all
out of him ſaid the Corporal, ſhutting the door.
It was not till my uncle Toby had knocked the
aſhes out of his third pipe, that Corporal Trim re-
turned from the inn, and gave him the following
a CCCuilt.
I deſpaired

<page 44>
THE BEAUTIES of STERNE. 7
I deſpaired, at firſt, ſaid the Corporal, of being
able to bring back your honour any kind of intelli-
gence concerning the poor ſick Lieutenant—Is he
in the army, then? ſaid my uncle Toby, He is,
ſaid the Corporal—And in what regiment? ſaid my
uncle Toby—I’ll tell your honour, replied the
Corporal, everything ſtraight forwards, as I learnt
it.—Then, Trim, I will fill another pipe, ſaid my
uncle Toby, and not interrupt thee till thou haſt
done; ſo fit down at thy eaſe, Trim, in the win-
dow-ſeat, and begin thy ſtory again. The Corporal
made his old bow, which generally ſpoke as plain
as a bow could ſpeak it—Your honour is good:—
And having done that, he ſat down, as he was
ordered,—and began the ſtory to my uncle Toby
over again in pretty near the ſame words.
I deſpaired at firſt, ſaid the Corporal, of being
able to bring back any intelligence to your honour,
about the Lieutenant and his ſon; for when I aſked
where his ſervant was, from whom I made myſelf
ſure of knowing every thing which was proper to
be aſked,—That’s a right diſtinction, Trim, ſaid
my uncle Toby—I was anſwered an' pleaſe your
honour, that he had no ſervant with him;-that:
he had come to the inn with hired horſes, which,
upon finding himſelf unable to proceed, (to join, I.

ſuppoſe, the regiment), he had diſmiſſed the morn-
ing after he came,—if I get better, my dear, ſaid
he, as he gave his putſe to his ſon to pay the man,
—we can hire horſes from hence.—But alas! the
poor gentleman will never get from hence, ſaid
the landlady to me, for I heard the death-watch
all night long;—and when he dies, the youth, his
fon, will certainly die with him; for he is broken-
hearted already.
I was hearing this account continued the Cor-
poral, when the youth came into the kitchen, to
order the thin toaſt the landlord ſpoke of;-but I
will do it for my father myſelf, ſaid the youth.—
Pray let me ſave you the trouble, young gentle-
man ſaid I, taking up a fork for the purpoſe, and
offering him my chair to ſit down upon by the
fire, whilſt I did it.—I believe, Sir, ſaid he, very
modeſtly, I can pleaſe him beſt myſelf—I am
ſure, ſaid I, his honour will not like the teaſt the
worſe for being toaſted by an old ſoldier.—The
youth took hold of my hand, and inſtantly burſt
into tears.-Poor youth, ſaid my uncle Toby,
he has been bred up from an infant in the army,
and the name of a ſoldier, Trim, ſounded in his
ears like the name of a friend;—I wiſh I had him.

—I never

—I never in the longeſt march, ſaid the Cor-
poral, had ſo great a mind to my dinner, as I had
to cry with him for company:-What could be
the matter with me, an” pleaſe your honour?
Nothing in the world, Trim, ſaid my uncle Toby,
blowing his noſe, but that thou art a good na-
tured fellow,
When I gave him the toaſt, continued the Cor-
poral, I thought it was proper to tell him I was
Captain Shandy’s ſervant, and that your honour
(though a ſtranger) was extremely concerned for
his father; and that if there was any thing in
your houſe or cellar—(And thou might'ſt have
added my purſe too, ſaid my uncle Toby, he
was heartily welcome to it:—He made a very low
bow, (which was meant to your honour), but no
anſwer,-for his heart was full—ſo he went up
ſtairs with the toaſt;-I warrant you, my dear,
ſaid I, as I opened the kitchen-door, your father
will be well again.—Mr. Yorick’s curate was
ſmoaking a pipe by the kitchen fire, but ſaid not
a word good or bad to comfort the youth.-I
thought it wrong; added the Corporal—I think
ſo too, ſaid my uncle Toby.
When the Lieutenant had taken his glaſs of ſack
and toaſt, he felt himſelf a little revived, and ſent

down into the kitchen, to let me know, that int
about ten minutes he ſhould be glad if I would ſtep
up ſtairs—I believe, ſaid the landlord, he is going
to ſay his prayers, for there was a book laid upon
the chair by his bed-ſide, and as I ſhut the door,
I ſaw his ſon take up a cuſhion.—
I thought, ſaid the curate, that you gentlemen
of the army, Mr. Trim, never ſaid your prayers
at all.—I heard the poor gentleman ſay his prayers
laſt night, ſaid the landlady, very devoutly, and
with my own ears, or I could not have believed
it.—Are you ſure of it, replied the curate.—A
ſoldier an” pleaſe your reverence, ſaid I, prays
as often (of his own accord) as a parſon;–and
when he is fighting for his king, and for his own
life, and for his honour too, he has the moſt
reaſon to pray to God, of any one in the whole
world,—’Twas well ſaid of thee, Trim, ſaid my
uncle Toby.—But when a ſoldier, ſaid I, an” pleaſe
your reverence, has been ſtanding for twelve
hours together in the trenches, up to his knees in
cold water,-or engaged, ſaid I, for months to-
gether in long and dangerous marches; haraſſed,
perhaps, in his rear to-day;-haraffing others to-
morrow;—detached here;—countermanded there;

in his ſhirt the next;—benumbed in his joints;
—perhaps without ſtraw in his tent to kneel on ;
—muſt ſay his prayers how and when he can.—
I believe, ſaid I,-for I was piqued, quoth the
Corporal, for the reputation of the army, I be-
lieve an” pleaſe your reverence, ſaid I, that when
a ſoldier gets time to pray,+he prays as heartily
as a parſon, though not with all his fuſs and
hypocriſy—-Thou ſhouldſt not have ſaid that,
Trim, ſaid my uncle Toby,–for God only knows
who is a hypocrite, and who is not:--At the
great and general review of us all, Corporal, at
the day of judgment, (and not till then)—it will
be ſeen who has done their duties in this world,
—and who has not; and we ſhall be advanced,
Trim, accordingly.—I hope we ſhall, ſaid Trim,
—It is in the ſcripture, ſaid my uncle Toby : and
I will ſhew it thee to-morrow :—In the mean
time we may depend upon it, Trim, for our com-
fort, ſaid my uncle Toby, that God Almighty is
ſo good and juſt a governor of the world, that if
we have but done our duties in it, it will never
be enquired into, whether we have done them in
a red coat or a black one :-I hope not ; ſaid the
Corporal—But go on, Trim, ſaid my uncle Toby,
with thy ſtory.

When I went up, continued the Corporal, into-
the Lieutenant’s room, which I did not do till the
expiration of the ten minutes—he was laying in
his bed, with his head raiſed upon his hand, with
his elbow upon the pillow, and a clean white
cambrick handkerchief beſide it :—The youth was
juſt ſtooping down to take up the cuſhion, upon
which I ſuppoſed he had been kneeling, the book
was laid upon the bed, and as he roſe, in taking
up the cuſhion with one hand, he reached out his
other to take it away at the ſame time. Let it
remain there, my dear, ſaid the Lieutenant.
He did not offer to ſpeak to me, till I had
walked up cloſe to his bed-ſide:—If you are Cap-
tain Shandy’s ſervant, ſaid he, you muſt preſent
my thanks to your maſter, with my little boy’s
thanks along with them, for his courteſy to me;
—if he was of Levens’s-ſaid the Lieutenant.—
I told him your honour was, Then, ſaid he, I
ſerved three campaigns with him in Flanders, and
remember him,--but 'tis moſt likely, as I had not
the honour of any acquaintance with him, that
he knows nothing of me.—You will tell him, how-
ever, that the perſon his good-nature has laid un-
der obligations to him, is one Le Fever, a Lieute-
nant in Angus’s-—but he knows me not,-ſaid he,

killed with a muſket ſhot, as ſhe lay in my arms
in my tent.—I remember the ſtory an” pleaſe your
honour, ſaid I, very well.—Do you ſo? ſaid he,
wiping, his eyes with his handkerchief—then
well may I.- In ſaying this, he drew a little
ring out of his boſom, which ſeemed tied with
a black ribband about his neck, and kiſs'd it
twice—Here, Billy, ſaid he, the boy flew acroſs
the room to the bed-ſide,-and falling down
upon his knee, took the ring in his hand, and kiſ.
ſed it too, then kiſſed his father, and ſat down
upon the bed and wept.

larly well that he, as well as ſhe, upon ſome account

or other, (I forget what,) was univerſally pitied by
the whole regiment;-but finiſh the ſtory thou art
upon:—'Tis finiſhed already, ſaid the Corporal,—
for I could ſtay no longer, ſo wiſhed his honour
a good night; young Le Fever roſe from off the bed,
and ſaw me to the bottom of the ſtairs; and as we
went down together, told me, they had come from
Ireland, and were on their route to join the regi-
ment in Flanders.-But alas! ſaid the Corporal,—
the Lieutenant’s laſt day's march is over.—Then
what is to become of his poor boy? cried my
uncle Toby.
It was to my uncle Toby’s eternal honour, that
he ſet aſide every other concern, and only conſi-
dered how he himſelf ſhould relieve the poor Lieu-
tenant and his ſon.
—That kind BEING, who is a friend to the
friendleſs, ſhall recompence thee for this.

Toby, to the Corporal, as he was putting him to

Lieutenant, with a ſon to ſubſiſt as well as himſelf
out of his pay,+that thou didſt not make an offer
to him of my purſe; becauſe, had he ſtood in need,
thou knoweſt, Trim, he had been as welcome to it
as myſelf—Your honour knows, ſaid the Corporal,
I had no orders;—True, quoth my uncle Toby,+
thou didſt very right, Trim, as a ſoldier—but
certainly very wrong as a man.
In the ſecond place, for which indeed, thou haſt
the ſame excuſe, continued my uncle Toby, when
thou offeredſt him whatever was in my houſe,_
thou ſhouldſt have offered him my houſe too: A
ſick brother officer ſhould have the beſt quarters,
Trim, and if we had him with us, -we could tend
and look to him:—Thou art an excellent nurſe
thyſelf, Trim, and what with thy care of him, and
the old woman's, and his boy’s, and mine to-
gether, we might recruit him again at once, and
fet him upon his legs.-
—In a fortnight or three weeks, added my uncle
Toby ſmiling,-he might march.-He will never
march an” pleaſe your honour, in this world, ſaid
the Corporal:—He will march; ſaid my uncle Toby,

will nover march, but to his grave:—He ſhalf
march, cried my uncle Toby, marching the foot
which had a ſhoe on, though without advancing
an inch,--he ſhall march to his regiment.—He
cannot ſtand it, ſaid the Corporal;-He ſhall be
ſupported, ſaid my uncle Toby –He'll drop at laſt,
ſaid the Corporal, and what will become of his
boy?—He ſhall not drop, ſaid my uncle Toby,
firmly.—A-well-o'day,+do what we can for him,
ſaid Trim, maintaining his point, the poor ſoul
will die:—He ſhall not die, by G–, cried my
uncle Toby.
—The Accusing spirit, which flew up to hea-
ven's chancery with the oath, bluſh’d as he gave
it in;–and the REcoRDING ANGEL, as he wrote it
down, dropp'd a tear upon the word, and blotted
it out for ever. -
—My uncle Toby went to his bureau,-put
his purſe into his breeches pocket, and having or-
dered the Corporal to go early in the morning for
a phyſician,—he went to bed and fell aſleep.
The ſun looked bright the morning after, to
every eye in the village but Le Fever’s and his af.
flićted ſon’s; the hand of death preſs'd heavy upon

His eye-lids,-and hardly could the wheel at the
ciſtern turn round its circle, when my uncle Toby,
who had roſe up an hour before his wonted time,
entered the Lieutenant's room, and without pre-
face or apology, fat himſelf down upon the chair
by the bed-ſide, and independently of all modes and
cuſtoms, opened the curtain in the manner an old
friend and brother officer would have done it, and
aſked him how he did, how he had reſted in the
night-what was his complaint, where was his
pain,_and what he could do to help him: and
without giving him time to anſwer any one of the
enquiries, went on and told him of the little plan
which he had been concerting with the Corpora
the night before, for him.
You ſhall go home direétly, Le Fever, ſaid my
uncle Toby, to my houſe,_and we’ll ſend for a
doćtor to ſee what’s the matter, -and we’ll have
an apothecary, and the Corporal ſhall be your
nurſe;—and I’ll be your ſervant, Le Fever.
There was a frankneſs in my uncle Toby, not
the effei of familiarity,–but the cauſe of it,
which let you at once into his ſoul,—and ſhewed
you the goodneſs of his nature; to this, there was
ſomething in his looks, and voice, and manner,
ſuperadded,

<page 55>

ſuperadded, which eternally beckoned to the un-
fortunate to come and take ſhelter under him ;
ſo that before my uncle Toby had half finiſhed the
kind offers he was making to the father, had the
fon inſenſibly preſſed up cloſe to his knees, and had
taken hold of the breaſt of his coat, and was pulling
it towards him.—The blood and ſpirits of Le Fever,
which were waxing cold and ſlow within him, and
were retreating to their laſt citadel, the heart,-
rallied back,-the film forſook his eyes for a mo-
ment, he looked up wiſhfully in my uncle Toby’s
face,—then caſt a look upon his boy, and that
ligament, fine as it was, -was never broken.—
Nature inſtantly ebb’d again;-the film returned
to its place,—the pulſe fluttered—ſtopp’d—went
on—throbb’d—ſtopp'd again—moved—ſtopp’d—.
ſhall I go on?—No. "
All that is neceſſary to be added is as follows—
That my uncle Toby, with young Le Fever in
his hand, attended the poor Lieutenant, as chief
mourners, to his grave.
When my uncle Toby had turned every thing
into money, and ſettled all accounts betwixt the
age Int

agent of the regiment and Le Fever, and betwixt
Le Fever, and all mankind,-there remained no-
thing more in my uncle Toby’s hands, than an old
regimental coat and a ſword; ſo that my uncle
Toby found little or no oppoſition from the world
in taking adminiſtration. The coat my uncle Toby
gave the Corporal;—Wear it, Trim, ſaid my uncle
Toby as long as it will hold together, for the ſake of
the poor Lieutenant—And this, ſaid my uncle Toby,
taking up the ſword in his hand, and drawing it
out of the ſcabbard as he ſpoke—and this, Le Fever,
I'll ſave for thee—'tis all the fortune, continued my
uncle Toby, hanging it up upon a crook, and
pointing to it, 'tis all the fortune, my dear La .
Fever, which God has left thee; but if he has
given thee a heart to fight thy way with it in the
world,—and thou doeſt it like a man of honour,
'tis enough for us.
As ſoon as my uncle Toby had laid a foundation,
he ſent him to a public ſchool, where, excepting
Whitſuntide and Chriſtmas, at which times the
Corporal was punétually diſpatched for him,-he
remained to the ſpring of the year, ſeventeen ;
when the ſtories of the Emperor's ſending his army

of fire in his boſom, he left his Greek and Latin,

without leave, and throwing himſelf upon his knees
before my uncle Toby, begged his father's ſword,
and my uncle Toby’s leave along with it, to go and
try his fortune under Eugene.—Twice did my uncle
Toby forget his wound, and cry out Le Fever! I
will go with thee, and thou ſhalt fight beſide me—
And twice he laid his hand upon his groin, and
hung down his head in ſorrow and diſconſolation.—
My uncle Toby took down the ſword from the
crook, where it had hung untouched ever ſince the
Lieutenant’s death, and delivered it to the Corporal
to brighten up 3–and having detained Le Fever a
ſingle fortnight to equip him, and contract for his
paſſage to Leghorn,--he put the ſword into his
hand,-If thou art brave, Le Fever, ſaid my uncle
Toby, this will not fail thee, but Fortune, ſaid
he (muſing a little)—Fortune may—And if ſhe
does, added my uncle Toby, embracing him,
come back again to me, Le Fever, and we will ſhape
thee another courſe, '..."
The greateſt injury could not have oppreſſed the
heart of Le Fever more than my uncle Toby’s pa-
ternal kindneſs;–he parted from my uncle Toby,

dropped tears -

old purſe of his father's, in which was his mother’s

Le Fever got up to the Imperial army juſt time
enough to try what metal his ſword was made of
at the defeat of the Turks before Belgrade ; but a

from that moment, and trod cloſe upon his heels

theſe buffetings to the laſt, till ſickneſs overtook him
at Marſeilles, from whence he wrote my uncle
Toby word, he had loſt his time, his ſervices, his
health, and, in ſhort, every thing but his ſword;—
and was waiting for the firſt ſhip to return back
to him.
Le Fever was hourly expe&ted ; and was upper-
moſt in my uncle Toby’s mind all the time my
father was giving him and Yorick a deſcription of
what kind of a perſon he would chooſe for a precep-

father at firſt ſomewhat fanciful in the accompliſh-

Fever’s name, till the chara&ter, by Yorick’s inter-

ſmooth doyemake theroad of it! like grace and
beauty which beget inclinations to love at firſt ſight:
'tis ye who open this door and let the ſtranger in.
—Pray, Madame, ſaid I, have the goodneſs to
tell me which way I muſt turn to go to the Opera
Comique:–Moſt willingly, Monſieur, ſaid ſhe, lay-
ing aſide her work.
I had given a caſt with my eye into half a dozen
ſhops as I came along in ſearch of a face not likely
to be diſordered by ſuch an interruption; till at laſt,
this hitting my fancy, I had walked in.
She was working a pair of ruffles as ſhe ſat in a
low chair on the far ſide of the ſhop facing the
door
—Tres volontiers : moſt willingly, ſaid ſhe, lay-
ing her work down upon a chair next her, and

riſing up from the low chair ſhe was ſitting in,
with ſo cheerful a movement and ſo cheerful a look,
that had I been laying out fifty louis d’ors with her,
I ſhould have ſaid—“This woman is grateful.”
You muſt turn, Monſieur, ſaid ſhe, going with
me to the door of the ſhop, and pointing the way
down the ſtreet I was to take—you muſt turn firſt
to your left hand—mais premez garde—there are
two turns; and be ſo good as to take the ſecond—
then go down a little way and you’ll ſee a church,
and when you are paſt it, give yourſelf the trouble
to turn directly to the right, and that will lead you
to the foot of the pont meuf, which you muſt croſs
—and there any one will do himſelf the pleaſure to
ſhew you
She repeated her inſtructions three times over to
me, with the ſame good-natured patience the third
time as the firſt;-and if tones and manners have a
meaning, which certainly they have, unleſs to
hearts which ſhut them out—ſhe ſeemed really in-
tereſted, that I ſhould not loſe myſelf.
I will not ſuppoſe it was the woman's beauty,
notwithſtanding ſhe was the handſomeſt griſſet, I
think, I ever ſaw, which had much to do with the

ſenſe I had of her courteſy; only I remember, when
I told her how much I was obliged to her, that I
looked very full in her eyes, and that I repeated
my thanks as often as ſhe had done her inſtructions,
I had not got ten paces from the door, before I
found I had forgot every tittle of what ſhe had ſaid
—ſo lookingback, and ſeeing her ſtill ſtandinginthe
door of the ſhop as if to look whether I went right or
not—I returned back, to aſk her whether the firſt
turn was to my right or left—for that I had abſo-
lutely forgot.—Is it poſſible! ſaid ſhe, half laughing.
—'Tis very poſſible, replied I, when a manis think-
ing more of a woman, than of her good advice,
As this was the real truth—ſhe took it, as every
woman takes a matter of right with a ſlight
courteſy,
—Attendez, ſaid ſhe, laying her hand upon
my arm to detain me, whilſt ſhe called a lad out
of the back-ſhop to get ready a parcel of gloves. I
am juſt going to ſend him, ſaid ſhe, with a packet
into that quarter, and if you will have the complai-
ſance to ſtep in, it will be ready in a moment, and
he ſhall attend you to the place. So I walked in
with her to the far ſide of the ſhop, and taking up.

the ruffle in my hand which ſhe laid upon the chair,
as if I had a mind to ſit, ſhe ſat down herſelf in her
low chair, and I inſtantly ſat myſelf down beſide
her.
——He will be ready, Monſieur, ſaid ſhe, in a
moment And in that moment, replied I, moſt
willingly would I ſay ſomething very civil to you
for all theſe courteſies. Any one may do a caſual
act of good nature, but a continuation of them
ſhews it is a part of the temperature; and
certainly, added I, if it is the ſame blood which
comes from the heart, which deſcends to the ex-.
tremes (touching her wriſt), I am ſure you muſt,
have one of the beſt pulſes of any woman in the
world Feel it, ſaid ſhe, holding out her arm.
So laying down my hat, I took hold of her fingers
in one hand, and applied the two fore-fingers of
my other to the artery—
——Would to heaven! my dear Eugenius, thou
hadſt paſſed by, and beheld me ſitting in my black
coat, and in my lack-aday-ſical manner, counting
the throbs of it, one by one, with as much true
devotion as if I had been watching the critical ebb

—So much the better: for when my views
are dire&t, Eugenius, I care not if all the world ſaw
me feel it.
I had counted twenty pulſations, and was going
on faſt towards the fortieth, when her huſband,
coming unexpected from a back parlour into the
ſhop, put me a little out of my reckoning.—’Twas
nobody but her huſband, ſhe ſaid, -ſo I began a
freſh ſcore Monſieur is ſo good, quoth ſhe, as he
paſs'd by us, as to give himſelf the trouble of feeling
my pulſe—The huſband took off his hat, and
making a bow, ſaid I did him too much honour—
and having ſaid that, he put on his hat, and walk-
ed out.
Good God! ſaid I to myſelf, as he went out
and can this man be the huſband of this woman :

In London a ſhop-keeper and a ſhop-keeper's wife
feem to be one bone and one fleſh : in the ſeveral
endowments of mind and body, ſometimes the one,
foul times the other has it, ſo as in general to be
upon a par, and to tally with each other as nearly
as man and wife need to do.
In Paris, there are ſcarce two orders of beings

The beautiful Griſſet roſe up when I ſaid this,

parcel and untied it : I advanced to the ſide over

to be the leaſt—She held it open—my hand ſlipped

There are certain combined looks of ſimpſe
ſubtlety——where whim, and ſenſe, and ſeriouſ-
neſs, and nonſenſe, are ſo blended, that all the
languages of Babel ſet looſe together could not ex-
preſs them—they are communicated and caught ſo
inſtantaneouſly; that you can ſcarce ſay which party
is the infector. I leave it to your men of words to
twell pages about it—it is enough in the preſent to
ſay again, the gloves would not do; ſo folding our
hands within our arms, we both loll’d upon the
counter—it was narrow, and there was juſt room.
for the parcel to lay between us.
The beautiful Griſſet looked ſometimes at the
gloves, then ſide-ways to the window, then at the
loves——and then at me. I was not diſpoſed to
break ſilence—I followed her example: ſo I looked
at the gloves, then to the window, then at the
gloves, and then at her—and ſo on alternately.
I found I loſt conſiderably in every attack—ſhe
had a quick black eye, and ſhot through two ſuch
long and filken eye-laſhes with ſuch penetration,
that ſhe looked into my very heart and reins—It
may ſeem ſtrange, but I could actually feel ſhe

It is no matter, ſaid I, taking up a couple of
the pairs next me, and putting them into my
pocket.
I was ſenſible the beautiful Griſſet had not aſk’d
above a fingle livre above the price—I wiſh’d ſhe
had aſk’d a livre more, and was puzzling my brains
how to bring the matter about Do you think,
my dear Sir, ſaid ſhe, miſtaking my embarraſſment,
that I could aſk a ſous too much of a ſtranger—
and of a ſtranger whoſe politeneſs, more than his
want of gloves, has done me the honour to lay .
himſelf at my mercy —M’en croyez capable?—
Faith ! not I, ſaid I; and if you were, you are
welcome—ſo counting the money into her hand,
and with a lower bow than one generally makes to
a ſhopkeeper’s wife, I went out, and her lad with
his parcel followed me.

E EING a man ſtanding with a baſket on the
other ſide of a ſtreet, in Verſailles, as if he had
ſomething to ſell, I bid La Fleur go up to him and
enquire for the Count de B “ ”’s hotel.
La Fleur returned a little pale : and told me it
was a Chevalier de St. Louis ſelling paté—It is im-
poſſible, La Fleur ! ſaid I.-La Fleur could no
more account for the phenomenon than myſelf;
but perfifted in his ſtory: he had ſeen the croix ſet
in gold, with its red ribband, he ſaid, tied to his
button-hole—and had looked into his baſket and
ſeen the paté, which the Chevalier was felling; ſo
could not be miſtaken in that.
Such a reverſe in a man’s life awakens a better
principle than curioſity: I could not help looking
for ſome time at him as I ſat in the remiſe—the
more I looked at him, his croix and his baſket
the ſtronger they wove themſelves into my brain
—I got out of the remiſe and went towards him.
He

<page 70>
THE BEAUTIES OF STERNE. 33
He was begirt with a clean linen apron which
fell below his knees, and with a ſort of a bib which
went half way up his breaſt ; upon the top of this,
but a little below the hem; hung his croix. His
baſket of little paté was covered over with a
white damaſk napkin ; another of the ſame kind
was ſpread at the bottom; and there was a look of
propreté and neatneſs throughout; that one might
have bought his patés of him, as much from appe-
tite as ſentiment.
He made an offer of them to neither; but ſtood
ſtill with them at the corner of a hotel, for
thoſe to buy who choſe it, without ſolicitation.
He was about forty-eight—of a ſedate look, ſome-
what approaching to gravity. I did not wonder-
I went up rather to the baſket than him, and hav-
ing lifted up the napkin and taken one of his paté
into my hand—I begg’d he would explain the ap-
pearance which affected me.
He told me in a few words, that the beſt part
of his life had paſſed in the ſervice, in which, after
ſpending a ſmall patrimony, he had obtained a
company and the croix with it; but that, at the
concluſion of the laſt peace, his regiment being
reformed

<page 71>
34 THE BEAUTIES OF STERNE,
reformed, and the whole corps, with thoſe of
ſome other regiments, left without any proviſion,
—he found himſelf in a wide world without
friends, without a livre—and indeed, ſaid he,
without any thing but this—(pointing, as he ſaid
it, to his croix)—The poor Chevalier won my pity,
and he finiſhed the ſcene with winning my eſteem
to O.
The king, he ſaid, was the moſt generous of
princes, but his generoſity could neither relieve
: or reward every one, and it was only his misfor-
tune to be amongſt the number. He had a little
wife, he ſaid, whom he loved, who did the patiſ.
ſerie; and added, he felt no diſhonour in defend-
ing her and himſelf from want in this way—un-
leſs providence had offered him a better.
It would be wicked to withhold a pleaſure
from the good, in paſſing over what happened to
this poor Chevalier of St. Louis about nine months
after.
It ſeem; he uſually took his ſtand near the iron
gates which lead up to the palace, and as his
croik had caught the eyes of numbers, numbers
had made the ſame enquiry which I had done—

He had told them the ſame ſtory, and always
with ſo much modeſty and good ſenſe, that it
had reached at laſt the King's ears—who hearing
the Chevalier had been a gallant officer, and re-
ſpected by the whole regiment as a man of honour
and integrity—he broke up his little trade by a
penſion of fifteen hundred livres a year.

7HEN ſtates and empires have their periods
of declenſion, and feel in their turns what
diſtreſs and poverty is—I ſtop not to tell the
cauſes which gradually brought the houſe d’E****
in Britanny into decay. The Marquis d’E**** had
fought up againſt his condition with great firm-
neſs; wiſhing to preſerve, and ſtill ſhew to the
world, ſome little fragments of what his anceſtors
had been—their indiſcretions had put it out of his
power. There was enough left for the little
exigencies of obſcurity—But he had two boys
who looked up to him for light—he thought they
deſerved it. He had tried his ſword—it could
not open the way—the mounting was too expen-
ſive—and ſimple oeconomy was not a match for
it—there was no reſource but commerce,
In any other province in France, ſave Britanny,
this was ſmiting the root for ever of the little tree
his pride and affection wiſhed to ſee re-bloſſom—
But

<page 74>
THE BEAUTIES OF STERNE. 37
But in Britanny, there being a proviſion for this,
he availed himſelf of it; and taking an occaſion
when the ſtates were aſſembled at Rennes, the
Marquis, attended with his two ſons, entered the
court ; and having pleaded the right of an ancient
law of the duchy, which, though ſeldom claimed,
he ſaid, was no leſs in force; he took his ſword
from his ſide Here, ſaid he, take it ; and be
truſty guardians of it, till better times put me in
condition to reclaim it.
The preſident accepted the Marquis’s ſword—
he ſtaid a few minutes to ſee it depoſited in the
archives of his houſe, and departed.
The Marquis and his whole family embarked
the next day for Martinico, and in about nineteen
or twenty years of ſucceſsful application to buſi-
neſs, with ſome unlooked for bequeſts from diſtant
branches of his houſe—returned home to reclaim
his nobility and to ſupport it.
It was an incident of good fortune which will
never happen to any traveller, but a ſentimental
one, that I ſhould be at Rennes at the very time
of this ſolemn requiſition: I call it ſolemn it
was ſo to me.

The Marquis entered the court with his whole
family: he ſupported his lady—his eldeſt ſon ſup-
ported his ſiſter, and his youngeſt, was at the other
extreme of the line next his mother——he put
his handkerchief to his face twice—
There was a dead ſilence. When the
Marquis had approached within ſix paces of the
tribunal, he gave the Marchioneſs to his youngeſt
ſon, and advancing three ſteps before his family—
he reclaimed his ſword.—His ſword was given
him, and the moment he got it into his hand he
drew it almoſt out of the ſcabbard—it was the
ſhining face of a friend he had once given up—
he looked attentively along it, beginning at
the hilt, as if to ſee whether it was the ſame—
when obſerving a little ruſt which it had contrac-
ted near the point, he brought it near his eye, and
bending his head down over it—I think I ſaw a
tear fall upon the place : I could not be deceived
by what followed.
“I ſhall find, ſaid he, ſome other way to get
44 it off.”
, When the Marquis had ſaid this, he return-
ed his ſword into its ſcabbard, made a bow to

dubious, with his two fore-feet on the inſide of the
threſhold, and with his two hinder feet towards

Now, 'tis an animal (be in what hurry I may) I

trary, meet him where I will—whether in town
or country—in cart or under panniers—whether
in liberty or bondage—I have ever ſomething civil
to ſay to him on my part; and as one word begets
another (if he has as little to do as I)—I generally
fall into converſation with him ; and ſurely never
is my imagination ſo buſy, as in framing his re-
ſpenſes from the etchings of his countenance—
and where thoſe carry me not deep enough—in
flying from my own heart into his, and ſeeing
what is natural for an aſs to think—as well as a
man, upon the occaſion.—In truth, it is the only
creature of all the claſſes of beings below me, with
whom I can do this:—for parrots, jackdaws, &c.
I never exchange a word with them—nor with
the apes, &c. for pretty near the ſame reaſon ;
they ačt by rote, as the others ſpeak by it, and
equally make me ſilent ; may my dog and my cat
though I value them both—(and for my dog he
would ſpeak if he could)—yet ſome how or other
they neither of them poſſeſs the talents for con-
verſation—I can make nothing of a diſcourſe with

And now thy mouth, if one knew the truth of
it, is as bitter, I dare ſay, as foot—(for he had
caſt aſide the ſtem) and thou haſt not a friend per-

heart ſmites me, that there was more of plea-
fantry in the conceit, of ſeeing how an aſs would
eat a macaroon,_than of benevolenge in giving
him one, which preſided in the act.

fed him to come in—the poor beaſt was heavy

he hung rather backwards, and as I pulled at his
halter, it broke ſhort in my hand—he looked up
penſive in my face “Don’t thraſh me with it

“In other matters we may be deceived by falſe

conſcious of the web ſhe has wove ;--knows
its texture and fineneſs, and the exact ſhare
which every paſſion has had in working upon the
ſeveral deſigns which virtue or vice has planned
before her.” -
[The language is good, and I declare Trim reads
very well, quoth my father.]

“Now,-as conſcience is nothing elſe but the
knowledge which the mind has within herſelf of
this ; and the judgment, either of approbation
or cenſure, which it unavoidably makes upon tile
ſucceſſive actions of our lives ; ’tis plain you will
ſay, from the very terms of the propoſition,--

[Then the apoſtle is altogether in the wrong,
I ſuppoſe, quoth Dr. Slop, and the Proteſtant di-
vine is in the right. Sir, have patience, replied my
father, for I think it will preſently appear that
Saint Paul and the Proteſtant divine are both of
an opinion.—As nearly ſo, quoth Dr. Slop, as
eaſt is to weſt;-but this, continued he, lifting both
hands, comes from the liberty of the preſs.
It is no more, at the worſt, replied my uncle
Tºby, than the liberty of the pulpit, for it does not
appear that the ſermon is printed, or ever likely
to be.
Go on, Trim, quoth my father.]

ſide) that he is guilty; and unleſs in melancholy
and hypocondriac caſes, we may ſafely pronounce
upon it, that there is always ſufficient grounds

“A man ſhall be vicious and utterly debauched
in his principles;–exceptionable in his condućt
to the world; ſhall live ſhameleſs in the open
commiſſion of a ſin, which no reaſon or pretence
can juſtify, a ſin by which, contrary to all the
workings of humanity, he ſhall ruin for ever the
deluded partner of his guilt;-rob her of her beſt
dowry; and not only cover her own head with
diſhonour;—but involve a whole virtuous family
in ſhame and ſorrow for her ſake. Surely, you
will think conſcience muſt lead ſuch a man a
troubleſome life;—he can have no reſt night or
day from its reproaches.
“Alas! conscience had ſomething elſe to do
all this time, than break in upon him; as Elijans
reproached the god Baal, this domeſtic god
was either talking or purſuing, or was in a jour-
ney or peradventure he ſlept and could not be

“ more ſo, than a much better man.”
All this is impoſſible with us, quoth Dr. Slop,
turning to my father, the caſe could not happen
in our church. It happens in ours, however,
replied my father, but too often.
Dr. Slop, (ſtruck a little with my father's frank ac-
knowledgment)—that a man in the Romiſh church
may live as badly;—but then he cannot eaſily die
ſo. 'Tis little matter, replied my father, with
an air of indifference,—how a raſcal dies.—I mean,
anſwered Dr. Slop, he would be denied the benefits
of the laſt ſacraments. Prayhow many have you
in all, ſaid my uncle Toby, for I always forget?
Seven, anſwered Dr. Slop, Humph!—
ſaid my uncle Toby; though not accented as a note
of acquieſcence,—but as an interječtion of that par-
ticular ſpecies of ſurpriſe, when a man in looking
into a drawer, finds more of a thing than he ex-
pećted,—Humph! replied my uncle Toby; Dr.
Slop

him) Why, Sir, are there not ſeven cardinal
virtues?—Seven mortal ſins?—Seven golden can-
ſeven ſacraments.

know, replied my uncle Toby. Are there not
Seven wonders of the world?—Seven days of the

“Let him conſider in how different a degree
of deteſtation, numbers of wicked actions
ſtand there, tho’ equally bad and vicious in
their own natures;–he will ſoon find, that
ſuch of them as ſtrong inclination and cuſtom

moſt paſſed from the firſt commiſſion of that
crime, to the time Nathan was ſent to re-
prove him; and we read not once of the
leaſt ſorrow or compunction of heart which
he teſtified, during all that time, for what
he had done.
“ Thus conſcience, this once able monitor,
—placed on high as a judge within us, and
intended by our Maker as a juſt and equitable
one too, by an unhappy train of cauſes and

nizance of what paſſes,—does its office ſo
negligently,–ſometimes ſo corruptly,–that
it is not to be truſted alone; and therefore
we find there is a neceſſity, an abſolute ne-
ceflity of joining another principal with it,
to aid, if not govern, its determinations.
“So that if you would form a juſt judgment

“Firſt, Whenever a man talks loudly againſt
religion, always ſuſpect that it is not his
reaſon, but his paſſions, which have got the
better of his cKEED. A bad life and a good
belief are diſagreeable and troubleſome neigh-
bours, and where they ſeparate, depend upon
it, 'tis for no other cauſe but quietneſs
ſake.
“Secondly, When a man, thus repreſented,
tells you in any particular inſtance,—That

always believe he means exactly the ſame
thing, as when he tells you ſuch a thing
goes againſt his ſtomach;—a preſent want
of appetite being generally the true cauſe of
both.
“In a word,—truſt that man in nothing,
who has not a conscience in every thing.

white dimity waiſtcoat and breeches, and hat
a little o'one ſide, paſſing jollily along the ſtreet,
ſwinging his ſtick, with a ſmile and a cheerful
word for every body he met.
But alas! Tom 1 thou ſmileſt no more, cried
the Corporal, looking on one ſide of him upon

Then he reſembled thee, Trim, ſaid my uncle

The Corporal bluſhed down to his finger ends
—a tear of ſentimental baſhfulneſs—another of

for his brother's misfortunes, ſtarted into his

to eaſe his lame leg, but in reality to gratify a
finer feeling—he ſtood ſilent for a minute and a
half; at the end of which he took his hand away,
and the Corporal making a bow, went on with
his ſtory of his brother and the jew’s widow. -
When Tom, an” pleaſe your honour, got to
the ſhop, there was nobody in it, but a poor
negro girl, with a bunch of whitefeathers ſlight-
ly tied to the end of a long cane, flapping away
flies—not killing them.
'Tis a pretty pićture ſaid my uncle Toby,

The Corporal returned to his ſtory, and went -
on. but with an embarraſſment in doing
it, which here and there a reader in this world
will not be able to comprehend ; for by the
many ſudden tranſitions all along, from one kind
and cordial paſſion to another, in getting thus far
on his way, he had loſt the ſportable key of his
voice, which gave ſenſe and ſpirit to his tale:
he attempted twice to reſume it but could not
pleaſe himſelf; ſo giving a ſtout hem to rally
back the retreating ſpirits, and aiding nature at
the ſame time with his left arm a-kimbo on one
ſide, and with his right a little extended, ſup-
ported her on the other—the Corporal got as
near the note as he could ; and in that attitude.

widow about love—and being, as I have told
your honour, an open, cheary hearted lad, with
his character wrote in his looks and carriage,
he took a chair, and without much apology, but
with great civility at the ſame time, placed it
cloſe to her at the table, and ſat down.
Now a widow, an” pleaſe your honour, al-
ways chooſes a ſecond huſband as unlike the firſt
as ſhe can : ſo the affair was ſettled in her mind
before Tom mentioned it.
She ſigned the capitulation—and Tom ſealed

of it—It’s high time I ſhould—ſaid my uncle
Toby.
Your honour remembers with concern, faid
the Corporal, the total route and confuſion of our
camp, and the army, at the affair of Landen ;
every one was left to ſhift for himſelf; and if it
had not been for the regiments of Wyndham,
Lumley, and Galway, which covered the retreat
over the bridge of Neerſpeeken, the King him-
ſelf could ſcarce have gained it—he was preſſed

Gallant mortal cried my-uncle Toby, caught
up with enthuſiaſm—this moment, now that all
is loſt, I ſee him galloping acroſs me, Corporal,
to the left, to bring up the remains of the Engliſh
horſe along with him to ſupport the right, and
tear the laurel from Luxembourg’s brows, if yet
'tis poſſible—I ſee him with the knot of his
ſcarf juſt ſhot off, infuſing freſh ſpirits into
poor Galway’s regiment—riding along the line
—then wheeling about, and charging Conti at
the head of it—Bravel brave, by heaven! cried
my uncle Toby, he deſerves a crown—as richly
as a thief a halter ; ſhouted Trim.
My uncle Toby knew the Corporal’s loyalty;
—otherwiſe the compariſon was not at all to his
mind—it did not altogether ſtrike the Corporal’s
fancy when he had made it—but it could not be
recalled—ſo he had nothing to do, but proceed.
As the number of wounded was prodigious,
and no one had time to think of any thing, but
his own ſafety—Though Talmaſh, ſaid my uncle
Toby, brought off the foot with great prudence—
but I was left upon the field, ſaid the Corporal.
Thou waſt ſo ; poor fellow replied my uncle
Toby—ſo that it was noon the next day, con-
tinued the Corporal, before I was exchanged,

and put into a cart with thirteen or four-
teen more, in order to be conveyed to our
hoſpital.-The anguiſh of my knee, continued
the Corporal, was exceſſive in itſelf; and the un-
eaſineſs of the cart, with the roughneſs of the
roads which were terribly cut up—making bad
ſtill worſe—every ſtep was death to me : ſo that
with the loſs of blood, and the want of care
taking of me, and a fever I felt coming on be-
ſides—(Poor ſoul ſaid my uncle Toby) all to-
gether, an” pleaſe your honour, was more than I
could ſuſtain.
I was telling my ſufferings to a young woman
at a peaſant’s houſe, where our cart, which was
the laſt of the line, had halted, they had helped
me in, and the young woman had taken a cordial
out of her pocket and dropp'd it upon ſome
ſugar, and ſeeing it had cheer'd me, ſhe had
given it me a ſecond and a third time. So I
was telling her, an” pleaſe your honour, the
anguiſh I was in, and was ſaying it was ſo in-
tolerable to me, that I had much rather lie down
upon the bed, turning my face towards one
which was in the corner of the room—and die,
than go on—when, upon her attempting to lead
me to it, I fainted away in her arms. She was.

a good ſoul! as your honour, ſaid the Corporal,
wiping his eyes, will hear.
I thought love had been a joyous thing, quoth
my uncle Toby
'Tis the moſt ſerious thing, an” pleaſe your
honour (ſometimes), that is in the world.
By the perſuaſion of the young woman, con-
tinued the Corporal, the cart with the wounded
men ſet off without me: ſhe had aſſured them I
ſhould expire immediately if I was put into the
cart. So when I came to myſelf—I found Iny-
ſelf in a ſtill quiet cottage, with no one but the
young woman, and the peaſant and his wife. I
was laid acroſs the bed in the corner of the room,
with my wounded leg upon a chair, and the
young woman beſide me, holding the corner of
her handkerchief dipp'd in vinegar to my noſe
with one hand, and rubbing my temples with
the other.
I took her at firſt for the daughter of the
peaſant; (for it was no inn)—ſo had offered her
a little purſe with eighteen florins, which my
poor brother Tom (here Trim wip’d his eyes)
- had

<page 120>
THE BEAUTIES OF STERNE. 83
had ſent me as a token, by a recruit, juſt before
he ſet out for Liſbon.
The young woman called the old man and
his wife into the room, to ſhew them the money,
in order to gain me credit for a bed and what
little neceſſaries I ſhould want, till I ſhould be in
a condition to be got to the hoſpital Come
then! ſaid ſhe, tying up the little purſe, I’ll be
your banker—but as that office alone will not
keep me employ’d, I’ll be your nurſe too.
I thought by her manner of ſpeaking this, as
well as by her dreſs, which I then began to con-
ſider more attentively—that the young woman
could not be the daughter of the peaſant. She
was in black down to her toes, with her hair
concealed under a cambrick border, laid cloſe
to her forehead : ſhe was one of thoſe kind of
Nuns, an” pleaſe your honour, of which your
honour knows, there are a good many in
Fanders, which they let go looſe—By thy de-
ſcription, Trim, ſaid my uncle Toby, I dare ſay ſhe
was a young Beguine, of which there are none
to be found any where but in the Spaniſh Nether-
lands—except at Amſterdam—they differ from
Nuns in this, that they can quit their cloiſter if

they chooſe to marry : they viſit and take care
of the ſick by profeſſion—I had rather, for my
own part, they did it out of good-nature.
The young Reguine, continued the Corporal,
had ſcarce given herſelf time to tell me “ ſhe
would be my nurſe,” when ſhe haſtily turned
about to begin the office of one, and prepare
fomething for me—and in a ſhort time—though
I thought it a long one—ſhe came back with
fannels, &c. &c. and having fomented my knee
ſoundly for a couple of hours, and made me a
thin baſon of gruel for my ſupper—ſhe wiſh'd
me reſt, and promiſed to be with me early in the
morning. She wiſh'd me, an” pleaſe your
honour, what was not to be had. My fever ran
very high that night—her figure made ſad diſ-
turbance within me—I was every moment cut-
ting the world in two—to give her half of it—
and every moment was I crying, that I had
nothing but a knapſack and eighteen florins to
ſhare with her—The whole night long was
the fair Beguine, like an angel, cloſe by my bed
fide, holding back my curtain and offering me
cordials—and I was only awakened from my
dream by her coming there at the hour promiſed
and giving them in reality. In truth, ſhe was
ſcarce

<page 122>
THE BEAUTIES OF STERNE. 85
ſcarce ever from me, and ſo accuſtomed was I to
receive life from her hands, that my heart
ſickened, and I loſt colour when ſhe left the
room.——Love, an” pleaſe your honour, is ex-
aćtly like war, in this ; that a ſoldier, though
he has eſcaped three weeks complete o'Saturday-
might—may nevertheleſs be ſhot through his
heart on Sunday morning—it happened ſo here,
an pleaſe your honour, with this difference
only—that it was on Sunday in the afternoon,
when I fell in love all at once with a ſiſterara—
it burſt upon me, an” pleaſe your honour, like a
bomb—ſcarce giving me time to ſay, “God
bleſs me.”
I thought Trim, ſaid my uncle Toby, a man
never fell in love ſo very ſuddenly.
Yes, an” pleaſe your honour, if he is in the
way of it—replied Trim.
I prithee, quoth my uncle Toby, inform me
how this matter happened.

Corporal, all that time from falling in love, and

had gone on to the end of the chapter, had it
not been predeſtined otherwiſe—there is no re-
fiſting our fate. It was on a Sunday, in the
aſternoon, as I told your honour. The old man
and his wiſe had walked out—Every thing was
ſtill and huſh as midnight about the houſe—
There was not ſo much as a duck or a duck-
ling about the yard; when the fair Beguine
came in to ſee me.
My wound was then in a fair way of doing
well—the inflammation had been gone off for
ſome time, but it was ſucceeded with an itching
both above and below my knee, ſo inſufferable,
that I had not ſhut my eyes the whole night for
it. Let me ſee it, ſaid ſhe, kneeling down upon
the ground parallel to my knee, and laying her
hand upon the part below it—it only wants rub-
bing a little, ſaid the Beguine; ſo covering it
with the bed cloathes, ſhe began with the fore-
finger of her right hand to rub under my knee,
guiding her fore finger backwards and forwards
by the edge of the flannel, which kept on the
dreſſing.
In five or ſix minutes I felt ſlightly the end
of her ſecond finger—and preſently it was laid
flat

<page 124>
THE BEAUTIES OF STERNE. 87
flat with the other, and ſhe continued rubbing
in that way round and round for a good while;
it then came into my head, that 1 ſhould fall in
love—I bluſhed when I ſaw how white a hand
ſhe had—I ſhall never, an” pleaſe your honour,
behold another hand ſo white whilſt I live.—
The young Beguine, continued the Corporal,
perceiving it was of great ſervice to me—from
rubbing, for ſome time, with two fingers—
proceeded to rub at length with three—till by
little and little ſhe brought down the fourth,
and then rubbed with her whole hand: I will
never ſay another word, an” pleaſe your honour,
upon hands again—but it was ſofter than ſattin.
Prithee, Trim, commend it as much as thou
wilt, ſaid my uncle Toby ; I ſhall hear thy ſtory
with the more delight—The Corporal thanked
his maſter moſt unfeignedly ; but having nothing
to ſay upon the Beguine’s hand but the ſame
over again—he proceeded to the effects of it.
The fair Beguine, ſaid the Corporal, con-
tinued rubbing with her whole hand under my
knee,_till I feared her zeal would weary her—
“I would do a thouſand times more,” ſaid ſhe
I 2 “ for

“ for the love of Chriſt.” As ſhe continued
rubbing—I felt it ſpread from under her hand,
an” pleaſe your honour, to every part of my
frame.— -
The more ſhe rubbed, and the longer ſtrokes

He was going on, when Maria, who had
made a ſhort pauſe, put the pipe to her mouth,
and began the air again—they were the ſame
notes;–yet were ten times ſweeter: It is the
evening ſervice to the Virgin, ſaid the young
man—but who has taught her to play it—
or how ſhe came by her pipe, no one knows;
we think that heaven has aſſiſted her in both ;
for ever ſince ſhe has been unſettled in her
mind, it ſeems her only conſolation—ſhe has
never once had the pipe out of her hand, but
plays that ſervice upon it almoſt night and day.
. The poſtillion delivered this with ſo much diſ.
cretion and natural eloquence, that I could not
help decyphering ſomething in his face above his
condition, and ſhould have ſiſted out his hiſtory,
had not poor Maria’s taken ſuch full poſſeſſion
of me.
We had got up by this time almoſt to the
bank where Maria was ſitting ; ſhe was in a
thin white jacket, with her hair, all but two

olive leaves twiſted a little fantaſtically on one

full force of an honeſt heart-ache, it was the

that the Virgin at laſt will reſtore her to herſelf;.
but her parents, who know her beſt, are hopeleſs,
upon that ſcore, and think her ſenſes are loſt
for ever.
As the poſtillion ſpoke this, Maria made a
cadence ſo melancholy, ſo tender and querulous,
that I ſprung out of the chaiſe to help her, and
found myſelf ſitting betwixt her and her goat

MOULINES,
NEVER felt what the diſtreſs of plenty was
in any one ſhape till now—to travel it
through the Bourbonnois, the ſweeteſt part of
France—in the hey-day of the vintage, when
Nature is pouring her abundance into every one's
lap, and every eye is lifted up a journey
through each ſtep of which muſic beats time to
Labour, and all her children are rejoicing as they
carry in their cluſters to paſs through
this with my affections flying out, and kindling
at every group before me—and every one of
them was pregnant with adventures.
Juſt heaven - it would fill up twenty
volumes and alas ! I have but a few ſmall
pages left of this to crowd it into—and half of
theſe muſt be taken up with the poor Maria my
friend Mr. Shandy met with near Moulines.
The ſtory he had told of that diſordered maid
affected me not a little in the reading; but when
I got

I got within the neighbourhood where ſhe lived,
it returned ſo ſtrong into my mind, that I could
not reſiſt an impulſe which prompted me to go
half a league out of the road, to the village
where her parents dwelt, to enquire after her.
'Tis going, Iown, like the knight of the Woe-
ful Countenance, in queſt of melancholy adven-
tures—but I know not how it is, but I am never
ſo perfeótly conſcious of the exiſtence of a ſoul
within me, as when I am entangled in them.
The old mother came to the door, her looks
told me the ſtory before ſhe opened her mouth
—She had loſt her huſband : he had died, ſhe
ſaid of anguiſh, for the loſs of Maria’s ſenſes,
about a month before—She had feared at firſt,
ſhe added, that it would have phandered her
poor girl of what little underſtanding was left—
but, on the contrary, it had brought her more
to herſelf—ſtill ſhe could not reſt—her poor
daughter, ſhe ſaid, crying, was wandering
ſomewhere about the road—
—Why does my pulſe beat languid as I write
this? and what made La Fleur, whoſe heart

ſeemed only to be tun’d to joy, to paſs the back
of his hand twice acroſs his eyes, as the woman
ſtood and told it 2 I beckoned to the poſtillion
to turn back into the road.
When we had got within half a league of
• Aoulines, at a little opening of the road leading
to a thicket, I diſcovered poor Maria ſitting un-
der a poplar—ſhe was ſitting with her elbow in
her lap, and her head Heaning on one ſide within
her hand, a ſmall brook ran at the foot of the
tree.
I bid the poſtillion go on with the chaiſe to
AMoulines—and La Fleur to beſpeak my ſupper
—and that I would walk after him.
She was dreſſed in white, and much as my
friend deſcribed her, except that her hair hung
looſe, which before was twiſted within a ſilk-net.
—She had, ſuperadded likewiſe to her jacket,
a pale green riband, which fell acroſs her ſhoulder
to the waiſt; at the end of which hung her
pipe.--Her goat had been as faithleſs as her
lover ; and ſhe had got a little dog in lieu of
him, which ſhe had kept tied by a ſtring to her
girdle; as I looked at her dog, ſhe drew him to-
wards

wards her with the ſtring—“ Thou ſhalt not
“ leave me, Sylvio,” ſaid ſhe. I looked in
Alaria's eyes, and ſaw ſhe was thinking more of
her father than of her lover or her little goat;
for as ſhe uttered them the tears trickled down
her cheeks.
I ſat down cloſe by her ; and Maria let me
wipe them away as they fell, with my handker-
chief.-I then ſteep'd it in my own—and then
in her’s—and then in mine—and then I wip’d
her's again—and as I did it, I felt ſuch unde-
ſcribable emotions within me, as I am ſure could
not be accounted for from any combinations of
matter and motion.
I am poſitive I have a ſoul; nor can, all the
books with which materialiſts have peſtered the
world ever convince me to the contrary.
When Maria had come a little to herſelf, I
aſked her if ſhe remembered a pale thin perſon
of a man who had ſat down betwixt her and
her goat about two years before ? She ſaid, ſhe
was unſettled much at that time, but remem-
bered it upon two accounts—that ill as ſhe was,
ſhe ſaw the perſon pitied her; and next, that
her

her goat had ſtolen his handkerchief, and ſhe
had beat him for the theft—ſhe had waſh’d it,
ſhe ſaid, in the brook, and kept it ever ſince in
her pocket to reſtore it to him in caſe ſhe ſhould
ever ſee him again, which, ſhe added, he had
half promiſed her. As ſhe told me this, ſhe
took the handkerchief out of her pocket to let
me ſee it; ſhe had folded it up neatly in a
couple of vine leaves, tied round with a tendril
on opening it, I ſaw an S mark’d in one
of the corners.
She had ſince that, ſhe told me, ſtray’d as
far as Rome, and walk’d round St. Peter’s once
—and return’d back—that ſhe found her way
alone acroſs the Apennines—had travell'd over
all Lombardy without money—and through the
flinty roads of Savoy without ſhoes—how ſhe
had borne it, and how ſhe had got ſupported,
ſhe could not tell but God tempers the wind,
ſaid Maria, to the ſhorn lamb.
Shorn indeed! and to the quick, ſaid I; and
waſt thou in my own land, where I have a cot-
tage, I would take thee to it and ſhelter thee:
thou ſhouldſt eat of my own bread, and drink
of my own cup—I would be kind to thy Sylvio

and when I had done thou ſhouldeſt play thy even-
ing ſong upon thy pipe, nor would the incenſe
of my ſacrifice be worſe accepted for entering
heaven along with that of a broken heart.
Nature melted within me, as I utter'd this ;
and Alaria ol ſerving, as I took out my handker-
chief, that it was ſleep'd too much already to
ke of uſe, would needs go waſh it in the ſtream
—and where will you dry it, Maria * ſaid I—

Though I hate ſalutations and greetings in

and laſt farewell of Maria.

He had not mounted half a mile higher, when

foot; I then got out of the chaiſe in good ear-
neſt 5 and ſeeing a houſe about a quarter of a
mile to the left hand, with a great deal to do,
I prevailed upon the poſtillion to turn up to it.
The look of the houſe, and of every thing about
it, as we drew nearer, ſoon reconciled me to
the diſaſter. It was a little farm houſe ſurround-
ed with about twenty acres of vineyard, about
as much corn—and cloſe to the houſe, on one
ſide, was a potagerie of an acre and an half full
of every thing which could make plenty in a
French peaſant’s houſe—and on the other ſide
was a little wood which furniſhed wherewithal
to dreſs it. It was about eight in the evening
when I got to the houſe—ſo I left the poſtillion
to manage his point as he could—and for mine,
I walked directly into the houſe.
The family conſiſted of an old grey-headed
man and his wife, with five or ſix ſons and ſons-
in-law and their ſeveral wives, and a joyous ge-
nealogy out of them,

They were all ſitting down together to their
lentil-ſoup; a large wheaten loaf was in the
middle of the table; and a flaggon of wine at
each end of it promiſed joy thro’ the ſtages of
the repaſt—’twas a feaſt of love.
The old man roſe up to meet me, and with a
reſpectful cordiality would have me ſit down at
the table ; my heart was ſet down the moment
I entered the room; ſo I ſat down at once like
a ſon of the family; and to inveſt myſelf in the
charaćter as ſpeedily as I could, I inſtantly bor-
rowed the old man's knife, and taking up the
loaf, cut myſelf a hearty luncheon; and as I did
it, I ſaw a teſtimony in every eye, not only of an
honeſt welcome, but of a welcome mix’d with
thanks that I had not ſeem'd to doubt it.
Was it this ; or tell me, Nature, what elſe it
was that made this morſel ſo ſweet—and to
what magic I owe it, that the draught I took
of their flaggon was ſo delicious with it, that
they remain upon my palate to this hour *
If the ſupper was to my taſte—the grace

WHEN ſupper was over, the old man gave
a knock upon the table with the haft of
his knife, to bid them prepare for the dance:
the moment the ſignal was given, the women and
girls ran all together into the back apartment
to tie up their hair—and the young men to the
doors to waſh their faces, and change their
ſabots: and in three minutes every ſoul was
ready upon a little eſplanade before the houſe
to begin—The old man and his wife came out
laſt, and placing me betwixt them, ſat down
upon a ſopha of turf by the door.
The old man had ſome fifty years ago been
no mean performer upon the vielle—and, at the
age he was then of, touched it well enough for
the purpoſe. His wife ſung now-and-then a little
to the tune—then intermitted—and joined her
old man again, as their children and grand-chil-
dren danced before them.

now as one of the illuſions of an imagination
which is eternally miſleading me, had not the
old man, as ſoon as the dance ended, ſaid, that
this was their conſtant way; and that all his

this was indeed ſomething the worſe for the

the gold had been touch’d up, and upon the

as the blue was not violent, it ſuited with the
coat and breeches very well: he had ſqueez’d

purſe into my pocket—button’d it up—ſet my-

The monk, as I judged from the break in his

would have ſuited a Bramin, and had I met it
upon the plains of Indoſtan, I had reverenced it.
The reſt of his outline may be given in a few
ſtrokes; one might put it into the hands of any
one to deſign, for 'twas neither elegant or other-
wiſe, but as charaćter and expreſſion made it ſo :
it was a thin, ſpare form, ſomething above the
common ſize, if it loſt not the diſtinétion by a
bend forward in the figure—but it was the atti-
tude of Intreaty ; and as it now ſtands preſent
to my imagination, it gain’d more than it loſt
by it.
When he had entered the room three paces,
he ſtood ſtill ; and laying his left-hand upon his
breaſt, (a ſlender white ſtaff with which he jour-
ney’d being in his right)—when I had got cloſe
up to him, he introduced himſelf with the little
ſtory of the wants of his convent, and the pover-
ty of his order—and did it with ſo ſim-
ple a grace—and ſuch an air of deprecation was
there in the whole caſt of his look and figure—
I was bewitched not to have been ſtruck with it.
–A better reaſon was, I had pre-determined
not to give him a ſingle fous.

—’Tis very true, ſaid I, replying to a caſt up-
wards with his eyes, with which he had con-
cluded his addreſs—'tis very true—and heaven
be their reſource who have no other but the
charity of the world, the ſtock of which, I fear,
is no way ſufficient for the many great claims
which are hourly made upon it.
As I pronounced the words great claims, he
gave a ſlight glance with his eye downwards
upon the ſleeve of his tunick—I felt the full
force of the appeal—I acknowledge it, ſaid I-
a coarſe habit, and that but once in three years
with meagre diet—are no great matters: and
the true point of pity is, as they can be earn’d
in the world with ſo little induſtry, that your
order ſhould wiſh to procure them by preſſing
upon a fund which is the property of the lame,
the blind, the aged, and the infirm—the captive
who lies down counting over and over again the
days of his afflićtions, languiſhes alſo for his
ſhare of it; and had you been of the order of

No doubt there is miſery enough in every cor-

upon the ſleeve of his tunick, in return for his

it was the peace-offering of a man who once
uſed you unkindly, but not from his heart.
The poor monk bluſh’d as red as ſcarlet. Mon
Dieu ! ſaid he, preſſing his hands together
you never uſed me unkindly.—I ſhould think,
ſaid the lady, he is not likely. I bluſh’d in my
turn; but from what movements, I leave to the
few who feel to analyſe—Excuſe me, Madame,
replied I–I treated him moſt unkindly; and
from no provocation. 'Tis impoſſible, ſaid the
lady—My God! cried the monk with a warmth
of affeveration which ſeem’d not to belong to
him—the fault was in me, and in the indiſcretion
of my zeal—the lady oppoſed it, and I joined
with her in maintaining it was impoſſible, that
a ſpirit ſo regulated as his, could give offence
to any,
I knew mot that contention could be rendered
ſo ſweet and pleaſurable a thing to the nerves as
I then felt it.—We remained ſilent, without any
ſenſation of that fooliſh pain which takes place,
when in ſuch a circle you look for ten minutes
in one another's faces without ſaying a word.
Whilſt this laſted, the monk rubb’d his horn-box
upon the ſleeve of his tunick; and as ſoon as it

too late to ſay whether it was the weakneſs

us in this conteſt—but be it as it would — he
begg’d we might exchange boxes—In ſaying
this he preſented his to me with one hand, as
he took mine from me in the other: and having
kiſs'd it—with a ſtream of good-nature in his
eyes, he put it into his boſom—and took his
leave.
I guard this box as I would the inſtrumental
parts of my religion, to help my mind on to
ſomething better: in truth, I ſeldom go abroad
without it; and oft and many a time have I
called up by it the courteous ſpirit of its owner
to regulate my own, in the juſtlings of the world;
they had found full employment for his, as I
learnt from his ſtory, till about the forty-fifth
year of his age, when upon ſome military
ſervices ill requited, and meeting at the ſame
time with a diſappointment in the tendereſt of
paſſions, he abandoned the ſword and the ſex

he had been dead near three months, and was
buried, not in his convent, but, according to his
deſire, in a little cemetery belonging to it, about
two leagues off. I had a ſtrong deſire to ſee
where they had laid him—when upon pulling
out his little horn box, as I ſat by his grave,
and plucking up a nettle or two at the head of
it, which had no buſineſs to grow there, they all
ſtruck together ſo forcibly upon my affections,
that I burſt into a flood of tears—but I am as

that they might have been or may be ſo, but
oftener from a certain generoſity and tenderneſs
of nature which diſpoſes us for compaſſion, ab-
ſtraćted from all conſiderations of ſelf: ſo that
without any obſervable act of the will, we ſuffer
with the unfortunate, and feel a weight upon
our ſpirits we know not why, on ſeeing the moſt
common inſtances of their diſtreſs. But where
the ſpectacle is uncommonly tragical, and com-
plicated with many circumſtances of miſery, the
mind is then taken captive at once, and were it
inclined to it, has no power to make reſiſtance,
but ſurrenders itſelf to all the tender emotions of
pity and deep concern. So that when one con-
ſiders this friendly part of our nature, without
looking farther, one would think it impoſſible
for man to look upon miſery without finding
himſelf in ſome meaſure attached to the intereſt
of him who ſuffers it—I ſay, one would think it
impoſſible—for there are ſome tempers—how
ſhall I deſcribe them?—formed either of ſuch
impenetrable matter, or wrought up by habitual
felfiſhneſs to ſuch an utter inſenſibility of what
becomes of the fortunes of their fellow creatures,

the accent, it had been an apoſtrophe to his

cruſt into his wallet
ſeemed to lament, it much ; and it inſtantly
brought into my mind Sancho’s lamentation for
his ; but he did it with more true touches of
Iſlatllre.

held it ſome time in his hand—then laid it upon
the bit of his aſs’s bridle—look'd wiſtfully at
the little arrangement he had made—and then
gave a ſigh.

as a friend. -
Every body who ſtood about heard the poor
fellow with concern—La Fleur offered him
money—The mourner ſaid he did not want it
—it was not the value of the aſs—but the loſs
of him.—The aſs, he ſaid, he was aſſured, loved
him—and upon this told them a long ſtory of
a miſchance upon their paſſage over the Pyre-

each other three days; during which time the

which complained “it could not get out.”——

In my return back through the paſſage, I heard
the ſame words repeated twice over; and look-

cage—“I can’t get out—I can’t get out,”
ſaid the ſtarling.
I ſtood looking at the bird: and to every
perſon who came through the paſſage it ran
fluttering to the ſide towards which they ap-
proached it, with the ſame lamentations of its
captivity—“I can’t get out,” ſaid the ſtar-
ling—God help thee! ſaid I, but I will let thee

getting it open without pulling the cage to pieces

through the trellis, preſſed his breaſt againſt it,
as if impatient—I fear, poor creature ſaid I,
I cannot ſet thee at liberty—“No,” ſaid the
ſtarling—“I can’t get out—I can’t get out,”
ſaid the ſtarling.
I vow I never had my affections more ten-
derly awakened ; nor do I remember an inci-
dent in my life, where the diffipated ſpirits, to
which my reaſon had been a bubble, were ſo
ſuddenly called home. Mechanical as the notes
were, yet ſo true in tune to nature were they
chanted, that in one moment they overthrew all
my ſyſtematic reaſonings upon the Baſtile ; and
I heavily walked up ſtairs, unſaying every word
I had ſaid in going down them.

that the multitude of ſad groups in it did but
diſtraćt me
——I took a fingle captive, and having firſt
ſhut him up in his dungeon, I then looked
through the twilight of his grated door to take
his picture.
I beheld his body half waſted away with long
expectation and confinement, and felt what kind
of ſickneſs of the heart it was which ariſes from
hope deferr'd. Upon looking nearer I ſaw him
pale and feveriſh : in thirty years the weſtern
breeze had not once fann’d his blood—he had
ſeen no ſun, no moon, in all that time—nor
had the voice of friend or kinſman breathed
through his lattice—his children—

I was forced to go on with another part of the
portrait.

ſtraw, in the furtheſt corner of his dungeon,

calendar of ſmall ſticks were laid at the head,
notch'd all over with the diſmal days and nights
he had paſſed there—he had one of theſe little
ſticks in his hand, and with a ruſty nail he was
etching another day of miſery to add to the heap.
As I darkened the little light he had, he lifted up
a hopeleſs eye towards the door, then caſt it
down—ſhook his head, and went on with his
work of afflićtion. I heard his chains upon his
legs, as he turned his body to lay his little ſtick
upon the bundle—He gave a deep ſigh—I ſaw

get a peep at what was going forwards, by ſeek-

arm and his body, trying firſt one ſide, then the
other; but the German ſtood ſquare in the moſt

I could have leaped out of the box to have re-

much leſs confuſion ; for leaning a little over,
and nodding to a centinel, and pointing at the

Tears are no proof of cowardice, Trim, I drop
them oft times myſelf, cried my uncle Toby—I
know your honour does, replied Trim, and foam
not aſhamed of it myſelf.--—But to think, may

ſtealing into the corner of his eye as he ſpoke

As few as any man, Trim, replied my uncle Toby:
nor can I ſee how a fellow of thy light heart
can ſuffer, but from the diſtreſs of poverty in
thy old age—when thou art paſſed all ſervices,
Trim, and haſt outlived thy friends.--An’pleaſe

—But I would have thee never fear, Trim, re-
plied my uncle Toby, and therefore, continued my
uncle Toby, throwing down his crutch, and get-

fore—in recompence, Trim, of thy long fidelity
to me, and that goodneſs of thy heart I have
had ſuch proofs of whilſt thy maſter is worth
a ſhilling—thou ſhalt never aſk elſewhere Trim,
for a penny. Trim attempted to thank my uncle
Toby, but had not power—tears trickled down
his checks faſter than he could wipe them off—
he laid his hands upon his breaſt—made a bow
to the ground, and ſhut the door.
—I have left Trim my bowling-green, cried
my uncle Toby.—My father ſmiled.—I have left
him moreover a penſion, continued my uncle
Toby.—My father looked grave.

re&t him to the diſcovery of this great end of all
his wiſhes 2
He is told by one to ſearch for it among the
more gay and youthful pleaſures of life, in ſcenes

laughter which he will ſee at once painted in her

in the midſt of much pomp and outward ſtate.

thrifty dwellings of the prudent man, who knows
and underſtands the worth of money, and cau-
tiouſly lays it up againſt an evil hour: that it is
not the proſtitution of wealth upon the paſſions,
or the parting with it at all that conſtitutes hap-
pineſs—but that it is the keeping it together,
and the Ibating and bottling it faſt to him and
his heirs for ever, which are the chief attri-

immediately in his ſenſes—he ſends the enquirer
there;—tells him 'tis in vain to ſearch elſewhere
for it, than where nature herſelf has placed it—
in the indulgence and gratification of the appe-
tites, which are given us for that end: and in
a word—if he will not take his opinion in the

there was no reſt found for her, and was fled into
ſolitude far from all commerce of the world;

all experiments, and generally ſits down wearied

by her own unqueſtionable authority certain
boundaries and fences to circumſcribe the diſcon-
tent of man : ſhe has effected her purpoſe in the
quieteſt and eaſieſt manner by laying him under
almoſt inſuperable obligations to work out his
eaſe, and to ſuſtain his ſufferings at home. It is
there only that ſhe has provided him with the
moſt ſuitable obječts to partake of his happineſs,
and bear a part of that burden which, in all
countries and ages, has ever been too heavy for
one pair of ſhoulders. 'Tis true we are endued
with an imperfect power of ſpreading our hap-
pineſs ſometimes beyond her limits, but 'tis ſo
ordered, that from the want of languages, con-

Pride is a vice which grows up in ſociety

is virtuous, could never break the ſpirits of a
man; all its hunger, and pain, and nakedneſs,
are nothing to it, they have ſome counterpoiſe
of good ; and beſides they are directed by Provi-
dence, and muſt be ſubmitted to ; but thoſe are
afflićtions not from the hand of God or Nature—
“for they do come forth of the Dust, and moſt
properly may be ſaid to ſpring out of the GRound,
and this is the reaſon they lay ſuch ſtreſs upon
our patience,—and in the end create ſuch a diſ-
truſt of the world, as makes us look up—and
pray, Let me fall into thy hands, O God! but let
me not fall into the hands of men.”

of every ſon and daughter of Adam; we uſually
fpeak of it as one of nature’s levities, though

It is to this ſpur which is ever in our ſides,
that we owe the impatience of this deſire for
travelling: the paſſion is no way bad, but as
others are, in its miſmanagement or exceſs ;

V E all of us talk ſo loud againſt vicious cha-
- racters, and are ſo unanimous in our cry
againſt them, that an unexperienced man, who
only truſted his ears, would imagine the whole
world was in an uproar about it, and that man-
kind were all aſſociating together, to hunt vice
utterly out of the world.——Shift the ſcene,—
and let him behold the reception which vice
meets with, he will ſee the condućt and beha-
viour of the world towards it ſo oppoſite to
their declarations,—he will find all he heard ſo
contradicted by what he ſaw, as to leave him
in doubt which of his ſenſes he is to truſt,-or
in which of the two caſes mankind were really
in earneſt. Was there virtue enough in the
world to make a general ſtand againſt this con-
tradiction ;-that is, was every one who de-
ſerved to be ill-ſpoken of-fure to be ill looked
on—too ; was it a certain conſequence of the
loſs of a man’s character, to loſe his friends,-
to loſe the advantages of his birth and fortune,—

Or, in a word, could it be eſtabliſhed as a
law in our ceremonial,—that wherever charac-
ters in either ſex were become notorious, it
ſhould be deemed infamous, either to pay or
receive a viſit from them, and that the door
ſhould be ſhut againſt them in all public places,
till they had ſatisfied the world, by giving teſti-
mony of a better life.—A few ſuch plain and
honeſt maxims, faithfully put in practice,—
would force us upon ſome degree of reforma-
tion. Till this is done, it avails little that we
have no mercy upon them with our tongues,
ſince they eſcape without feeling any other in-
convenience.
We all cry out that the world is corrupt.-

what we have to thank for it, and that our
open countenance of vice, which gives the lie
to our private cenſures of it, is its chief protec-

who ſtill believe that evil ſpeaking is ſome terror
to evil doers, one may anſwer, as a great man
has done upon the occaſion,-that after all our
exhortations againſt it—it is not to be feared
but that there will be evil ſpeaking enough left
in the world to chaſtiſe the guilty;—and we
may ſafely truſt them to an ill-natured world,
that there will be no failure of juſtice upon this
ſcore.—The paſſions of men are pretty ſevere
executioners, and to them let us leave this un-
grateful taſk;-and rather ourſelves endeavour
to cultivate that more friendly one, recommend-
ed by the apoſtle, of letting all bitterneſs, and
wrath, and clamour, and evil ſpeaking, be put
away from us ;-of being kind to one another,
tender-hearted, forgiving one another, even
as God for Chriſt's ſake forgave us.

—He ſaid, they were ſent him only to be got
bound, and were to be ſent back to Verſailles

is more to his honour, Monſieur, he loves the
Engliſh too. You ſpeak this ſo civilly, ſaid I,
that it is enough to oblige an Engliſhman to lay
out a louis d’or or two at your ſhop—the book-
ſeller made a bow, and was going to ſay ſome-

de chambre to ſome devout woman of faſhion,
eame into the ſhop and aſked for Les Egarements
du Cºur & de l’Eſprit : the bookſeller gave her
the book directly ; ſhe pulled out a little green ſat-
tin purſe run round with a riband of the ſame
colour, and putting her finger and thumb into
it, ſhe took out the money, and paid for it.
As I had nothing more to ſtay me in the ſhop,
we both walked out of the door together.
—And what have you to do, my dear, ſaid I,
with The Wanderings of the Heart, who ſcarce
know yet you have one nor, till love has firſt
told you it, or ſome faithleſs ſhepherd has made
it ache, can'ſt thou ever be ſure it is ſo.-Le
Dieu m'en garde I ſaid the girl.—With reaſon,
ſaid I,-for if it is a good one, 'tis a pity it
ſhould be ſtolen : ’tis a little treaſure to thee,
and gives a better air to your face, than if it
was dreſſed out with pearls.
The young girl liſtened with a ſubmiſſive at-
tention, holding her fattin purſe by its riband
in her hand all the time—'Tis a very ſmall one,
ſaid I, taking hold of the bottom of it—ſhe held
it towards me—and there is very little in it, my
dear, ſaid I; but be as good as thou art handſome,
and

and heaven will fill it: I had a parcel of crowns
in my hand to pay for Shakeſpeare; and as ſhe
had let go the purſe entirely, I put a ſingle one
in ; and tying up the riband in a bow-knot,
returned it to her.
The young girl made me more an humble
courteſy than a low one—it was one of thoſe
quiet, thankful ſinkings where the ſpirit bows
itſelf down—the body does no more than tell
it. I never gave a girl a crown in my life which
gave me half the pleaſure.
My advice, my dear, would not have been
worth a pin to you, ſaid I, if I had not given
this along with it: but now, when you ſee the
crown, you will remember it—ſo do not, my
dear, lay it out in ribands.
Upon my word, Sir, ſaid the girl, earneſtly,
I am incapable—in ſaying which, as is uſual in
little bargains of honour, ſhe gave me her hand

both our roads lay the ſame way, we made no.
ſcruple of walking along the Quai de Conti to-
gether. -
She made me a ſecond courteſy in ſetting off,
and before we got twenty yards from the door,
as if ſhe had not done enough before, ſhe made
aſort of a little ſtop to tell me again,_ſhe thank-
ed me.
It was a ſmall tribute, I told her, which I
could not avoid paying to virtue, and would not
be miſtaken in the perſon I had been rendering
it to for the world—but I ſee innocence, my
dear, in your face—and foul befall the man who
ever lays a ſhare in its way !
The girl ſeemed affected ſome way or other
with what I ſaid—ſhe gave a low figh—I found
I was not empowered to enquire at all after it—
ſo ſaid nothing more till I got to the corner of
the Rue de Nevers, where we were to part.
—But is this the way, my dear, ſaid I, to
the hotel de Modene 2 ſhe told me it was—or,
that I might go by the Rue de Gueneguault,
which

dear, by the Rue de Gueneguault, ſaid I, for two
reaſons; firſt I ſhall pleaſe myſelf, and next I
ſhall give you the protection of my company as
far on your way as I can. The girl was ſenſible
I was civil—and ſaid ſhe wiſhed the hotel de
Modene was in the Rue de St. Pierre.—You live
there 2 ſaid I.-She told me ſhe was fille de
chambre to Madame R^*—Good God ſaid
I, it is the very lady for whom I have brought
a letter from Amiens—The girl told me that
Madame Rºº, ſhebelieved, expected a ſtranger
with a letter, and was impatient to ſee him—
ſo I deſired the girl to preſent my compliments,
to Madame R*, and ſay I would certainly
wait upon her in the morning.

We ſet off afreſh, and as ſhe took her third
ſtep, the girl put her hand within my arm—I
was juſt bidding her—but ſhe did it of herſelf,
with that undeliberating ſimplicity, which ſhew-
ed it was out of her head that ſhe had never
ſeen me before. For my own part, I felt the
convićtion of conſanguinity ſo ſtrongly, that I
could not help turning half round to lock in her
face, and ſee if I could trace out any thing in it
of a family likeneſs—Tut! ſaid I, are we not
all relations 2
When we arrived at the turning up of the
Rue de Guenéguault, I ſtopped to bid her adieu
for good and all: the girl would thank me again
for my company and kindneſs—She bid me
adieu twice—I repeated it as often ; and ſo
cordial was the parting between us, that had it
happened any where elſe, I’m not ſure but I
ſhould have ſigned it with a kiſs of charity, as
warm and holy as an apoſtle. -

who, without convićtion of doing much wrong,
in the midſt of a full career of calumny and de-

they return,-go, -and kneel down before the

This deluſive itch for ſlander, too common in
all ranks of people, whether to gratify a little un-
generous reſentment:—whether oftener out of a
principle of levelling, from a narrowneſs and po-
verty of ſoul, ever impatient of merit and ſupe-
riority in others; whether a mean ambition, or
the inſatiate luſt of being witty, (a talent in
which ill-nature and malice are no ingredients;)

all jointly, we are indebted for this contagious
malady; thus much is certain, from whatever
ſeeds it ſprings, the growth and progreſs of it
are as deſtructive to, as they are unbecoming a
civilized people. To paſs a hard and ill-natured
reflection, upon an undeſigning ačtion ; to in-
vent, or, which is equally bad, to propagate a
vexatious report, without colour and grounds;
to plunder an innocent man of his chara&ter
and good name, a jewel which perhaps he has
ſtarved himſelf to purchaſe, and probably would
hazard his life to ſecure ; to rob him at the
ſame time of his happineſs and peace of mind;
perhaps his bread,—the bread, may be, of a vir-
tuous family ; and all this, as Solomon ſays of
the madman, who caſteth fire-brands, arrows,
and death, and ſaith, Am I not in ſport 2 all
this, out of wantonneſs, and oftener from worſe
motives ; the whole appears ſuch a complica-
tion of badneſs, as requires no words or warmth
of fancy to aggravate. Pride, treachery, envy,
hypocriſy, malice, cruelty, and ſelf-love, may
have been ſaid, in one ſhape or other, to have
occaſioned all the frauds and miſchiefs that ever
happened in the world: but the chances againſt
a coincidence of them all in one perſon are ſo

OW frequently is the honeſty and integrity
of a man diſpoſed of, by a ſmile or a
ſhrug :—how many good and generous actions
have been ſunk into oblivion, by a diſtruſtful look,
or ſtampt with the imputation of proceeding
from bad motives, by a myſterious and ſeaſon-
able whiſper.
Ilook into companies of thoſe whoſe gen-
tle natures ſhould diſarm them, we ſhall find no
better account.—How large a portion of chaſti-
ty is ſent out of the world by diſtant hints,
nodded away and cruelly winked into ſuſpicion,
by the envy of thoſe who are paſt all temptation
of it themſelves? How often does the reputation
of a helpleſs creature bleed by a report—which
the party, who is at the pains to propagate
it, beholds with much pity and fellow-feel-
ing,-that ſhe is heartily ſorry for it,
hopes in God it is not true : however, as
Archbiſhop Tillotſon wittily obſerves upon it, is
reſolved, in the mean time, to give the report
her paſs, that at leaſt it may have fair play to
take its fortune in the world,—to be believed or
not,

not, according to the charity of thoſe into whoſe
hands it ſhall happen to fall?
So fruitful is this vice in variety of expedients,
to ſatiate as well as diſguiſe itſelf. But if theſe
ſmoother weapons cut ſo ſore, what ſhall we
ſay of open and unbluſhing ſcandal—ſubjected to
no caution, tied down to no reſtraints?—If the
one, like an arrow ſhot in the dark, does never-
theleſs ſo much ſecret miſchief, this, like the
peſtilence, which rageth at noon-day, ſweeps
all before it, levelling without diſtinction the
good and the bad; a thouſand fall beſide it, and
ten thouſand on its right hand;—they fall—ſo
rent and torn in this tender part of them, ſo un-
mercifully butchered, as ſometimes never to re-
cover either the wounds,--or the anguiſh of
heart which they have occaſioned.
But there is nothing ſo bad which will not
admit of ſomething to be ſaid in its defence.
And here it may be aſked,—whether the in-
conveniences and ill-effects which the world feels,
from the licentiouſneſs of this pračtice—are not
ſufficiently counterbalanced by the real influence
it has upon men's lives and conduct 2—that if

there was no evil-ſpeaking in the world, thou-
ſands would be encouraged to do ill,—and would
ruſh into many indecorums, like a horſe into the
battle,_were they ſure to eſcape the tongues
of men.
That if we take a general view of the world,
—we ſhall find, that a great deal of virtue,
at leaſt of the outward appearance of it, is not
ſo much from any fixed principle, as the terror
of what the world will ſay, -and the liberty it
will take upon the occaſions we ſhall give.
That if we deſcend to particulars, numbers are
every day taking more pains to be well ſpoken
of, than what would actually enable them to
live ſo as to deſerve it.
That there are many of both ſexes who can
ſupport life well enough without honour or
chaſtity, who, without reputation, (which is
but the opinion which the world has of the mat-
ter), would hide their heads in ſhame, and ſink
down in utter deſpair of happineſs.—No doubt
the tongue is a weapon which does chaſtiſe ma-
ny indecorums which the laws of men will not
reach,-and keeps many in awe-whom con-

ſcience will not;-and where the caſe is indiſ-
putably flagrant, the ſpeaking of it in ſuch
words as it deſerves—ſcarce comes within the
prohibition.—In many caſes it is hard to ex-
preſs ourſelves ſo as to fix a diſtinétion betwixt
oppoſite chara&ters 5–and ſometimes it may be
as much a debt we owe to virtue, and as great
a piece of juſtice to expoſe a vicious charaćter,
and paint it in its proper colours, as it is to
ſpeak well of the deſerving, and deſcribe his par-
ticular virtues.—And, indeed, when we inflićt
this puniſhment upon the bad, merely out of
principle, and without indulgencies to any pri-
vate paſſion of our own, it is a caſe which hap-
pens ſo ſeldom, that one might venture to ex-
cept it.

humility calls no man down from his rank, di-
veſts not princes of their titles; it is in life
what the clear obſcure is in painting ; it makes
the hero ſtep forth in the canvas, and detaches
his figure from the group in which he would
otherwiſe ſtand confounded for ever.

thy fortune—or what is better, the greatneſs
of thy ſoul, in the meekneſs of thy converſation;

great ; but let it be in conſidering riches as they
are, as talents committed to an earthen veſſel—
That thou art but the receiver,-and that to be
obliged and to be vain too, is but the old ſole-

JUSTICE

<page 309>
272 THE BEAUTIES OF STERNE.
JUSTICE AND HONESTY.
USTICE and honeſty contribute very much
towards all the faculties of the mind: I
mean, that it clears up the underſtanding from
that miſt, which dark and crooked deſigns are apt
to raiſe in it, and that it keeps up a regulari-
ty in the affections, by ſuffering no luſts or by-
ends to diſorder them.—That it likewiſe, pre-
ſerves the mind from all damps of grief and
melancholy, which are the ſure conſequences of
unjuſt ačtions; and that by ſuch an improve-
ment of the faculties, it makes a man ſo much
the abler to diſcern, and ſo much the more cheer-
ful, ačtive, and diligent to mind his buſineſs.—
Light is ſown for the righteous, ſays the pro-
phet, and gladneſs for the upright in heart.
Secondly, let it be obſerved,—that in the con-
tinuance and courſe of a virtuous man's affairs,
there is little probability of his falling into con-
ſiderable diſappointments or calamities ;-not
only becauſe guarded by the providence of God,
but that honeſty is in its own nature the freeſt
from danger.
Firſt,

<page 310>
THE BEAUTIES OF STERNE 273
Firſt, becauſe ſuch a one lays no proječts,
which it is the intereſt of another to blaſt, and
therefore needs no indirect methods or deceitful
practices to ſecure his intereſt by undermin-
ing others.—The paths of virtue are plain and
ſtraight, ſo that the blind, perſons of the mean-
eſt capacity, ſhall not err.—Diſhoneſty requires
ſkill to conduct it, and as great art to conceal
—what 'tis every one’s intereſt to detect. And
I think I need not remind you how oft it hap-
pens in attempts of this kind—where worldly
men, in haſte to be rich, have over-run the only
means to it,-and for want of laying their con-
trivances with proper cunning, or managing
them with proper ſecreſy and advantage, have
loſt for ever, what they might have certainly
ſecured with honeſty and plain-dealing.—The
general cauſes of the diſappointments in their
buſineſs, or of the unhappineſs in their lives,
lying but too manifeſtly in their own diſorderly
paſſions, which by attempting to carry them a
ſhorter way toriches and honour, diſappoint them
of both for ever, and make plain their ruin is
from themſelves, and that they eat the fruits,
which their own hands have watered and ripened.

OW cop did intend them,-may as well be
known from an appeal to your own hearts,
and the inſcription you ſhall read there, as
from any chapter and verſe I might cite upon
the ſubject. Let us then for a moment turn
our eyes that way, and conſider the traces
which even the moſt inſenſible man may have
proof of, from what he may perceive ſpringing
up within him from ſome caſual act of genero-
ſity; and though this is a pleaſure which pro-
perly belongs to the good, yet let him try the
experiment ;—let him comfort the captive, or
cover the naked with a garment, and he will
feel what is meant by that moral delight ariſing
in the mind from the conſcience of a humane
action.
But to know it right, we muſt call upon the
compaſſionate;—cruelty gives evidence unwil-
lingly, and feels the pleaſure but imperſe&tly ;
for this, like all other pleaſures, is of a relative
nature, and conſequently the enjoyment of it,
requires

<page 312>
THE BEAUTIES OF STERNE. 275
requires ſome qualification in the faculty, as
much as the enjoyment of any other good does:
—there muſt be ſomething antecedent in the
diſpoſition and temper which will render that
good, La good to that individual; otherwiſe,
though 'tis true it may be poſſeſſed,—yet it
never can be enjoyed.

fore the arbitrator is called into the debate;—

paſſions govern the whole man, 'tis melan-

MISFORTUNE AND CONSOLATION.
HERE is not an object in this world which
cop can be ſuppoſed to look down upon
with greater pleaſure, than that of a good man
involved in misfortunes, ſurrounded on all ſides
with difficulties—yet cheerfully bearing up his
head, and ſtruggling againſt them with firmneſs
and conſtancy of mind.—Certainly to our con-
ceptions ſuch objects muſt be truly engaging:—
and the reaſon of ſo exalted an encomium from
this hand, is eaſily to be gueſſed: no doubt the
wiſeſt of the heathen philoſophers had found,
from *
--ºl

<page 314>
THE BEAUTIES OF STERN.E. 277
from obſervation upon the life of man, that the
many troubles and infirmities of his nature, the
ſickneſſes, diſappointments, ſorrows, for the loſs
of children or property, with the numberleſs
other calamities and croſs accidents to which
the life of man is ſubject, were in themſelves ſo
great ;-and ſo little ſolid comfort to be admi-
iniſtered from the mere refinements of philoſo-
phy in ſuch emergencies, that there was no vir-
tue which required greater efforts, or which was
found ſo difficult to be achieved upon moral
principles ; upon moral principles—which had
no foundation to ſuſtain this great weight, which
the infirmities of our nature laid upon it. And
for this reaſon 'tis obſervable that there is no
ſubječt, upon which the moral writers of anti-
quity have exhauſted ſo much of their eloquence,
or where they have ſpent ſuch time and pains,
as in this of endeavouring to reconcile men to
theſe evils. Inſomuch, that from thence, in
moſt modern languages the patient enduring of
afflićtion has by degrees obtained the name of
philoſophy, and almoſt monopolized the word
to itſelf, as if it was the chief end or compen-
dium of all the wiſdom which philoſophy had to
offer. And indeed, conſidering what lights they
had, ſome of them wrote extremely well; yet,

as what they ſaid proceeded more from the head
than the heart, 'twas generally more calculated
to ſilence a man in his troubles, than to convince,
and teach him how to bear them. And there-
fore however ſubtle and ingenious their argu-
ments might appear in the reading, 'tis to be
feared they loſt much of their efficacy, when
tried in the application. If a man was thruſt
back in the world by diſappointments, or—as
was Job’s caſe—had ſuffered a ſudden change in
his fortunes, from an affluent condition was
brought down by a train of cruel accidents,
and pinched with poverty—philoſophy would
come in, and exhort him to ſtand his ground ;
—it would tell him that the ſame greatneſs
and ſtrength of mind which enabled him to be-
have well in the days of his proſperity, ſhould
equally enable him to behave well in the days
of his adverſity ;-that it was the property of
only weak and baſe ſpirits, who were inſolent
in the one, to be deječied and overthrown by the
other; whereas great and generous ſouls were
at all times calm and equal.—As they enjoyed
the advantages of life with indifference,—they
were able to reſign them with the ſame temper,-
and conſequently—were out of the reach of for-
tune. Allwhich, however fine, and likely to ſatisfy
the

<page 316>
THE BEAUTIFs of s ºf 279
the fancy of a tº an at eaſe, could convey but
little conſolation to a heart already pierced with
ſorrow ; –nor is it to be conceived how an unfor-
tunate creature ſhould any more receive relief
from ſuch a le&ture, however juſt, than a man
racked with an acute fit of the gout or ſtone,
could be ſuppoſed to be ſet free from torture,
by hearing from his phyſician a nice diſſertation
upon his caſe. The philoſophic conſolations in
ſickneſs, or in afflićtions for the death of friends
and kindred, were juſt as effacacious ;-and
were rather in general to be conſidered as good
ſayings than good remedies.—So that, if a
man was bereaved of a promiſing child, in
whom all his hopes and expectations centered,
—or a wife was left deſtitute to mourn.the loſs
and protećtion of a kind and tender huſband,
Seneca or Epićietus would tell the penſive parent
and diſconſolate widow—that tears and lamen-
tation for the dead were fruitleſs and abſurd ;
that to die was the neceſſary and unavoidable
debt of nature ;-and as it could admit of
no remedy—’twas impious and fooliſh to grieve
and fret themſelves upon it.
Upon ſuch ſage council, as well as many
other leſſons of the ſame ſtamp, the ſame reflec-
tion

tion might be applied, which is ſaid to have
been made by one of the Roman Emperors, to
one who adminiſtered the ſame conſolations to
him, ou a like occaſion,--to whom adviſing him
to be comforted, and make himſelf eaſy, ſince
the cvent had been brought about by a fatality,
and could not be helped,—he replied,—“That
this was ſo far from leſſening his trouble, that
it was the very circumſtance which occaſioned
it.”—So that upon the whole—when the true
value of theſe, and many more of their current
arguments have been weighed and brought to
the teſt,-one is led to doubt, whether the
greateſt part of their heroes, the moſt renowned
for conſtancy, were not much more indebt-
ed to good nerves and ſpirits, or the natu-
ral happy frame of their tempers, for behaving
well, than to any extraordinary helps, which
they could be ſuppoſed to receive from their in-
ſtructors. And therefore I ſhould make no ſcru-
ple to aſſert, that one ſuch inſtance of patience
and reſignation as this, which the ſcripture
gives us in the perſon of Job, not of one moſt
pompouſly declaiming upon the contempt of
pain and poverty, but of a man ſunk in the
loweſt condition of humanity, to behold him
when ſtripped of his eſtate, his wealth, his
friends,

head, and entertaining his hard fortune with
firmneſs and ſerenity;-and this, not from a
ſtoical ſtupidity, but a juſt ſenſe of God’s provi-
dence, and a perſuaſion of his juſtice and good-
neſs in all his dealings Such an example, I
ſay, as this, is of more univerſal uſe, ſpeaks
truer to the heart, than all the heroic precepts,
which the pedantry of philoſophy have to offer.
